## Choose Your Contributing Path

### Team-Assisted Path (Recommended)

**Allow the Polkadot Docs team to handle formatting and style**

 **Benefits:**

- Faster review process
- Fewer style-related review comments
- Team handles technical formatting requirements

 **Your responsibility:**

- Working code and clear instructions
- Following essential requirements below

 **Important:** Enable "Allow edits by maintainers" on your PR

**Required:** You must read the [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md) to understand all requirements. The difference is that with the team-assisted path, they will have the bandwidth to handle the review process.

### Self-Managed Path

**Handle all formatting and style requirements yourself**

 **Full control** over your tutorial format and style
 **More review rounds** - you must fix all style issues
 **Required reading:** [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md)
 **For expedited review:** Also read the [PaperMoon Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/papermoonio/documentation-style-guide).

# Team-Assisted Path: Essential Requirements

## Essential Requirements

### 1. Metadata (Required)

```yaml
---
title: Tutorial Title (max 45 chars)
description: Description 120-160 chars
tutorial_badge: Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced
categories: Category1, Category2
---
```

### 2. File Structure (Required)

Once you've defined your tutorial path, ensure images and code snippets follow the same structure.

**Tutorial file:**
```
tutorials/[category]/[subcategory]/[tutorial-name].md
```

**Supporting files:**
```
images/tutorials/[category]/[subcategory]/[tutorial-name]/
.snippets/code/tutorials/[category]/[subcategory]/[tutorial-name]/
```

**Image naming convention:**
```
images/tutorials/[category]/[subcategory]/[tutorial-name]/[tutorial-name-01.webp]
```
Where the number will be 01, 02, 03, etc.

### 3. Navigation Update (Critical)

**Must update `.nav.yml` files** or your tutorial won't appear in the left-side menu:
```yaml
# In appropriate .nav.yml file
- 'Display Title': tutorial-filename.md
```

### 4. Working Code & Tests (Required)

- All code examples must be tested and functional
- **Always specify dependency versions** (e.g., `npm install polkadot-api@1.16.0`)
- Include verification steps
- Test on clean environment before submitting

## Tutorial Categories

- **polkadot-sdk/**: Parachains, pallets, runtime development
- **smart-contracts/**: EVM, PVM, demo applications  
- **interoperability/**: XCM operations, channel management
- **dapps/**: Frontend integration, API usage
- **onchain-governance/**: Proposals, OpenGov operations
