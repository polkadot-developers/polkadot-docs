# [Your Tutorial Title]

## Introduction

[2-3 paragraphs explaining:]
- What users will build/configure in this tutorial
- Why this is important for Polkadot SDK development
- What specific skills or components they'll learn

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Rust toolchain installed (latest stable)
- Polkadot SDK development environment set up
- [Specific tools/dependencies for this tutorial]
- Basic understanding of [required concepts]
- [Tokens/accounts if needed]

## Environment Setup

[Set up the development environment and project structure]

```bash
# Commands for initial setup
git clone -b INSERT_TAG_HERE https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template.git parachain-template
```

!!! note
    Replace `INSERT_TAG_HERE` with the actual tag or branch of the parachain template you want to use (e.g., `polkadot-stable2412`).

Expected output:
```

```

## Step 2: [Main Development Phase]

[Core implementation steps - adjust based on tutorial type:]

### For Parachain Development:
- Configure runtime
- Add custom pallets
- Set up chain specification

### For Pallet Development:
- Define storage items
- Implement extrinsics
- Add tests

```rust
// Example code with clear comments
#[pallet::storage]
pub type SomeValue<T> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
```

!!!tip
    Explain key concepts or provide helpful context here.

## Step 3: Testing and Verification

Test your implementation:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

Verify everything works by:
1. [Specific verification step 1]
2. [Specific verification step 2]
3. [Expected behavior/output]

## Step 4: [Advanced Configuration - if applicable]

[Optional advanced steps for intermediate/advanced tutorials]
