- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/for-eth-devs/accounts/
- Summary: Bridges Ethereum's 20-byte addresses with Polkadot's 32-byte accounts, enabling seamless interaction while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum tooling.

# Accounts on Asset Hub Smart Contracts

## Introduction

Asset Hub natively utilizes Polkadot's 32-byte account system while providing interoperability with Ethereum's 20-byte addresses through an automatic conversion system. When interacting with smart contracts:

- Ethereum-compatible wallets (like MetaMask) can use their familiar 20-byte addresses.
- Polkadot accounts continue using their native 32-byte format.
- The Asset Hub chain automatically handles conversion between the two formats behind the scenes:

    - 20-byte Ethereum addresses are padded with `0xEE` bytes to create valid 32-byte Polkadot accounts.
    - 32-byte Polkadot accounts can optionally register a mapping to a 20-byte address for Ethereum compatibility.

This dual-format approach enables Asset Hub to maintain compatibility with Ethereum tooling while fully integrating with the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Address Types and Mappings

The platform handles two distinct address formats:

- [Ethereum-style addresses (20 bytes)](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/accounts/#account-creation){target=\_blank}
- [Polkadot native account IDs (32 bytes)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-account-advanced/#address-format){target=\_blank}



### Ethereum to Polkadot Mapping

The [`AccountId32Mapper`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/struct.AccountId32Mapper.html){target=\_blank} implementation in [`pallet_revive`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} handles the core address conversion logic. For converting a 20-byte Ethereum address to a 32-byte Polkadot address, the pallet uses a simple concatenation approach:

- [**Core mechanism**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_fallback_account_id){target=\_blank}: Takes a 20-byte Ethereum address and extends it to 32 bytes by adding twelve `0xEE` bytes at the end. The key benefits of this approach are:
    - Able to fully revert, allowing a smooth transition back to the Ethereum format.
    - Provides clear identification of Ethereum-controlled accounts through the `0xEE` suffix pattern.
    - Maintains cryptographic security with a `2^96` difficulty for pattern reproduction.

### Polkadot to Ethereum Mapping

The conversion from 32-byte Polkadot accounts to 20-byte Ethereum addresses is more complex than the reverse direction due to the lossy nature of the conversion. The [`AccountId32Mapper`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/struct.AccountId32Mapper.html){target=\_blank} handles this through two distinct approaches:

- **For Ethereum-derived accounts**: The system uses the [`is_eth_derived`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/fn.is_eth_derived.html){target=\_blank} function to detect accounts that were originally Ethereum addresses (identified by the `0xEE` suffix pattern). For these accounts, the conversion strips the last 12 bytes to recover the original 20-byte Ethereum address.

- **For native Polkadot accounts**: Since these accounts utilize the whole 32-byte space and weren't derived from Ethereum addresses, direct truncation would result in lost information. Instead, the system:

    1. Hashes the entire 32-byte account using Keccak-256.
    2. Takes the last 20 bytes of the hash to create the Ethereum address.
    3. This ensures a deterministic mapping while avoiding simple truncation.

The conversion process is implemented through the [`to_address`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_address){target=\_blank} function, which automatically detects the account type and applies the appropriate conversion method.

**Stateful Mapping for Reversibility** : Since the conversion from 32-byte to 20-byte addresses is inherently lossy, the system provides an optional stateful mapping through the [`OriginalAccount`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/storage_types/struct.OriginalAccount.html){target=\_blank} storage. When a Polkadot account registers a mapping (via the [`map`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.map){target=\_blank} function), the system stores the original 32-byte account ID, enabling the [`to_account_id`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_account_id){target=\_blank} function to recover the exact original account rather than falling back to a default conversion.


### Account Mapping for Native Polkadot Accounts

If you have a native Polkadot account (32-byte format) that was created with a Polkadot/Substrate keypair (Ed25519/Sr25519) rather than an Ethereum-compatible keypair (secp256k1), you'll need to map your account to enable Ethereum compatibility.

To map your account, call the [`map_account`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/dispatchables/fn.map_account.html){target=\_blank} extrinsic of the [`pallet_revive`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet using your original Substrate account. This creates a stateful mapping that allows your 32-byte account to interact with the Ethereum-compatible smart contract system.

Once mapped, you'll be able to:

- Transfer funds between 20-byte format addresses.
- Interact with smart contracts using Ethereum-compatible tools like MetaMask.
- Maintain full reversibility to your original 32-byte account format.

!!! warning "Mapping Requirement"
    Without this mapping, native Polkadot accounts cannot transfer funds or interact with the Ethereum-compatible layer on the Hub.

## Account Registration

The registration process is implemented through the [`map`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.map){target=\_blank} function. This process involves:

- Checking if the account is already mapped.
- Calculating and collecting required deposits based on data size.
- Storing the address suffix for future reference.
- Managing the currency holds for security.

## Fallback Accounts

The fallback mechanism is integrated into the [`to_account_id`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_account_id){target=\_blank} function. It provides a safety net for address conversion by:

- First, attempting to retrieve stored mapping data.
- Falling back to the default conversion method if no mapping exists.
- Maintaining consistency in address representation.

## Contract Address Generation

The system supports two methods for generating contract addresses:

- [CREATE1 method](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/fn.create1.html){target=\_blank}:

    - Uses the deployer address and nonce.
    - Generates deterministic addresses for standard contract deployment.

- [CREATE2 method](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/fn.create2.html){target=\_blank}:

    - Uses the deployer address, initialization code, input data, and salt.
    - Enables predictable address generation for advanced use cases.

## Security Considerations

The address mapping system maintains security through several design choices evident in the implementation:

- The stateless mapping requires no privileged operations, as shown in the [`to_fallback_account_id`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_fallback_account_id){target=\_blank} implementation.
- The stateful mapping requires a deposit managed through the [`Currency`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.Currency){target=\_blank} trait.
- Mapping operations are protected against common errors through explicit checks.
- The system prevents double-mapping through the [`ensure!(!Self::is_mapped(account_id))`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/stable2412/substrate/frame/revive/src/address.rs#L125){target=\_blank} check.

All source code references are from the [`address.rs`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/stable2412/substrate/frame/revive/src/address.rs){target=\_blank} file in the Revive pallet of the Polkadot SDK repository.

# Blocks

## Introduction

In the Polkadot SDK, blocks are fundamental to the functioning of the blockchain, serving as containers for [transactions](/reference/parachains/blocks-transactions-fees/transactions/){target=\_blank} and changes to the chain's state. Blocks consist of headers and an array of transactions, ensuring the integrity and validity of operations on the network. This guide explores the essential components of a block, the process of block production, and how blocks are validated and imported across the network. By understanding these concepts, developers can better grasp how blockchains maintain security, consistency, and performance within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## What is a Block?

In the Polkadot SDK, a block is a fundamental unit that encapsulates both the header and an array of transactions. The block header includes critical metadata to ensure the integrity and sequence of the blockchain. Here's a breakdown of its components:

- **Block height**: Indicates the number of blocks created in the chain so far.
- **Parent hash**: The hash of the previous block, providing a link to maintain the blockchain's immutability.
- **Transaction root**: Cryptographic digest summarizing all transactions in the block.
- **State root**: A cryptographic digest representing the post-execution state.
- **Digest**: Additional information that can be attached to a block, such as consensus-related messages.

Each transaction is part of a series that is executed according to the runtime's rules. The transaction root is a cryptographic digest of this series, which prevents alterations and enables succinct verification by light clients. This verification process allows light clients to confirm whether a transaction exists in a block with only the block header, avoiding downloading the entire block.

## Block Production

When an authoring node is authorized to create a new block, it selects transactions from the transaction queue based on priority. This step, known as block production, relies heavily on the executive module to manage the initialization and finalization of blocks. The process is summarized as follows:

### Initialize Block

The block initialization process begins with a series of function calls that prepare the block for transaction execution:

1. **Call `on_initialize`**: The executive module calls the [`on_initialize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_initialize){target=\_blank} hook from the system pallet and other runtime pallets to prepare for the block's transactions.
2. **Coordinate runtime calls**: Coordinates function calls in the order defined by the transaction queue.
3. **Verify information**: Once [`on_initialize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_initialize){target=\_blank} functions are executed, the executive module checks the parent hash in the block header and the trie root to verify information is consistent.

### Finalize Block

Once transactions are processed, the block must be finalized before being broadcast to the network. The finalization steps are as follows:

1. **Call `on_finalize`**: The executive module calls the [`on_finalize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_finalize){target=\_blank} hooks in each pallet to ensure any remaining state updates or checks are completed before the block is sealed and published.
2. **Verify information**: The block's digest and storage root in the header are checked against the initialized block to ensure consistency.
3. **Call `on_idle`**: The [`on_idle`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_idle){target=\_blank} hook is triggered to process any remaining tasks using the leftover weight from the block.

## Block Authoring and Import

Once the block is finalized, it is gossiped to other nodes in the network. Nodes follow this procedure:

1. **Receive transactions**: The authoring node collects transactions from the network.
2. **Validate**: Transactions are checked for validity.
3. **Queue**: Valid transactions are placed in the transaction pool for execution.
4. **Execute**: State changes are made as the transactions are executed.
5. **Publish**: The finalized block is broadcast to the network.

### Block Import Queue

After a block is published, other nodes on the network can import it into their chain state. The block import queue is part of the outer node in every Polkadot SDK-based node and ensures incoming blocks are valid before adding them to the node's state.

In most cases, you don't need to know details about how transactions are gossiped or how other nodes on the network import blocks. The following traits are relevant, however, if you plan to write any custom consensus logic or want a deeper dive into the block import queue:

- **[`ImportQueue`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/trait.ImportQueue.html){target=\_blank}**: The trait that defines the block import queue.
- **[`Link`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/trait.Link.html){target=\_blank}**: The trait that defines the link between the block import queue and the network.
- **[`BasicQueue`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/struct.BasicQueue.html){target=\_blank}**: A basic implementation of the block import queue.
- **[`Verifier`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/trait.Verifier.html){target=\_blank}**: The trait that defines the block verifier.
- **[`BlockImport`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/block_import/trait.BlockImport.html){target=\_blank}**: The trait that defines the block import process.

These traits govern how blocks are validated and imported across the network, ensuring consistency and security.

- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/chain-interactions/send-transactions/calculate-transaction-fees/
- Summary: Learn how to calculate transaction fees on Polkadot using Polkadot-API, Polkadot.js API, and the Polkadot.js Apps UI to estimate transfer costs.

# Calculate Transaction Fees

## Introduction

Transaction fees are essential costs for executing operations on Polkadot and its parachains. Understanding how to estimate these fees helps you manage account balances and build better user experiences in your applications. 

This tutorial will guide you through different methods for calculating transaction fees.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/){target=\_blank} version 18 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
- Test accounts with sufficient balance to pay transaction fees

!!! note
    Transaction fees on Polkadot are calculated based on three components: a base fee, a length fee (proportional to transaction size), and a weight fee (proportional to computational complexity). An optional tip can be added to prioritize transaction inclusion.

## Polkadot-API (PAPI)

[Polkadot-API](/reference/tools/papi){target=\_blank} is the modern, recommended library for building TypeScript applications with type safety and light client support.

Create a new project directory and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir fee-calculator
cd fee-calculator
npm init -y && npm pkg set type=module
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install polkadot-api
npm install --save-dev typescript tsx
```

Add the Polkadot relay chain to generate type-safe descriptors:

```bash
npx papi add polkadotTestNet -w INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT
```

This command downloads the latest Polkadot metadata and generates TypeScript descriptors in the `@polkadot-api/descriptors` package. Ensure to replace `INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT` with the proper websocket endpoint. For this example, we will use the Polkadot Testnet (`wss://pas-rpc.stakeworld.io/assethub`).

Create a file named `papi-fee-calculator.ts`:

```typescript title="papi-fee-calculator.ts"
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';
import { polkadotTestNet } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider';

async function calculateFees() {
  // Connect to chain
  const client = createClient(
    withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT'))
  );

  // Get typed API
  const api = client.getTypedApi(polkadotTestNet);

  // Define sender and recipient addresses
  const aliceAddress = 'INSERT_ALICE_ADDRESS';
  const bobAddress = 'INSERT_BOB_ADDRESS';

  // Amount to transfer (1 DOT = 10^10 plancks)
  const amount = 10_000_000_000n; // 1 DOT

  try {
    // Create the transaction
    const tx = api.tx.Balances.transfer_keep_alive({
      dest: {
        type: 'Id',
        value: bobAddress,
      },
      value: amount,
    });

    // Estimate fees
    const estimatedFees = await tx.getEstimatedFees(aliceAddress);

    console.log(`Estimated fee: ${Number(estimatedFees) / 1e10} DOT`);
    console.log(`Transaction amount: ${Number(amount) / 1e10} DOT`);
    console.log(`Total deducted: ${Number(estimatedFees + amount) / 1e10} DOT`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calculating fees:', error);
  } finally {
    // Clean up
    client.destroy();
  }
}

calculateFees();
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT` with your WebSocket endpoint, `INSERT_ALICE_ADDRESS` with the sender's address, and `INSERT_BOB_ADDRESS` with the recipient's address.

Key aspects of the code:

- **Transaction creation**: The `api.tx.Balances.transfer_keep_alive()` method constructs a balance transfer transaction.
- **`dest` parameter**: Specifies the recipient using a `MultiAddress` type with `Id` variant.
- **`getEstimatedFees()`**: Returns the estimated fee in plancks (the smallest unit, where 1 DOT = 10^10 plancks).
- The method applies a dummy signature internally to simulate the transaction.

Execute the script using `tsx`:

```bash
npx tsx papi-fee-calculator.ts
```

You should see output similar to:

<div class="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx papi-fee-calculator.ts</span>
    <span data-ty="progress"></span>
    <span data-ty>Estimated fee: 0.0014668864 DOT</span>
    <span data-ty>Transaction amount: 1 DOT</span>
    <span data-ty>Total deducted: 1.0014668864 DOT</span>
</div>
## Polkadot.js API

[Polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/){target=\_blank} is a mature JavaScript/TypeScript library for interacting with Polkadot SDK-based chains, providing comprehensive RPC client functionality and transaction building capabilities.

In the same project directory (or a new one), install the Polkadot.js packages:

```bash
npm install @polkadot/api
```

Create a file named `polkadotjs-fee-calculator.ts`:

```typescript title="polkadotjs-fee-calculator.ts"
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

async function calculateFees() {
  // Connect to chain
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT');
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });

  // Wait for API to be ready
  await api.isReady;

  // Define sender and recipient addresses
  const aliceAddress = 'INSERT_ALICE_ADDRESS';
  const bobAddress = 'INSERT_BOB_ADDRESS';

  // Amount to transfer (1 DOT = 10^10 plancks)
  const amount = 10_000_000_000n; // 1 DOT

  try {
    // Create the transaction
    const tx = api.tx.balances.transferKeepAlive(bobAddress, amount);

    // Get payment information
    const paymentInfo = await tx.paymentInfo(aliceAddress);

    console.log(
      `Estimated fee: ${Number(paymentInfo.partialFee.toBigInt()) / 1e10} DOT`
    );
    console.log(`Transaction amount: ${Number(amount) / 1e10} DOT`);
    console.log(
      `Total deducted: ${
        Number(paymentInfo.partialFee.toBigInt() + amount) / 1e10
      } DOT`
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calculating fees:', error);
  } finally {
    // Clean up
    await api.disconnect();
  }
}

calculateFees();
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT` with your WebSocket endpoint, `INSERT_ALICE_ADDRESS` with the sender's address, and `INSERT_BOB_ADDRESS` with the recipient's address.

Key aspects of the code:

- **Transaction creation**: The `api.tx.balances.transferKeepAlive()` method constructs a balance transfer transaction.
- **`paymentInfo()`**: Applies a dummy signature and queries the RPC endpoint for fee estimation.
- **Return values**: The `partialFee` property contains the estimated fee in the smallest unit (plancks).

Execute the script using `tsx`:

```bash
npx tsx polkadotjs-fee-calculator.ts
```

You should see output similar to:

<div class="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx polkadotjs-fee-calculator.ts</span>
    <span data-ty="progress"></span>
    <span data-ty>Estimated fee: 0.0014668864 DOT</span>
    <span data-ty>Transaction amount: 1 DOT</span>
    <span data-ty>Total deducted: 1.0014668864 DOT</span>
</div>
## Polkadot.js Apps Interface

For non-programmatic fee inspection, the PolkadotJS Apps interface provides a visual way to estimate transaction fees.

Navigate to the [Polkadot.js Apps interface](https://polkadot.js.org/apps){target=\_blank} and ensure you're connected to the Polkadot relay chain (or your desired network).

### Estimate Fees via Transfer Interface

To see fees before submitting a transfer:

1. Navigate to **Accounts** > **Accounts** in the top menu.
2. Choose an account and click **send**.
3. Fill in the transfer details:
    - **Send to address**: Enter Bob's address.
    - **Amount**: Enter the amount you wish to transfer (e.g., 1 DOT).
4. Click **Sign and Submit**.
5. The transaction fee will be displayed in the confirmation dialog before you sign.

# Chain Data

## Introduction

Understanding and leveraging on-chain data is a fundamental aspect of blockchain development. Whether you're building frontend applications or backend systems, accessing and decoding runtime metadata is vital to interacting with the blockchain. This guide introduces you to the tools and processes for generating and retrieving metadata, explains its role in application development, and outlines the additional APIs available for interacting with a Polkadot node. By mastering these components, you can ensure seamless communication between your applications and the blockchain.

## Application Development

You might not be directly involved in building frontend applications as a blockchain developer. However, most applications that run on a blockchain require some form of frontend or user-facing client to enable users or other programs to access and modify the data that the blockchain stores. For example, you might develop a browser-based, mobile, or desktop application that allows users to submit transactions, post articles, view their assets, or track previous activity. The backend for that application is configured in the runtime logic for your blockchain, but the frontend client makes the runtime features accessible to your users.

For your custom chain to be useful to others, you'll need to provide a client application that allows users to view, interact with, or update information that the blockchain keeps track of. In this article, you'll learn how to expose information about your runtime so that client applications can use it, see examples of the information exposed, and explore tools and libraries that use it.

## Understand Metadata

Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks are designed to expose their runtime information, allowing developers to learn granular details regarding pallets, RPC calls, and runtime APIs. The metadata also exposes their related documentation. The chain's metadata is [SCALE-encoded](/reference/parachains/data-encoding/){target=\_blank}, allowing for the development of browser-based, mobile, or desktop applications to support the chain's runtime upgrades seamlessly. It is also possible to develop applications compatible with multiple Polkadot SDK-based chains simultaneously.

## Expose Runtime Information as Metadata

To interact with a node or the state of the blockchain, you need to know how to connect to the chain and access the exposed runtime features. This interaction involves a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) through a node endpoint address, commonly through a secure web socket connection.

An application developer typically needs to know the contents of the runtime logic, including the following details:

- Version of the runtime the application is connecting to.
- Supported APIs.
- Implemented pallets.
- Defined functions and corresponding type signatures.
- Defined custom types.
- Exposed parameters users can set.

As the Polkadot SDK is modular and provides a composable framework for building blockchains, there are limitless opportunities to customize the schema of properties. Each runtime can be configured with its properties, including function calls and types, which can be changed over time with runtime upgrades.

The Polkadot SDK enables you to generate the runtime metadata schema to capture information unique to a runtime. The metadata for a runtime describes the pallets in use and types defined for a specific runtime version. The metadata includes information about each pallet's storage items, functions, events, errors, and constants. The metadata also provides type definitions for any custom types included in the runtime.

Metadata provides a complete inventory of a chain's runtime. It is key to enabling client applications to interact with the node, parse responses, and correctly format message payloads sent back to that chain.

## Generate Metadata

To efficiently use the blockchain's networking resources and minimize the data transmitted over the network, the metadata schema is encoded using the [Parity SCALE Codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec?tab=readme-ov-file#parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank}. This encoding is done automatically through the [`scale-info`](https://docs.rs/scale-info/latest/scale_info/){target=\_blank}crate.

At a high level, generating the metadata involves the following steps:

1. The pallets in the runtime logic expose callable functions, types, parameters, and documentation that need to be encoded in the metadata.
2. The `scale-info` crate collects type information for the pallets in the runtime, builds a registry of the pallets that exist in a particular runtime, and the relevant types for each pallet in the registry. The type information is detailed enough to enable encoding and decoding for every type.
3. The [`frame-metadata`](https://github.com/paritytech/frame-metadata){target=\_blank} crate describes the structure of the runtime based on the registry provided by the `scale-info` crate.
4. Nodes provide the RPC method `state_getMetadata` to return a complete description of all the types in the current runtime as a hex-encoded vector of SCALE-encoded bytes.

## Retrieve Runtime Metadata

The type information provided by the metadata enables applications to communicate with nodes using different runtime versions and across chains that expose different calls, events, types, and storage items. The metadata also allows libraries to generate a substantial portion of the code needed to communicate with a given node, enabling libraries like [`subxt`](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt){target=\_blank} to generate frontend interfaces that are specific to a target chain.

### Use Polkadot.js

Visit the [Polkadot.js Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/rpc){target=\_blank} and select the **Developer** dropdown in the top banner. Select **RPC Calls** to make the call to request metadata. Follow these steps to make the RPC call:

1. Select **state** as the endpoint to call.
2. Select **`getMetadata(at)`** as the method to call.
3. Click **Submit RPC call** to submit the call and return the metadata in JSON format.

### Use Curl 

You can fetch the metadata for the network by calling the node's RPC endpoint. This request returns the metadata in bytes rather than human-readable JSON:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getMetadata"}' \
https://rpc.polkadot.io

```

### Use Subxt

[`subxt`](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt){target=\_blank} may also be used to fetch the metadata of any data in a human-readable JSON format: 

```sh
subxt metadata  --url wss://rpc.polkadot.io --format json > spec.json
```

Another option is to use the [`subxt` explorer web UI](https://paritytech.github.io/subxt-explorer/#/){target=\_blank}.

## Client Applications and Metadata

The metadata exposes the expected way to decode each type, meaning applications can send, retrieve, and process application information without manual encoding and decoding. Client applications must use the [SCALE codec library](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec?tab=readme-ov-file#parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} to encode and decode RPC payloads to use the metadata. Client applications use the metadata to interact with the node, parse responses, and format message payloads sent to the node.

## Metadata Format

Although the SCALE-encoded bytes can be decoded using the `frame-metadata` and [`parity-scale-codec`](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} libraries, there are other tools, such as `subxt` and the Polkadot-JS API, that can convert the raw data to human-readable JSON format.

The types and type definitions included in the metadata returned by the `state_getMetadata` RPC call depend on the runtime's metadata version.

In general, the metadata includes the following information:

- A constant identifying the file as containing metadata.
- The version of the metadata format used in the runtime.
- Type definitions for all types used in the runtime and generated by the `scale-info` crate.
- Pallet information for the pallets included in the runtime in the order that they are defined in the `construct_runtime` macro.

!!!tip 
    Depending on the frontend library used (such as the [Polkadot API](https://papi.how/){target=\_blank}), they may format the metadata differently than the raw format shown.

The following example illustrates a condensed and annotated section of metadata decoded and converted to JSON:

```json
[
    1635018093,
    {
        "V14": {
            "types": {
                "types": [{}]
            },
            "pallets": [{}],
            "extrinsic": {
                "ty": 126,
                "version": 4,
                "signed_extensions": [{}]
            },
            "ty": 141
        }
    }
]

```

The constant `1635018093` is a magic number that identifies the file as a metadata file. The rest of the metadata is divided into the `types`, `pallets`, and `extrinsic` sections:

- The `types` section contains an index of the types and information about each type's type signature.
- The `pallets` section contains information about each pallet in the runtime.
- The `extrinsic` section describes the type identifier and transaction format version that the runtime uses.

Different extrinsic versions can have varying formats, especially when considering [signed transactions](/reference/parachains/blocks-transactions-fees/transactions/#signed-transactions){target=\_blank}. 

### Pallets

The following is a condensed and annotated example of metadata for a single element in the `pallets` array (the [`sudo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_sudo/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet):

```json
{
    "name": "Sudo",
    "storage": {
        "prefix": "Sudo",
        "entries": [
            {
                "name": "Key",
                "modifier": "Optional",
                "ty": {
                    "Plain": 0
                },
                "default": [0],
                "docs": ["The `AccountId` of the sudo key."]
            }
        ]
    },
    "calls": {
        "ty": 117
    },
    "event": {
        "ty": 42
    },
    "constants": [],
    "error": {
        "ty": 124
    },
    "index": 8
}

```

Every element metadata contains the name of the pallet it represents and information about its storage, calls, events, and errors. You can look up details about the definition of the calls, events, and errors by viewing the type index identifier. The type index identifier is the `u32` integer used to access the type information for that item. For example, the type index identifier for calls in the Sudo pallet is 117. If you view information for that type identifier in the `types` section of the metadata, it provides information about the available calls, including the documentation for each call.

For example, the following is a condensed excerpt of the calls for the Sudo pallet:

```json
{
    "id": 117,
    "type": {
        "path": ["pallet_sudo", "pallet", "Call"],
        "params": [
            {
                "name": "T",
                "type": null
            }
        ],
        "def": {

                        "fields": [
                            {

                                "type": 114,
                                "typeName": "Box<<T as Config>::RuntimeCall>"
                            }
                        ],
                        "index": 0,
                        "docs": [

                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "sudo_unchecked_weight",

                                "typeName": "Box<<T as Config>::RuntimeCall>"
                            },
                            {

                        ]
                    },

                    },
                    {

                                "type": 103,
                                "typeName": "AccountIdLookupOf<T>"
                            },
                            {
                                "name": "call",
                                "type": 114,
                                "typeName": "Box<<T as Config>::RuntimeCall>"
                            }

                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

```

For each field, you can access type information and metadata for the following:

- **Storage metadata**: Provides the information required to enable applications to get information for specific storage items.
- **Call metadata**: Includes information about the runtime calls defined by the `#[pallet]` macro including call names, arguments and documentation.
- **Event metadata**: Provides the metadata generated by the `#[pallet::event]` macro, including the name, arguments, and documentation for each pallet event.
- **Constants metadata**: Provides metadata generated by the `#[pallet::constant]` macro, including the name, type, and hex-encoded value of the constant.
- **Error metadata**: Provides metadata generated by the `#[pallet::error]` macro, including the name and documentation for each pallet error.

!!!tip
    Type identifiers change from time to time, so you should avoid relying on specific type identifiers in your applications.

### Extrinsic

The runtime generates extrinsic metadata and provides useful information about transaction format. When decoded, the metadata contains the transaction version and the list of signed extensions.

For example:

```json
{
    "extrinsic": {
        "ty": 126,
        "version": 4,
        "signed_extensions": [
            {
                "identifier": "CheckNonZeroSender",
                "ty": 132,
                "additional_signed": 41
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckSpecVersion",
                "ty": 133,
                "additional_signed": 4
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckTxVersion",
                "ty": 134,
                "additional_signed": 4
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckGenesis",
                "ty": 135,
                "additional_signed": 11
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckMortality",
                "ty": 136,
                "additional_signed": 11
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckNonce",
                "ty": 138,
                "additional_signed": 41
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckWeight",
                "ty": 139,
                "additional_signed": 41
            },
            {
                "identifier": "ChargeTransactionPayment",
                "ty": 140,
                "additional_signed": 41
            }
        ]
    },
    "ty": 141
}

```

The type system is [composite](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/frame_runtime_types/index.html){target=\_blank}, meaning each type identifier contains a reference to a specific type or to another type identifier that provides information about the associated primitive types.

For example, you can encode the `BitVec<Order, Store>` type, but to decode it properly, you must know the types used for the `Order` and `Store` types. To find type information for `Order` and `Store`, you can use the path in the decoded JSON to locate their type identifiers.

## Included RPC APIs

A standard node comes with the following APIs to interact with a node:

- **[`AuthorApiServer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_rpc/author/trait.AuthorApiServer.html){target=\_blank}**: Make calls into a full node, including authoring extrinsics and verifying session keys.
- **[`ChainApiServer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_rpc/chain/trait.ChainApiServer.html){target=\_blank}**: Retrieve block header and finality information.
- **[`OffchainApiServer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_rpc/offchain/trait.OffchainApiServer.html){target=\_blank}**: Make RPC calls for off-chain workers.
- **[`StateApiServer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_rpc/state/trait.StateApiServer.html){target=\_blank}**: Query information about on-chain state such as runtime version, storage items, and proofs.
- **[`SystemApiServer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_rpc/system/trait.SystemApiServer.html){target=\_blank}**: Retrieve information about network state, such as connected peers and node roles.

# Chopsticks

## Introduction

[Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/){target=\_blank}, developed by the [Acala Foundation](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork){target=\_blank}, is a versatile tool tailored for developers working on Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. With Chopsticks, you can fork live chains locally, replay blocks to analyze extrinsics, and simulate complex scenarios like XCM interactions, all without deploying to a live network.

By streamlining testing and experimentation, Chopsticks empowers developers to innovate and accelerate their blockchain projects within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Key Features

- **Local chain forking**: Fork live Polkadot SDK chains locally for testing and development.
- **Block replay**: Replay specific blocks to analyze state changes and debug extrinsics.
- **XCM testing**: Simulate cross-chain messaging between multiple parachains and relay chains.
- **Storage manipulation**: Override storage values to test specific scenarios.
- **WebSocket commands**: Control the forked environment with specialized RPC methods.
- **Time travel**: Manipulate block timestamps for testing time-dependent logic.
- **Build block modes**: Choose between batch, instant, or manual block production.

!!! warning
    Chopsticks uses [Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=\_blank} light client, which only supports the native Polkadot SDK API. Consequently, a Chopsticks-based fork doesn't support Ethereum JSON-RPC calls, meaning you cannot use it to fork your chain and connect Metamask.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank}
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, which should be installed with Node.js by default, or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}

## Installation

You can install Chopsticks globally or locally in your project. Choose the option that best fits your development workflow. 

!!! tip
    This documentation explains the features of Chopsticks version `1.2.2`. Make sure you're using the correct version to match these instructions.

    ```

Finally, you can run Chopsticks using the `npx` command. To see all available options and commands, run it with the `--help` flag:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks --help
```

## Get Started

### Configuration Options

To run Chopsticks, you need to configure some parameters. This can be set either via a configuration file or the command-line interface (CLI). The parameters that can be configured are as follows:

- **`genesis`**: The link to a parachain's raw genesis file to build the fork from, instead of an endpoint.
- **`timestamp`**: Timestamp of the block to fork from.
- **`endpoint`**: The endpoint of the parachain to fork.
- **`block`**: Use to specify at which block hash or number to replay the fork.
- **`wasm-override`**: Path of the Wasm to use as the parachain runtime, instead of an endpoint's runtime.
- **`db`**: Path to the name of the file that stores or will store the parachain's database.
- **`config`**: Path or URL of the config file.
- **`port`**: The port to expose an endpoint on.
- **`build-block-mode`**: How blocks should be built in the fork: batch, manual, instant.
- **`import-storage`**: A pre-defined JSON/YAML storage path to override in the parachain's storage.
- **`allow-unresolved-imports`**: Whether to allow Wasm unresolved imports when using a Wasm to build the parachain.
- **`html`**: Include to generate storage diff preview between blocks.
- **`mock-signature-host`**: Mock signature host so that any signature starts with `0xdeadbeef` and filled by `0xcd` is considered valid.

### Configuration File

The Chopsticks source repository includes a collection of [YAML](https://yaml.org/){target=\_blank} files that can be used to set up various Polkadot SDK chains locally. You can download these configuration files from the [repository's `configs` folder](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/tree/master/configs){target=\_blank}.

An example of a configuration file for Polkadot is as follows:

{% raw %}
```yaml title="polkadot.yml"
endpoint:
  - wss://rpc.ibp.network/polkadot
  - wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com
mock-signature-host: true
block: ${env.POLKADOT_BLOCK_NUMBER}
db: ./db.sqlite
runtime-log-level: 5

```
{% endraw %}

The configuration file allows you to modify the storage of the forked network by rewriting the pallet, state component, and value that you want to change. For example, Polkadot's file rewrites Alice's `system.Account` storage so that the free balance is set to `10000000000000000000`.

### Create a Fork

To run Chopsticks using a configuration file, utilize the `--config` flag. You can use a raw GitHub URL, a path to a local file, or simply the chain's name:

=== "Chain Name"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=polkadot
    ```

=== "GitHub URL"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
    --config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

=== "Local File Path"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

Alternatively, you can create a fork using CLI flags. For example, to fork Polkadot at block 100:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
--endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com \
--block 100
```

If the fork is successful, you will see output indicating the RPC is listening:

<div class="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input">npx @acala-network/chopsticks --endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com --block 100</span>
    <span data-ty="output">[19:12:21.023] INFO: Polkadot RPC listening on port 8000</span>
</div>
You can now access the running Chopsticks fork using the default address: `ws://localhost:8000`.

### Interact with a Fork

You can interact with the forked chain using various libraries such as [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/){target=\_blank}.

=== "Via Polkadot.js Apps"

    To interact with Chopsticks via the hosted user interface, visit [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} and follow these steps:

    1. Select the network icon in the top left corner.

        ![](/images/reference/tools/chopsticks/chopsticks-1.webp)

    2. Scroll to the bottom and select **Development**.
    3. Choose **Custom**.
    4. Enter `ws://localhost:8000` in the input field.
    5. Select the **Switch** button.

        ![](/images/reference/tools/chopsticks/chopsticks-2.webp)

    You should now be connected to your local fork and can interact with it as you would with a real chain.

=== "Via Polkadot.js API"

    For programmatic interaction, you can use the [Polkadot.js](/reference/tools/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank} library:

    ```typescript title="connect-to-fork.ts"
    import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

    async function connectToFork() {
      const wsProvider = new WsProvider('ws://localhost:8000');
      const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });
      await api.isReady;

      // Now you can use 'api' to interact with your fork
      console.log(`Connected to chain: ${await api.rpc.system.chain()}`);
    }

    connectToFork();

    ```

### Replay Blocks

Chopsticks lets you replay specific blocks in a chain, which is useful for debugging and analyzing state changes. Use the `run-block` subcommand with the following options:

- **`output-path`**: Path to print output.
- **`html`**: Generate HTML with storage diff.
- **`open`**: Open generated HTML.

For example, to replay block 1000 from Polkadot and save the output to a JSON file:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks run-block \
--endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com \
--output-path ./polkadot-output.json \
--block 1000
```

The output will include detailed information about the block execution, storage changes, and runtime logs.

### Test XCM

To test XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) messages between networks, you can fork multiple parachains and a relay chain locally using Chopsticks.

Use the `xcm` subcommand with:

- **`-r` / `--relaychain`**: Relay chain config file
- **`-p` / `--parachain`**: Parachain config file (can be specified multiple times)

For example, to fork Moonbeam, Astar, and Polkadot, enabling XCM between them:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks xcm \
--r polkadot \
--p moonbeam \
--p astar
```

After running it, you should see output indicating connections between the chains:

<div class="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input">npx @acala-network/chopsticks xcm --r polkadot --p moonbeam --p astar</span>
    <span data-ty="output">[13:46:12.631] INFO: Moonbeam RPC listening on port 8000</span>
    <span data-ty="output">[13:46:23.669] INFO: Astar RPC listening on port 8001</span>
    <span data-ty="output">[13:46:53.320] INFO: Polkadot RPC listening on port 8002</span>
    <span data-ty="output">[13:46:54.038] INFO (xcm): Connected relaychain 'Polkadot' with parachain 'Moonbeam'</span>
    <span data-ty="output">[13:46:55.028] INFO (xcm): Connected relaychain 'Polkadot' with parachain 'Astar'</span>
</div>
Now you can interact with your forked chains using the ports specified in the output and test XCM messages between them.

Page Title: Contract Deployment

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-for-eth-devs-contract-deployment.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/for-eth-devs/contract-deployment/
- Summary: Compare deployment flows for REVM and PVM-based smart contracts on the Polkadot Hub. Includes single-step REVM flows and PVM’s two-step deployment model.

# Contract Deployment

## Introduction

Polkadot's smart contract platform supports two distinct virtual machine backends: Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine (REVM) and PolkaVM. Each backend has its own deployment characteristics and optimization strategies. REVM provides full Ethereum compatibility with familiar single-step deployment, while the RISC-V-based PolkaVM uses a more structured two-step approach optimized for its architecture. Understanding these differences ensures smooth deployment regardless of which backend you choose for your smart contracts.

## REVM Deployment

The REVM backend enables seamless deployment of Ethereum contracts without modification. Contracts deploy exactly as they would on Ethereum, using familiar tools and workflows.

With REVM, deployment mirrors the Ethereum flow exactly including: 

- Contracts are bundled and deployed in a single transaction. 
- Factory contracts can create new contracts at runtime.
- Runtime code generation, including inline assembly, is supported.
- Existing familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix work out of the box.

## PolkaVM Deployment

PolkaVM implements a fundamentally different deployment model optimized for its RISC-V architecture. While simple contract deployments work seamlessly, advanced patterns like factory contracts require understanding the two-step deployment process.

### Standard Contract Deployment

For most use cases, such as deploying ERC-20 tokens, NFT collections, or standalone contracts, deployment is transparent and requires no special steps. The [Revive compiler](https://github.com/paritytech/revive){target=\_blank} handles the deployment process automatically when using standard Solidity patterns.

### Two-Step Deployment Model

PolkaVM separates contract deployment into distinct phases:

1. **Code upload**: Contract bytecode must be uploaded to the chain before instantiation.
2. **Contract instantiation**: Contracts are created by referencing previously uploaded code via its hash.

This architecture differs from the EVM's bundled approach and has important implications for specific deployment patterns.

### Factory Pattern Considerations

The common EVM pattern, where contracts dynamically create other contracts, requires adaptation for PolkaVM as follows:

**EVM Factory Pattern:**
```solidity
// This works on REVM but requires modification for PolkaVM
contract Factory {
    function createToken() public returns (address) {
        // EVM bundles bytecode in the factory
        return address(new Token());
    }
}
```

**PolkaVM Requirements:**

- **Pre-upload dependent contracts**: All contracts that will be instantiated at runtime must be uploaded to the chain before the factory attempts to create them.
- **Code hash references**: Factory contracts work with pre-uploaded code hashes rather than embedding bytecode.
- **No runtime code generation**: Dynamic bytecode generation is not supported due to PolkaVM's RISC-V format.

### Migration Strategy for Factory Contracts

When migrating factory contracts from Ethereum to PolkaVM:

1. **Identify all contracts**: Determine which contracts will be instantiated at runtime.
2. **Upload dependencies first**: Deploy all dependent contracts to the chain before deploying the factory.
3. **Use on-chain constructors**: Leverage PolkaVM's on-chain constructor feature for flexible instantiation.
4. **Avoid assembly creation**: Don't use `create` or `create2` opcodes in assembly blocks for manual deployment.

### Architecture-Specific Limitations

PolkaVM's deployment model creates several specific constraints:

- **`EXTCODECOPY` limitations**: Contracts using `EXTCODECOPY` to manipulate code at runtime will encounter issues.
- **Runtime code modification**: Patterns that construct and mutate contract code on-the-fly are not supported.
- **Assembly-based factories**: Factory contracts written in YUL assembly that generate code at runtime will fail with `CodeNotFound` errors.

These patterns are rare in practice and typically require dropping down to assembly, making them non-issues for standard Solidity development.

### On-Chain Constructors

PolkaVM provides on-chain constructors as an elegant alternative to runtime code modification:

- Enable contract instantiation without runtime code generation.
- Support flexible initialization patterns.
- Maintain separation between code upload and contract creation.
- Provide predictable deployment costs.

## Gas Estimation vs Actual Consumption

Both REVM and PolkaVM deployments may show significant differences between gas estimation and actual consumption. You might see estimates that are several times higher than the actual gas consumed (often around 30% of the estimate). This is normal behavior because pre-dispatch estimation cannot distinguish between computation weight and storage deposits, leading to conservative overestimation. Contract deployments are particularly affected as they consume significant storage deposits for code storage.

## Deployment Comparison

| Feature | REVM Backend | PolkaVM Backend |
|:-------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|
| **Deployment Model** | Single-step bundled | Two-step upload and instantiate |
| **Factory Patterns** | Direct runtime creation | Requires pre-uploaded code |
| **Code Bundling** | Bytecode in transaction | Code hash references |
| **Runtime Codegen** | Fully supported | Not supported |
| **Simple Contracts** | No modifications needed | No modifications needed |
| **Assembly Creation** | Supported | Discouraged, limited support |

## Conclusion

Both backends support contract deployment effectively, with REVM offering drop-in Ethereum compatibility and PolkaVM providing a more structured two-step approach. For the majority of use cases—deploying standard contracts like tokens or applications—both backends work seamlessly. Advanced patterns like factory contracts may require adjustment for PolkaVM, but these adaptations are straightforward with proper planning.

Page Title: Create an Account

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/chain-interactions-accounts-create-account.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/chain-interactions/accounts/create-account/
- Summary: Step-by-step guide to creating Polkadot accounts using different programming languages and libraries, including JavaScript, Python, and Rust examples.

# Create an Account

## Introduction

Creating accounts is a fundamental operation when building applications on Polkadot and its parachains. Accounts serve as the basis for identity, asset ownership, and transaction signing. Understanding how to generate and manage accounts programmatically enables you to build wallets, automate operations, and create seamless user experiences.

Polkadot accounts are based on the SR25519 signature scheme by default, though ED25519 and ECDSA are also supported. Each account consists of a public key (address) and a private key (seed/mnemonic). **Keep your private keys secure and never share them**.

This tutorial will guide you through creating accounts using different programming languages and libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Basic understanding of public-key cryptography concepts
- Development environment set up for your chosen language
- Familiarity with the programming language you'll be using

## Use JavaScript/TypeScript

JavaScript/TypeScript developers can use the Polkadot.js API to create and manage Polkadot accounts.

1. Create a new project directory and initialize it:

    ```bash
    mkdir account-creator
    cd account-creator
    npm init -y && npm pkg set type=module
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install @polkadot/util-crypto @polkadot/keyring
    npm install --save-dev typescript tsx
    ```

3. Create a file named `create-account.ts` and add the following code to it:

    ```typescript title="create-account.ts"
    import { cryptoWaitReady, mnemonicGenerate } from '@polkadot/util-crypto';
    import { Keyring } from '@polkadot/keyring';

    async function main() {
      await cryptoWaitReady();

      const mnemonic = mnemonicGenerate(12);
      const keyring = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519', ss58Format: 0 });
      const pair = keyring.addFromMnemonic(mnemonic);

      console.log(`Address: ${pair.address}`);
      console.log(`Mnemonic: ${mnemonic}`);
    }

    main().catch(console.error);

    ```

    Key aspects of the code:

    - **Mnemonic generation**: Uses `mnemonicGenerate()` to create a 12-word BIP39 mnemonic phrase for human-readable key backup.
    - **Keyring**: The `Keyring` class manages accounts with a specified signature scheme and address format.
    - **SS58 format**: Setting `ss58Format: 0` configures addresses for the Polkadot relay chain.

4. Execute the script using `tsx`:

    ```bash
    npx tsx create-account.ts
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    <div class="termynal" data-termynal>
        <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx create-account.ts</span>
        <span data-ty="progress"></span>
        <span data-ty>Address: 15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5</span>
        <span data-ty>Mnemonic: cushion dog echo people vendor curve truck begin latin romance rebuild ...</span>
    </div>
## Python

Python developers can use the `substrate-interface` library to create and manage Polkadot accounts.

1. Create a new project directory and set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    mkdir account-creator-python
    cd account-creator-python
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Install the required package:

    ```bash
    pip install substrate-interface
    ```

3. Create a file named `create_account.py`:

    ```python title="create_account.py"
    from substrateinterface import Keypair

    mnemonic = Keypair.generate_mnemonic()
    keypair = Keypair.create_from_mnemonic(mnemonic)

    print(f"Address: {keypair.ss58_address}")
    print(f"Mnemonic: {mnemonic}")

    ```

    Key aspects of the code:

    - **Mnemonic generation**: The `generate_mnemonic()` function creates a BIP39-compatible phrase.
    - **Keypair creation**: `Keypair.create_from_mnemonic()` derives keys from the mnemonic.

4. Execute the script:

    ```bash
    python create_account.py
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    <div class="termynal" data-termynal>
        <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>python create_account.py</span>
        <span data-ty>Address: 15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5</span>
        <span data-ty>Mnemonic: cushion dog echo people vendor curve truck begin latin romance rebuild ...</span>
    </div>
## Rust

Rust provides low-level access to Substrate primitives for account creation through the `sp-core` and `sp-keyring` crates.

1. Create a new Rust project:

    ```bash
    cargo new account-creator-rust
    cd account-creator-rust
    ```

2. Add dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
    [package]
    name = "account-creator-rust"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2021"

    [dependencies]
    sp-core = "28.0"
    sp-runtime = "31.0"
    ```

3. Create your account generation code in `src/main.rs`:

    ```rust title="src/main.rs"
    use sp_core::{crypto::Ss58Codec, Pair};

    fn main() {
        let (pair, phrase, _) = sp_core::sr25519::Pair::generate_with_phrase(None);
        let address = pair.public().to_ss58check();
        
        println!("Address: {}", address);
        println!("Mnemonic: {}", phrase);
    }
    ```

    Key aspects of the code:

    - **Keypair generation**: [`sr25519::Pair::generate_with_phrase()`](https://docs.rs/sp-core/latest/sp_core/crypto/trait.Pair.html#method.generate_with_phrase){target=\_blank} creates a new key pair with mnemonic.
    - **Public key extraction**: The [`public()`](https://docs.rs/sp-core/latest/sp_core/crypto/trait.Pair.html#tymethod.public){target=\_blank} method retrieves the public key from the pair.
    - **SS58 encoding**: Uses Polkadot's address format for the human-readable address.

4. Build and run the project:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    <div class="termynal" data-termynal>
        <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>cargo run</span>
        <span data-ty>Address: 15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5</span>
        <span data-ty>Mnemonic: cushion dog echo people vendor curve truck begin latin romance rebuild ...</span>

# Cryptography

## Introduction

Cryptography forms the backbone of blockchain technology, providing the mathematical verifiability crucial for consensus systems, data integrity, and user security. While a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical processes isn't necessary for most blockchain developers, grasping the fundamental applications of cryptography is essential. This page comprehensively overviews cryptographic implementations used across Polkadot SDK-based chains and the broader blockchain ecosystem.

## Hash Functions

Hash functions are fundamental to blockchain technology, creating a unique digital fingerprint for any piece of data, including simple text, images, or any other form of file. They map input data of any size to a fixed-size output (typically 32 bytes) using complex mathematical operations. Hashing is used to verify data integrity, create digital signatures, and provide a secure way to store passwords. This form of mapping is known as the ["pigeonhole principle,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle){target=\_blank} it is primarily implemented to efficiently and verifiably identify data from large sets.

### Key Properties of Hash Functions

- **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same output.
- **Quick computation**: It's easy to calculate the hash value for any given input.
- **Pre-image resistance**: It's infeasible to generate the input data from its hash.
- **Small changes in input yield large changes in output**: Known as the ["avalanche effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect){target=\_blank}.
- **Collision resistance**: The probabilities are extremely low to find two different inputs with the same hash.

### Blake2

The Polkadot SDK utilizes Blake2, a state-of-the-art hashing method that offers:

- Equal or greater security compared to [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2){target=\_blank}.
- Significantly faster performance than other algorithms.

These properties make Blake2 ideal for blockchain systems, reducing sync times for new nodes and lowering the resources required for validation. For detailed technical specifications about Blake2, see the [official Blake2 paper](https://www.blake2.net/blake2.pdf){target=\_blank}.

## Types of Cryptography

There are two different ways that cryptographic algorithms are implemented: symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography.

### Symmetric Cryptography

Symmetric encryption is a branch of cryptography that isn't based on one-way functions, unlike asymmetric cryptography. It uses the same cryptographic key to encrypt plain text and decrypt the resulting ciphertext.

Symmetric cryptography is a type of encryption that has been used throughout history, such as the Enigma Cipher and the Caesar Cipher. It is still widely used today and can be found in Web2 and Web3 applications alike. There is only one single key, and a recipient must also have access to it to access the contained information.

#### Advantages {: #symmetric-advantages }

- Fast and efficient for large amounts of data.
- Requires less computational power.

#### Disadvantages {: #symmetric-disadvantages }

- Key distribution can be challenging.
- Scalability issues in systems with many users.

### Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric encryption is a type of cryptography that uses two different keys, known as a keypair: a public key, used to encrypt plain text, and a private counterpart, used to decrypt the ciphertext.

The public key encrypts a fixed-length message that can only be decrypted with the recipient's private key and, sometimes, a set password. The public key can be used to cryptographically verify that the corresponding private key was used to create a piece of data without compromising the private key, such as with digital signatures. This has obvious implications for identity, ownership, and properties and is used in many different protocols across Web2 and Web3.

#### Advantages {: #asymmetric-advantages }

- Solves the key distribution problem.
- Enables digital signatures and secure key exchange.

#### Disadvantages {: #asymmetric-disadvantages }

- Slower than symmetric encryption.
- Requires more computational resources.

### Trade-offs and Compromises

Symmetric cryptography is faster and requires fewer bits in the key to achieve the same level of security that asymmetric cryptography provides. However, it requires a shared secret before communication can occur, which poses issues to its integrity and a potential compromise point. On the other hand, asymmetric cryptography doesn't require the secret to be shared ahead of time, allowing for far better end-user security.

Hybrid symmetric and asymmetric cryptography is often used to overcome the engineering issues of asymmetric cryptography, as it is slower and requires more bits in the key to achieve the same level of security. It encrypts a key and then uses the comparatively lightweight symmetric cipher to do the "heavy lifting" with the message.

## Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are a way of verifying the authenticity of a document or message using asymmetric keypairs. They are used to ensure that a sender or signer's document or message hasn't been tampered with in transit, and for recipients to verify that the data is accurate and from the expected sender.

Signing digital signatures only requires a low-level understanding of mathematics and cryptography. For a conceptual example -- when signing a check, it is expected that it cannot be cashed multiple times. This isn't a feature of the signature system but rather the check serialization system. The bank will check that the serial number on the check hasn't already been used. Digital signatures essentially combine these two concepts, allowing the signature to provide the serialization via a unique cryptographic fingerprint that cannot be reproduced.

Unlike pen-and-paper signatures, knowledge of a digital signature cannot be used to create other signatures. Digital signatures are often used in bureaucratic processes, as they are more secure than simply scanning in a signature and pasting it onto a document.

Polkadot SDK provides multiple different cryptographic schemes and is generic so that it can support anything that implements the [`Pair` trait](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_core/crypto/trait.Pair.html){target=\_blank}.

### Example of Creating a Digital Signature

The process of creating and verifying a digital signature involves several steps:

1. The sender creates a hash of the message.
2. The hash is encrypted using the sender's private key, creating the signature.
3. The message and signature are sent to the recipient.
4. The recipient decrypts the signature using the sender's public key.
5. The recipient hashes the received message and compares it to the decrypted hash.

If the hashes match, the signature is valid, confirming the message's integrity and the sender's identity.

## Elliptic Curve

Blockchain technology requires the ability to have multiple keys creating a signature for block proposal and validation. To this end, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr signatures are two of the most commonly used methods. While ECDSA is a far simpler implementation, Schnorr signatures are more efficient when it comes to multi-signatures.

Schnorr signatures bring some noticeable features over the ECDSA/EdDSA schemes:

- It is better for hierarchical deterministic key derivations.
- It allows for native multi-signature through [signature aggregation](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/schnorr-signature-aggregation/){target=\_blank}.
- It is generally more resistant to misuse.

One sacrifice that is made when using Schnorr signatures over ECDSA is that both require 64 bytes, but only ECDSA signatures communicate their public key.

### Various Implementations

- **[ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm){target=\_blank}**: Polkadot SDK provides an ECDSA signature scheme using the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1){target=\_blank} curve. This is the same cryptographic algorithm used to secure [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin){target=\_blank} and [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum){target=\_blank}.

- **[Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519){target=\_blank}**: An EdDSA signature scheme using [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519){target=\_blank}. It is carefully engineered at several levels of design and implementation to achieve very high speeds without compromising security.

- **[SR25519](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/keys/accounts-more){target=\_blank}**: Based on the same underlying curve as Ed25519. However, it uses Schnorr signatures instead of the EdDSA scheme.

# Data Encoding

## Introduction

The Polkadot SDK uses a lightweight and efficient encoding/decoding mechanism to optimize data transmission across the network. This mechanism, known as the _SCALE_ codec, is used for serializing and deserializing data.

The SCALE codec enables communication between the runtime and the outer node. This mechanism is designed for high-performance, copy-free data encoding and decoding in resource-constrained environments like the Polkadot SDK [Wasm runtime](/develop/parachains/deployment/build-deterministic-runtime/#introduction){target=\_blank}.

It is not self-describing, meaning the decoding context must fully know the encoded data types. 

Parity's libraries utilize the [`parity-scale-codec`](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} crate (a Rust implementation of the SCALE codec) to handle encoding and decoding for interactions between RPCs and the runtime.

The `codec` mechanism is ideal for Polkadot SDK-based chains because:

- It is lightweight compared to generic serialization frameworks like [`serde`](https://serde.rs/){target=\_blank}, which add unnecessary bulk to binaries.
- It doesn’t rely on Rust’s `libstd`, making it compatible with `no_std` environments like Wasm runtime.
- It integrates seamlessly with Rust, allowing easy derivation of encoding and decoding logic for new types using `#[derive(Encode, Decode)]`.

Defining a custom encoding scheme in the Polkadot SDK-based chains, rather than using an existing Rust codec library, is crucial for enabling cross-platform and multi-language support. 

## SCALE Codec

The codec is implemented using the following traits:

- [`Encode`](#encode)
- [`Decode`](#decode)
- [`CompactAs`](#compactas)
- [`HasCompact`](#hascompact)
- [`EncodeLike`](#encodelike)

### Encode

The [`Encode`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.Encode.html){target=\_blank} trait handles data encoding into SCALE format and includes the following key functions:

- **`size_hint(&self) -> usize`**: Estimates the number of bytes required for encoding to prevent multiple memory allocations. This should be inexpensive and avoid complex operations. Optional if the size isn’t known.
- **`encode_to<T: Output>(&self, dest: &mut T)`**: Encodes the data, appending it to a destination buffer.
- **`encode(&self) -> Vec<u8>`**: Encodes the data and returns it as a byte vector.
- **`using_encoded<R, F: FnOnce(&[u8]) -> R>(&self, f: F) -> R`**: Encodes the data and passes it to a closure, returning the result.
- **`encoded_size(&self) -> usize`**: Calculates the encoded size. Should be used when the encoded data isn’t required.

!!!tip
    For best performance, value types should override `using_encoded`, and allocating types should override `encode_to`. It's recommended to implement `size_hint` for all types where possible.

### Decode

The [`Decode`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.Decode.html){target=\_blank} trait handles decoding SCALE-encoded data back into the appropriate types:

- **`fn decode<I: Input>(value: &mut I) -> Result<Self, Error>`**: Decodes data from the SCALE format, returning an error if decoding fails.

### CompactAs

The [`CompactAs`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.CompactAs.html){target=\_blank} trait wraps custom types for compact encoding:

- **`encode_as(&self) -> &Self::As`**: Encodes the type as a compact type.
- **`decode_from(_: Self::As) -> Result<Self, Error>`**: decodes from a compact encoded type.

### HasCompact

The [`HasCompact`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.HasCompact.html){target=\_blank} trait indicates a type supports compact encoding.

### EncodeLike

The [`EncodeLike`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.EncodeLike.html){target=\_blank} trait is used to ensure multiple types that encode similarly are accepted by the same function. When using `derive`, it is automatically implemented.

### Data Types

The table below outlines how the Rust implementation of the Parity SCALE codec encodes different data types.

## Encode and Decode Rust Trait Implementations

Here's how the `Encode` and `Decode` traits are implemented:


```rust
use parity_scale_codec::{Encode, Decode};

[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Encode, Decode)]
enum EnumType {
    #[codec(index = 15)]
    A,
    B(u32, u64),
    C {
        a: u32,
        b: u64,
    },
}

let a = EnumType::A;
let b = EnumType::B(1, 2);
let c = EnumType::C { a: 1, b: 2 };

a.using_encoded(|ref slice| {
    assert_eq!(slice, &b"\x0f");
});

b.using_encoded(|ref slice| {
    assert_eq!(slice, &b"\x01\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0");
});

c.using_encoded(|ref slice| {
    assert_eq!(slice, &b"\x02\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0");
});

let mut da: &[u8] = b"\x0f";
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut da).ok(), Some(a));

let mut db: &[u8] = b"\x01\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0";
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut db).ok(), Some(b));

let mut dc: &[u8] = b"\x02\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0";
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut dc).ok(), Some(c));

let mut dz: &[u8] = &[0];
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut dz).ok(), None);
```

- **Fully typed API**: Comprehensive TypeScript support for seamless on-chain interaction and ink! smart contract integration.
- **Multi-version JSON-RPC support**: Compatible with both [legacy](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/blob/master/PSPs/drafts/psp-6.md){target=\_blank} and [new](https://paritytech.github.io/json-rpc-interface-spec/introduction.html){target=\_blank} JSON-RPC APIs for broad ecosystem interoperability.
- **Light client support**: Designed to work with light clients such as [Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=\_blank}.
- **Native TypeScript for scale codec**: Implements scale codec parsing directly in TypeScript without relying on custom wrappers.
- **Wallet integration**: Works out-of-the-box with [@polkadot/extension-based](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension?tab=readme-ov-file#api-interface){target=\_blank} wallets.
- **Familiar API design**: Similar API style to Polkadot.js for easy and fast migration.

## Installation

To add Dedot to your project, use the following command:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm i dedot
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm add dedot
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add dedot
    ```

To enable auto-completion/IntelliSense for individual chains, install the [`@dedot/chaintypes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dedot/chaintypes){target=\_blank} package as a development dependency:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm i -D @dedot/chaintypes
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm add -D @dedot/chaintypes
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add -D @dedot/chaintypes
    ```

## Get Started

### Initialize a Client Instance

To connect to and interact with different networks, Dedot provides two client options depending on your needs:

- **[`DedotClient`](https://docs.dedot.dev/clients-and-providers/clients#dedotclient){target=\_blank}**: Interacts with chains via the [new JSON-RPC APIs](https://paritytech.github.io/json-rpc-interface-spec/introduction.html){target=\_blank}.
- **[`LegacyClient`](https://docs.dedot.dev/clients-and-providers/clients#legacyclient){target=\_blank}**: Interacts with chains via the [legacy JSON-RPC APIs](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/blob/master/PSPs/drafts/psp-6.md){target=\_blank}.

Use the following snippets to connect to Polkadot using `DedotClient`:

=== "WebSocket"

    ```typescript
    import { DedotClient, WsProvider } from 'dedot';
    import type { PolkadotApi } from '@dedot/chaintypes';

    // Initialize providers & clients
    const provider = new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io');
    const client = await DedotClient.new<PolkadotApi>(provider);

    ```

=== "Light Client (Smoldot)"

    ```typescript
    import { DedotClient, SmoldotProvider } from 'dedot';
    import type { PolkadotApi } from '@dedot/chaintypes';
    import * as smoldot from 'smoldot';

    // import `polkadot` chain spec to connect to Polkadot
    import { polkadot } from '@substrate/connect-known-chains';

    // Start smoldot instance & initialize a chain
    const client = smoldot.start();
    const chain = await client.addChain({ chainSpec: polkadot });

    // Initialize providers & clients
    const provider = new SmoldotProvider(chain);
    const client = await DedotClient.new<PolkadotApi>(provider);

    ```

If the node doesn't support new JSON-RPC APIs yet, you can connect to the network using the `LegacyClient`, which is built on top of the legacy JSON-RPC APIs.

```typescript
import { LegacyClient, WsProvider } from 'dedot';
import type { PolkadotApi } from '@dedot/chaintypes';

const provider = new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io');
const client = await LegacyClient.new<PolkadotApi>(provider);

```

### Enable Type and API Suggestions

It is recommended to specify the `ChainApi` interface (e.g., `PolkadotApi` in the example in the previous section) of the chain you want to interact with. This enables type and API suggestions/autocompletion for that particular chain (via IntelliSense). If you don't specify a `ChainApi` interface, a default `SubstrateApi` interface will be used.

```typescript
import { DedotClient, WsProvider } from 'dedot';
import type { PolkadotApi, KusamaApi } from '@dedot/chaintypes';

const polkadotClient = await DedotClient.new<PolkadotApi>(
  new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io')
);
const kusamaClient = await DedotClient.new<KusamaApi>(
  new WsProvider('wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io')
);
const genericClient = await DedotClient.new(
  new WsProvider('ws://localhost:9944')
);

```

If you don't find the `ChainApi` for the network you're working with in [the list](https://github.com/dedotdev/chaintypes?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-networks){target=\_blank}, you can generate the `ChainApi` (types and APIs) using the built-in [`dedot` cli](https://docs.dedot.dev/cli){target=\_blank}.

```bash
# Generate ChainApi interface for Polkadot network via rpc endpoint: wss://rpc.polkadot.io
npx dedot chaintypes -w wss://rpc.polkadot.io
```

Or open a pull request to add your favorite network to the [`@dedot/chaintypes`](https://github.com/dedotdev/chaintypes){target=\_blank} repo.

### Read On-Chain Data

Dedot provides several ways to read data from the chain:

- **Access runtime constants**: Use the syntax `client.consts.<pallet>.<constantName>` to inspect runtime constants (parameter types).

    ```typescript
    const ss58Prefix = client.consts.system.ss58Prefix;
    console.log('Polkadot ss58Prefix:', ss58Prefix);

    ```

- **Storage queries**: Use the syntax `client.query.<pallet>.<storgeEntry>` to query on-chain storage.

    ```typescript
    const balance = await client.query.system.account('INSERT_ADDRESS');
    console.log('Balance:', balance.data.free);

    ```

- **Subscribe to storage changes**:

    ```typescript
    const unsub = await client.query.system.number((blockNumber) => {
      console.log(`Current block number: ${blockNumber}`);
    });

    ```

- **Call Runtime APIs**: Use the syntax `client.call.<runtimeApi>.<methodName>` to execute Runtime APIs.

    ```typescript
    const metadata = await client.call.metadata.metadataAtVersion(15);
    console.log('Metadata V15', metadata);

    ```

- **Watch on-chain events**: Use the syntax `client.events.<pallet>.<eventName>` to access pallet events.
    
    ```typescript
    const unsub = await client.events.system.NewAccount.watch((events) => {
      console.log('New Account Created', events);
    });

    ```

### Sign and Send Transactions

Sign the transaction using `IKeyringPair` from Keyring ([`@polkadot/keyring`](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/keyring/start/sign-verify/){target=\_blank}) and send the transaction.

```typescript
import { cryptoWaitReady } from '@polkadot/util-crypto';
import { Keyring } from '@polkadot/keyring';
// Setup keyring
await cryptoWaitReady();
const keyring = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' });
const alice = keyring.addFromUri('//Alice');
// Send transaction
const unsub = await client.tx.balances
  .transferKeepAlive('INSERT_DEST_ADDRESS', 2_000_000_000_000n)
  .signAndSend(alice, async ({ status }) => {
    console.log('Transaction status', status.type);
    if (status.type === 'BestChainBlockIncluded') {
      console.log(`Transaction is included in best block`);
    }
    if (status.type === 'Finalized') {
      console.log(
        `Transaction completed at block hash ${status.value.blockHash}`
      );
      await unsub();
    }
  });

```

You can also use `Signer` from wallet extensions:

```typescript
const injected = await window.injectedWeb3['polkadot-js'].enable('My dApp');
const account = (await injected.accounts.get())[0];
const signer = injected.signer;
const unsub = await client.tx.balances
  .transferKeepAlive('INSERT_DEST_ADDRESS', 2_000_000_000_000n)
  .signAndSend(account.address, { signer }, async ({ status }) => {
    console.log('Transaction status', status.type);
    if (status.type === 'BestChainBlockIncluded') {
      console.log(`Transaction is included in best block`);
    }
    if (status.type === 'Finalized') {
      console.log(
        `Transaction completed at block hash ${status.value.blockHash}`
      );
      await unsub();
    }
  });

```

Page Title: Deploy an ERC-20 Using Hardhat

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-cookbook-smart-contracts-deploy-erc20-erc20-hardhat.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-hardhat/
- Summary: Deploy an ERC-20 token on Polkadot Hub using PolkaVM. This guide covers contract creation, compilation, deployment, and interaction via Hardhat.

# Deploy an ERC-20 Using Hardhat

## Introduction

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank} tokens are fungible tokens commonly used for creating cryptocurrencies, governance tokens, and staking mechanisms. Polkadot Hub enables easy deployment of ERC-20 tokens via Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and tools.

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an ERC-20 contract on Polkadot Hub TestNet using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank}, an Ethereum development environment. The ERC-20 contract can be retrieved from OpenZeppelin's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.4.0/contracts/token/ERC20){target=\_blank} or their [Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} programming and [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/){target=\_blank} fungible tokens.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\_blank} v22.13.1 or later installed.
- Test tokens for gas fees, available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. See [Get Test Tokens](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank} for a guide to using the faucet.
- A wallet with a private key for signing transactions.

## Set Up Your Project

This tutorial uses a [Hardhat ERC-20 template](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/tree/master/erc20-hardhat){target=\_blank} that contains all the necessary files. 

To get started, take the following steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/
    cd revm-hardhat-examples/erc20-hardhat
    ```

2. Install the dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
    
    This command will fetch all the necessary packages to help you use Hardhat to deploy an ERC-20 to Polkadot.

## Configure Hardhat

If you started with the cloned Hardhat ERC-20 template, `hardhat.config.ts` is already configured to deploy to the Polkadot TestNet as shown in the example below:

```ts title="hardhat.config.ts" hl_lines="14-19"

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.28",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200,
      },
    },
  },
  networks: {
    polkadotTestnet: {
      url: vars.get("TESTNET_URL", "http://127.0.0.1:8545"),
      accounts: vars.has("TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY") ? [vars.get("TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY")] : [],
    },
  },
  mocha: {
    timeout: 40000,
  },
};

export default config;
```

!!! tip
    Visit the Hardhat [Configuration variables](https://v2.hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables){target=\_blank} documentation to learn how to use Hardhat to handle your private keys securely.

## Compile the Contract 

Next, compile the contract included with the template by running the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

If everything compiles successfully, you will see output similar to the following:


## Test the Contract

You can view the predefined test file at [`test/MyToken.test.ts`](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/blob/master/erc20-hardhat/test/MyToken.test.ts){target=\_blank}. This example test includes verification of the following:

- The token name and symbol exist (confirms deployment) and are correct.
- The token owner is correctly configured.
- The initial token supply is zero.
- The owner can mint tokens.
- The total supply increases after a mint.
- Successful mints to different test addresses with expected account balance and total supply changes.

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test --network polkadotTestnet
```

If tests are successful, you will see outputs similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
  <span data-ty="input">npx hardhat test --network polkadotTestnet</span>
  <span data-ty></span>
  <span data-ty>&nbsp;&nbsp;MyToken</span>

  <span data-ty></span>
  <span data-ty>&nbsp;&nbsp;6 passing (369ms)</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

## Deploy the Contract

You are now ready to deploy the contract to your chosen network. This example demonstrates deployment to the Polkadot TestNet. Deploy the contract as follows:

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyToken.ts --network polkadotTestnet
    ```

2. Confirm the target deployment network name and chain ID when prompted:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
      <span data-ty="input">npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyToken.ts --network polkadotTestnet</span>

# Deploy an ERC-20 Using Remix IDE

## Introduction

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank} tokens are fungible tokens commonly used for creating cryptocurrencies, governance tokens, and staking mechanisms. Polkadot Hub enables easy token deployment with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and tools via the EVM backend.

This tutorial covers deploying an ERC-20 contract on Polkadot Hub TestNet using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank}, a web-based development tool. The ERC-20 contract can be retrieved from OpenZeppelin's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.4.0/contracts/token/ERC20){target=\_blank} or their [Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A basic understanding of [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} programming and [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/){target=\_blank} fungible tokens.
- An EVM-compatible [wallet](/smart-contracts/connect/){target=\_blank} connected to Polkadot Hub. This example utilizes [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank}.
- Test tokens for gas fees, available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. See [Get Test Tokens](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank} for a guide to using the faucet.

## Create Your Contract

Follow the steps below to create the ERC-20 contract:

1. Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank} in your web browser.
2. Select the **Create new file** button under the **contracts** folder, and name your contract `MyToken.sol`.

    ![](/images/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-remix/remix-01.webp)

3. Now, paste the following ERC-20 contract code into `MyToken.sol`:

    ```solidity title="MyToken.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    // Compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts ^5.4.0
    pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

    import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
    import {ERC20Permit} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol";
    import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract MyToken is ERC20, Ownable, ERC20Permit {
        constructor(address initialOwner)
            ERC20("MyToken", "MTK")
            Ownable(initialOwner)
            ERC20Permit("MyToken")
        {}

        function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
            _mint(to, amount);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    !!! tip
        The [OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/){target=\_blank} was used to generate this example ERC-20 contract.
        
## Compile the Contract

Solidity source code compiles into bytecode that can be deployed on the blockchain. During this process, the compiler checks the contract for syntax errors, ensures type safety, and generates the machine-readable instructions needed for blockchain execution.

Ensure your `MyToken.sol` contract is open in the Remix IDE Editor, and use the following steps to compile:

1. Select the **Solidity Compiler** plugin from the left panel.
2. Select the **Compile MyToken.sol** button.

The **Solidity Compiler** icon will display a green checkmark once the contract compiles successfully. If any issues arise during contract compilation, errors and warnings will appear in the terminal panel at the bottom of the screen.

![](/images/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-remix/remix-03.gif)

## Deploy the Contract

Follow these steps to deploy the contract using Remix:

1. Select **Deploy & Run Transactions** from the left panel.
2. Ensure your MetaMask wallet is connected to Polkadot Hub TestNet, then select the **Environment** dropdown and select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**.
3. Configure the contract parameters by entering the address that will own the deployed token contract.
4. Select the **Deploy** button to initiate the deployment.
4. Approve the transaction in your MetaMask wallet when prompted.
6. You will see the transaction details in the terminal when the deployment succeeds, including the contract address and deployment transaction hash.

![](/images/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-remix/remix-04.gif)

Once successfully deployed, your contract will appear in the **Deployed Contracts** section, ready for interaction.

## Interact with the Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with your contract through Remix. Find your contract under **Deployed/Unpinned Contracts**, and select it to expand the available methods. In this example, you'll mint some tokens to a given address using the following steps:

1. Expand the **mint** function, then enter the recipient address and the amount (remember to add 18 zeros for one whole token).
2. Select **transact**.
3. Approve the transaction in your MetaMask wallet when prompted.
4. You will see a green check mark in the terminal when the transaction is successful.
5. You can also call the **balanceOf** function by passing the address of the **mint** call to confirm the new balance.

![](/images/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-remix/remix-05.gif)

Feel free to explore and interact with the contract's other functions by selecting the method, providing any required parameters, and confirming the transaction in MetaMask when prompted.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed an ERC-20 token contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet using Remix IDE. Consider the following resources to build upon your progress.

It requires no local installation and provides an intuitive interface for contract development.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} programming and [ERC-721 NFT](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) standards.
- An EVM-compatible [wallet](/smart-contracts/connect/){target=\_blank} connected to Polkadot Hub. This example utilizes [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank}.
- Test tokens for gas fees (available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}). See [Get Test Tokens](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank} for a guide to using the faucet.

## Create Your Contract

Follow the steps below to create the ERC-721 contract:

1. Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank} in your web browser.
2. Select the **Create new file** button under the **contracts** folder, and name your contract `MyNFT.sol`.

    ![](/images/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-remix/remix-01.webp)

3. Now, paste the following ERC-721 contract code into `MyNFT.sol`:

    ```solidity title="contracts/MyNFT.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
        uint256 private _nextTokenId;

        constructor(
            address initialOwner
        ) ERC721("MyToken", "MTK") Ownable(initialOwner) {}

        function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner {
            uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
            _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        }
    }

    ```

    !!! tip
        The [OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/){target=\_blank} was used to generate this example ERC-721 contract.

## Compile the Contract

Solidity source code compiles into bytecode that can be deployed on the blockchain. During this process, the compiler checks the contract for syntax errors, ensures type safety, and generates the machine-readable instructions needed for blockchain execution.

Ensure your `MyNFT.sol` contract is open in the Remix IDE Editor, and use the following steps to compile:

1. Select the **Solidity Compiler** plugin from the left panel.
2. Select the **Compile MyToken.sol** button.

The **Solidity Compiler** icon will display a green checkmark once the contract compiles successfully. If any issues arise during contract compilation, errors and warnings will appear in the terminal panel at the bottom of the screen.

## Deploy the Contract

Follow these steps to deploy the contract using Remix:

1. Select **Deploy & Run Transactions** from the left panel.
2. Ensure your MetaMask wallet is connected to Polkadot Hub TestNet, then select the **Environment** dropdown and select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**.

    ![](/images/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-remix/remix-03.webp)

3. Configure the contract parameters by entering the address that will own the deployed NFT contract.
4. Select the **Deploy** button to initiate the deployment.
5. Approve the transaction in your MetaMask wallet when prompted.
6. You will see the transaction details in the terminal when the deployment succeeds, including the contract address and deployment transaction hash.

![](/images/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-remix/remix-04.webp)

Once successfully deployed, your contract will appear in the **Deployed Contracts** section, ready for interaction.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed an ERC-721 NFT contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet using Remix IDE. Consider the following resources to build upon your progress.

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-cookbook-smart-contracts-deploy-nft-nft-hardhat.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-hardhat/
- Summary: Learn how to deploy an ERC-721 NFT contract to Polkadot Hub using Hardhat, a comprehensive development environment with built-in deployment capabilities.

# Deploy an ERC-721 Using Hardhat

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets commonly used for digital art, collectibles, gaming, and identity verification.

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721){target=\_blank} NFT contract to [Polkadot Hub](/smart-contracts/overview/#smart-contract-development){target=\_blank} TestNet. You'll use OpenZeppelin's battle-tested [NFT implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts){target=\_blank} and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/docs/getting-started){target=\_blank}, a comprehensive development environment with built-in testing, debugging, and deployment capabilities. Hardhat uses standard Solidity compilation to generate EVM bytecode, making it fully compatible with Polkadot Hub's EVM environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} programming and [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/){target=\_blank} non-fungible tokens.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\_blank} v22.13.1 or later installed.
- Test tokens for gas fees, available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. See [Get Test Tokens](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank} for a guide to using the faucet.
- A wallet with a private key for signing transactions.

## Set Up Your Project

1. Use the following terminal commands to create a directory and initialize your Hardhat project inside of it:

    ```bash
    mkdir hardhat-nft-deployment
    cd hardhat-nft-deployment
    npx hardhat@^2.27.0 init
    ```

2. Install the OpenZeppelin contract dependencies using the command:

    ```bash
    npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
    ```

## Configure Hardhat

Open `hardhat.config.ts` and update to add `polkadotTestnet` to the `networks` configuration as highlighted in the following example code:

```typescript title="hardhat.config.ts" hl_lines='18-23'
import type { HardhatUserConfig } from 'hardhat/config';

import hardhatToolboxViemPlugin from '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem';
import { vars } from 'hardhat/config';

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxViemPlugin],
  solidity: {
    version: '0.8.28',
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200,
      },
    },
  },
  networks: {
    polkadotTestnet: {
      url: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
      chainId: 420420422,
      accounts: [vars.get('PRIVATE_KEY')],
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

!!! tip
    Visit the Hardhat [Configuration variables](https://v2.hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables){target=\_blank} documentation to learn how to use Hardhat to handle your private keys securely.

## Create the Contract

Follow these steps to create your smart contract:

1. Delete the default contract file(s) in the `contracts` directory.

2. Create a new file named `MyNFT.sol` inside the `contracts` directory.

3. Add the following code to create the `MyNFT.sol` smart contract:
    ```solidity title="contracts/MyNFT.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
        uint256 private _nextTokenId;

        constructor(
            address initialOwner
        ) ERC721("MyToken", "MTK") Ownable(initialOwner) {}

        function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner {
            uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
            _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        }
    }

    ```

## Compile the Contract

Compile your `MyNFT.sol` contract using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

You will see a message in the terminal confirming the contract was successfully compiled, similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx hardhat compile</span>
  <span data-ty>Downloading solc 0.8.28</span>
  <span data-ty>Downloading solc 0.8.28 (WASM build)</span>
  <span data-ty>Compiled 1 Solidity file with solc 0.8.28 (evm target: cancun)</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>
## Deploy the Contract

You are now ready to deploy the contract to your chosen network. This example demonstrates deployment to the Polkadot TestNet. Deploy the contract as follows:

1. Delete the default file(s) inside the `ignition/modules` directory.

2. Create a new file named `MyNFT.ts` inside the `ignition/modules` directory.

3. Open `ignition/modules/MyNFT.ts` and add the following code to create your deployment module:
    ```typescript title="ignition/modules/MyNFT.ts"
    import { buildModule } from '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules';

    export default buildModule('MyNFTModule', (m) => {
      const initialOwner = m.getParameter('initialOwner', 'INSERT_OWNER_ADDRESS');
      const myNFT = m.contract('MyNFT', [initialOwner]);
      return { myNFT };
    });

    ```

    Replace `INSERT_OWNER_ADDRESS` with your desired owner address.

4. Deploy your contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/MyNFT.ts --network polkadotTestnet
    ```

5. Confirm the target deployment network name and chain ID when prompted:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
      <span data-ty="input">npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/MyNFT.ts --network polkadotHubTestnet</span>
      <span data-ty>✔ Confirm deploy to network polkadotTestnet (420420420)? … yes</span>

# Deploy an NFT with Foundry

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets commonly used for digital art, collectibles, gaming, and identity verification.

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721){target=\_blank} NFT contract to [Polkadot Hub](/smart-contracts/overview/#smart-contract-development){target=\_blank}. It showcases a secure approach using [OpenZeppelin's battle-tested NFT implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts){target=\_blank} and the [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank} toolchain. Foundry, a fast, Rust-written toolkit, ensures high-performance compilation and is fully compatible with the Hub’s EVM environment via standard Solidity compilation.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Solidity programming and NFT standards.
- Test tokens for gas fees (available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}). See the [step-by-step instructions](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank}.
- A wallet with a private key for signing transactions.

## Set Up Your Project

To get started, take the following steps:

1. Install Foundry:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    foundryup
    ```

2. Initialize your project:

    ```bash
    forge init foundry-nft-deployment
    cd foundry-nft-deployment
    ```

3. Install OpenZeppelin contracts:

    ```bash
    forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
    ```

## Configure Foundry

Edit `foundry.toml`:

```toml title="foundry.toml"
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
remappings = ['@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/']

[rpc_endpoints]
polkadot_hub_testnet = "https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io"
```

## Create Your Contract

Create `src/MyNFT.sol`:

```solidity title="src/MyNFT.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 private _nextTokenId;

    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC721("MyToken", "MTK")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
    {}

    function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

## Compile

```bash
forge build
```

Verify the compilation by inspecting the bytecode:

```bash
forge inspect MyNFT bytecode
```

## Deploy

Deploy to Polkadot Hub TestNet:

```bash
forge create MyNFT \
    --rpc-url polkadot_hub_testnet \
    --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --constructor-args YOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS \
    --broadcast
```

Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key and `YOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS` with the address that will own the NFT contract.

Page Title: Deploy Contracts to Polkadot Hub with Ethers.js

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-libraries-ethers-js.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/libraries/ethers-js/
- Summary: Learn how to interact with Polkadot Hub using Ethers.js, from compiling and deploying Solidity contracts to interacting with deployed smart contracts.

# Ethers.js

## Introduction

[Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank} is a lightweight library that enables interaction with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains through JavaScript. Ethers is widely used as a toolkit to establish connections and read and write blockchain data. This article demonstrates using Ethers.js to interact and deploy smart contracts to Polkadot Hub.

This guide is intended for developers who are familiar with JavaScript and want to interact with Polkadot Hub using Ethers.js.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.13.1 or later, check the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/){target=\_blank}.
- **npm**: v6.13.4 or later (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **Solidity**: This guide uses Solidity `^0.8.9` for smart contract development.

## Project Structure

This project organizes contracts, scripts, and compiled artifacts for easy development and deployment.

```text title="Ethers.js Polkadot Hub"
ethers-project
├── contracts
│   ├── Storage.sol
├── scripts
│   ├── connectToProvider.js
│   ├── fetchLastBlock.js
│   ├── compile.js
│   ├── deploy.js
│   ├── checkStorage.js

├── artifacts
│   ├── Storage.bin
├── contract-address.json
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

## Set Up the Project

To start working with Ethers.js, create a new folder and initialize your project by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir ethers-project
cd ethers-project
npm init -y
```

## Install Dependencies

Next, run the following command to install the Ethers.js library:

```bash
npm install ethers
```

Add the Solidity compiler so you can generate standard EVM bytecode:

```bash
npm install --save-dev solc
```

This guide uses `solc` version `0.8.33`.

!!! tip
    The sample scripts use ECMAScript modules. Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` (or rename the files to `.mjs`) so that `node` can run the `import` statements.

## Set Up the Ethers.js Provider

A [`Provider`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Provider){target=\_blank} is an abstraction of a connection to the Ethereum network, allowing you to query blockchain data and send transactions. It serves as a bridge between your application and the blockchain.

To interact with Polkadot Hub, you must set up an Ethers.js provider. This provider connects to a blockchain node, allowing you to query blockchain data and interact with smart contracts. In the root of your project, create a file named `connectToProvider.js` and add the following code:

```js title="scripts/connectToProvider.js"
const { JsonRpcProvider } = require('ethers');

const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
  const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, {
    chainId: chainId,
    name: chainName,
  });

  return provider;
};

const PROVIDER_RPC = {
  rpc: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
  chainId: 'INSERT_CHAIN_ID',
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
};

createProvider(PROVIDER_RPC.rpc, PROVIDER_RPC.chainId, PROVIDER_RPC.name);

```

!!! note
    Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, and `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME` with the appropriate values. For example, to connect to Polkadot Hub TestNet's Ethereum RPC instance, you can use the following parameters:

    ```js
    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
        rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
        chainId: 420420422,
        name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet'
    };
    ```

To connect to the provider, execute:

```bash
node scripts/connectToProvider.js
```

With the provider set up, you can start querying the blockchain. For instance, to fetch the latest block number:

??? code "fetchLastBlock.js code"

    ```js title="scripts/fetchLastBlock.js"
    const { JsonRpcProvider } = require('ethers');

    const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
      const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, {
        chainId: chainId,
        name: chainName,
      });

      return provider;
    };

    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
    };

    const main = async () => {
      try {
        const provider = createProvider(
          PROVIDER_RPC.rpc,
          PROVIDER_RPC.chainId,
          PROVIDER_RPC.name,
        );
        const latestBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber();
        console.log(`Latest block: ${latestBlock}`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + error.message);
      }
    };

    main();

    ```

## Compile Contracts

Polkadot Hub exposes an Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint, so you can compile Solidity contracts to familiar EVM bytecode with the upstream [`solc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc){target=\_blank} compiler. The resulting artifacts work with any EVM-compatible toolchain and can be deployed through Ethers.js.

### Sample Storage Smart Contract

This example demonstrates compiling a `Storage.sol` Solidity contract for deployment to Polkadot Hub. The contract's functionality stores a number and permits users to update it with a new value.

```solidity title="contracts/Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
// It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

### Compile the Smart Contract

To compile this contract, use the following script:

```js title="scripts/compile.js"
const solc = require('solc');
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync, mkdirSync, existsSync } = require('fs');
const { basename, join } = require('path');

const ensureDir = (dirPath) => {
  if (!existsSync(dirPath)) {
    mkdirSync(dirPath, { recursive: true });
  }
};

const compileContract = (solidityFilePath, abiDir, artifactsDir) => {
  try {
    // Read the Solidity file
    const source = readFileSync(solidityFilePath, 'utf8');
    const fileName = basename(solidityFilePath);
    
    // Construct the input object for the Solidity compiler
    const input = {
      language: 'Solidity',
      sources: {
        [fileName]: {
          content: source,
        },
      },
      settings: {
        outputSelection: {
          '*': {
            '*': ['abi', 'evm.bytecode'],
          },
        },
      },
    };
    
    console.log(`Compiling contract: ${fileName}...`);
    
    // Compile the contract
    const output = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
    
    // Check for errors
    if (output.errors) {
      const errors = output.errors.filter(error => error.severity === 'error');
      if (errors.length > 0) {
        console.error('Compilation errors:');
        errors.forEach(err => console.error(err.formattedMessage));
        return;
      }
      // Show warnings
      const warnings = output.errors.filter(error => error.severity === 'warning');
      warnings.forEach(warn => console.warn(warn.formattedMessage));
    }
    
    // Ensure output directories exist
    ensureDir(abiDir);
    ensureDir(artifactsDir);

    // Process compiled contracts
    for (const [sourceFile, contracts] of Object.entries(output.contracts)) {
      for (const [contractName, contract] of Object.entries(contracts)) {
        console.log(`Compiled contract: ${contractName}`);
        
        // Write the ABI
        const abiPath = join(abiDir, `${contractName}.json`);
        writeFileSync(abiPath, JSON.stringify(contract.abi, null, 2));
        console.log(`ABI saved to ${abiPath}`);
        
        // Write the bytecode
        const bytecodePath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.bin`);
        writeFileSync(bytecodePath, contract.evm.bytecode.object);
        console.log(`Bytecode saved to ${bytecodePath}`);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error compiling contracts:', error);
  }
};

const solidityFilePath = join(__dirname, '../contracts/Storage.sol');
const abiDir = join(__dirname, '../abis');
const artifactsDir = join(__dirname, '../artifacts');

compileContract(solidityFilePath, abiDir, artifactsDir);
```

!!! note 
     The script above is tailored to the `Storage.sol` contract. It can be adjusted for other contracts by changing the file name or modifying the ABI and bytecode paths.

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a JSON representation of your contract's functions, events, and their parameters. It serves as the interface between your JavaScript code and the deployed smart contract, allowing your application to know how to format function calls and interpret returned data.

Execute the script above by running:

```bash
node scripts/compile.js
```

After executing the script, the Solidity contract is compiled into standard EVM bytecode. The ABI and bytecode are saved into files with `.json` and `.bin` extensions, respectively. You can now proceed with deploying the contract to Polkadot Hub, as outlined in the next section.

## Deploy the Compiled Contract

To deploy your compiled contract to Polkadot Hub, you'll need a wallet with a private key to sign the deployment transaction.

You can create a `deploy.js` script in the root of your project to achieve this. The deployment script can be divided into key components:

1. Set up the required imports and utilities:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const { writeFileSync, existsSync, readFileSync } = require('fs');
    const { join } = require('path');
    const { ethers, JsonRpcProvider } = require('ethers');

    ```

2. Create a provider to connect to Polkadot Hub:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"

    // Creates a provider with specified RPC URL and chain details
    const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
      const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, {
        chainId: chainId,
        name: chainName,
      });
      return provider;
    };
    ```
 
3. Set up functions to read contract artifacts:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    // Reads and parses the ABI file for a given contract
    const getAbi = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const abiPath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.json`);
        return JSON.parse(readFileSync(abiPath, 'utf8'));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    // Reads the compiled bytecode for a given contract
    const getByteCode = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const bytecodePath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.bin`);
        const bytecode = readFileSync(bytecodePath, 'utf8').trim();
        // Add 0x prefix if not present
        return bytecode.startsWith('0x') ? bytecode : `0x${bytecode}`;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find bytecode for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    ```

4. Create the main deployment function:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const deployContract = async (contractName, mnemonic, providerConfig) => {
      console.log(`Deploying ${contractName}...`);
      try {
        // Step 1: Set up provider and wallet
        const provider = createProvider(
          providerConfig.rpc,
          providerConfig.chainId,
          providerConfig.name,
        );
        const walletMnemonic = ethers.Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic);
        const wallet = walletMnemonic.connect(provider);

        // Step 2: Create and deploy the contract
        const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(
          getAbi(contractName),
          getByteCode(contractName),
          wallet,
        );
        const contract = await factory.deploy();
        await contract.waitForDeployment();

        // Step 3: Save deployment information
        const address = await contract.getAddress();
        console.log(`Contract ${contractName} deployed at: ${address}`);

        const addressesFile = join(scriptsDir, 'contract-address.json');
        const addresses = existsSync(addressesFile)
          ? JSON.parse(readFileSync(addressesFile, 'utf8'))
          : {};

        addresses[contractName] = address;
        writeFileSync(addressesFile, JSON.stringify(addresses, null, 2), 'utf8');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to deploy contract ${contractName}:`, error);
      }
    };
    ```

5. Configure and execute the deployment:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const providerConfig = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io', //TODO: replace to `https://services.polkadothub-rpc.com/testnet` when ready
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
    };

    const mnemonic = 'INSERT_MNEMONIC';

    deployContract('Storage', mnemonic, providerConfig);
    ```

    !!! note
        A mnemonic (seed phrase) is a series of words that can generate multiple private keys and their corresponding addresses. It's used here to derive the wallet that will sign and pay for the deployment transaction. **Always keep your mnemonic secure and never share it publicly**.

        Ensure to replace the `INSERT_MNEMONIC` placeholder with your actual mnemonic.

??? code "View complete script"

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const { writeFileSync, existsSync, readFileSync } = require('fs');
    const { join } = require('path');
    const { ethers, JsonRpcProvider } = require('ethers');

    const scriptsDir = __dirname;
    const artifactsDir = join(__dirname, '../contracts');

    // Creates a provider with specified RPC URL and chain details
    const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
      const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, {
        chainId: chainId,
        name: chainName,
      });
      return provider;
    };

    // Reads and parses the ABI file for a given contract
    const getAbi = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const abiPath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.json`);
        return JSON.parse(readFileSync(abiPath, 'utf8'));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    // Reads the compiled bytecode for a given contract
    const getByteCode = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const bytecodePath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.bin`);
        const bytecode = readFileSync(bytecodePath, 'utf8').trim();
        // Add 0x prefix if not present
        return bytecode.startsWith('0x') ? bytecode : `0x${bytecode}`;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find bytecode for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    const deployContract = async (contractName, mnemonic, providerConfig) => {
      console.log(`Deploying ${contractName}...`);
      try {
        // Step 1: Set up provider and wallet
        const provider = createProvider(
          providerConfig.rpc,
          providerConfig.chainId,
          providerConfig.name,
        );
        const walletMnemonic = ethers.Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic);
        const wallet = walletMnemonic.connect(provider);

        // Step 2: Create and deploy the contract
        const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(
          getAbi(contractName),
          getByteCode(contractName),
          wallet,
        );
        const contract = await factory.deploy();
        await contract.waitForDeployment();

        // Step 3: Save deployment information
        const address = await contract.getAddress();
        console.log(`Contract ${contractName} deployed at: ${address}`);

        const addressesFile = join(scriptsDir, 'contract-address.json');
        const addresses = existsSync(addressesFile)
          ? JSON.parse(readFileSync(addressesFile, 'utf8'))
          : {};

        addresses[contractName] = address;
        writeFileSync(addressesFile, JSON.stringify(addresses, null, 2), 'utf8');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to deploy contract ${contractName}:`, error);
      }
    };

    const providerConfig = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io', //TODO: replace to `https://services.polkadothub-rpc.com/testnet` when ready
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
    };

    const mnemonic = 'INSERT_MNEMONIC';

    deployContract('Storage', mnemonic, providerConfig);
    ```

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
node scripts/deploy.js
```

After running this script, your contract will be deployed to Polkadot Hub, and its address will be saved in `contract-address.json` within your project directory. You can use this address for future contract interactions.

## Interact with the Contract

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling its functions. For example, to set a number, read it and then modify that number by its double, you can create a file named `checkStorage.js` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```js title="scripts/checkStorage.js"
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
const { join } = require('path');

const artifactsDir = join(__dirname, '../contracts');

const createProvider = (providerConfig) => {
  return new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerConfig.rpc, {
    chainId: providerConfig.chainId,
    name: providerConfig.name,
  });
};

const createWallet = (mnemonic, provider) => {
  return ethers.Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic).connect(provider);
};

const loadContractAbi = (contractName, directory = artifactsDir) => {
  const contractPath = join(directory, `${contractName}.json`);
  const contractJson = JSON.parse(readFileSync(contractPath, 'utf8'));
  return contractJson.abi || contractJson; // Depending on JSON structure
};

const createContract = (contractAddress, abi, wallet) => {
  return new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, wallet);
};

const interactWithStorageContract = async (
  contractName,
  contractAddress,
  mnemonic,
  providerConfig,
  numberToSet,
) => {
  try {
    console.log(`Setting new number in Storage contract: ${numberToSet}`);

    // Create provider and wallet
    const provider = createProvider(providerConfig);
    const wallet = createWallet(mnemonic, provider);

    // Load the contract ABI and create the contract instance
    const abi = loadContractAbi(contractName);
    const contract = createContract(contractAddress, abi, wallet);

    // Send a transaction to set the stored number
    const tx1 = await contract.setNumber(numberToSet);
    await tx1.wait(); // Wait for the transaction to be mined
    console.log(`Number successfully set to ${numberToSet}`);

    // Retrieve the updated number
    const storedNumber = await contract.storedNumber();
    console.log(`Retrieved stored number:`, storedNumber.toString());

    // Send a transaction to set the stored number
    const tx2 = await contract.setNumber(numberToSet * 2);
    await tx2.wait(); // Wait for the transaction to be mined
    console.log(`Number successfully set to ${numberToSet * 2}`);

    // Retrieve the updated number
    const updatedNumber = await contract.storedNumber();
    console.log(`Retrieved stored number:`, updatedNumber.toString());
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error interacting with Storage contract:', error.message);
  }
};

const providerConfig = {
  name: 'asset-hub-smart-contracts',
  rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
  chainId: 420420422,
};

const mnemonic = 'INSERT_MNEMONIC'
const contractName = 'Storage';
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'
const newNumber = 42;

interactWithStorageContract(
  contractName,
  contractAddress,
  mnemonic,
  providerConfig,
  newNumber,
);
```

Ensure you replace the `INSERT_MNEMONIC` and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` placeholders with actual values. Also, ensure the contract ABI file (`Storage.json`) is correctly referenced. The script prints the balance for `ADDRESS_TO_CHECK` before it writes and doubles the stored value, so pick any account you want to monitor.

To interact with the contract, run:

```bash
node scripts/checkStorage.js
```

## Where to Go Next

Now that you have the foundational knowledge to use Ethers.js with Polkadot Hub, you can:

- **Dive into Ethers.js utilities**: Discover additional Ethers.js features, such as wallet management, signing messages, etc.
- **Implement batch transactions**: Use Ethers.js to execute batch transactions for efficient multi-step contract interactions.
- **Build scalable applications**: Combine Ethers.js with frameworks like [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} or [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en){target=\_blank} to create full-stack decentralized applications (dApps).

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-libraries-web3-js.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-js/
- Summary: Learn how to interact with Polkadot Hub using Web3.js, from compiling and deploying Solidity contracts to interacting with deployed smart contracts.

# Web3.js

!!! warning
    Web3.js has been [sunset](https://blog.chainsafe.io/web3-js-sunset/){target=\_blank}. You can find guides on using [Ethers.js](/smart-contracts/libraries/ethers-js/){target=\_blank} and [viem](/smart-contracts/libraries/viem/){target=\_blank} in the Libraries section. 

## Introduction

Interacting with blockchains typically requires an interface between your application and the network. [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/){target=\_blank} offers this interface through a comprehensive collection of libraries, facilitating seamless interaction with the nodes using HTTP or WebSocket protocols. This guide illustrates how to utilize Web3.js specifically for interactions with Polkadot Hub.

This guide is intended for developers who are familiar with JavaScript and want to interact with the Polkadot Hub using Web3.js.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.13.1 or later, check the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/){target=\_blank}.
- **npm**: v6.13.4 or later (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **Solidity**: This guide uses Solidity `^0.8.9` for smart contract development.

## Project Structure

This project organizes contracts, scripts, and compiled artifacts for easy development and deployment.

```text

├── contracts
│   ├── Storage.sol
├── scripts
│   ├── connectToProvider.js
│   ├── fetchLastBlock.js

├── artifacts
│   ├── Storage.bin
├── contract-address.json
├── node_modules/
├── package.json

└── README.md
```

## Set Up the Project

To start working with Web3.js, create a new folder and initialize your project by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir web3js-project
cd web3js-project
npm init -y
```

## Install Dependencies

Next, run the following command to install the Web3.js library:

```bash
npm install web3
```

Add the Solidity compiler so you can generate standard EVM bytecode:

```bash
npm install --save-dev solc
```

## Set Up the Web3 Provider

The provider configuration is the foundation of any Web3.js application. It serves as a bridge between your application and the blockchain, allowing you to query blockchain data and interact with smart contracts.

To interact with Polkadot Hub, you must set up a Web3.js provider. This provider connects to a blockchain node, allowing you to query blockchain data and interact with smart contracts. In the `scripts` directory of your project, create a file named `connectToProvider.js` and add the following code:

```js title="scripts/connectToProvider.js"
const { Web3 } = require('web3');

const createProvider = (rpcUrl) => {
  const web3 = new Web3(rpcUrl);
  return web3;
};

const PROVIDER_RPC = {
  rpc: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
  chainId: 'INSERT_CHAIN_ID',
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
};

createProvider(PROVIDER_RPC.rpc);

```

!!! note
    Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, and `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME` with the appropriate values. For example, to connect to Polkadot Hub TestNet's Ethereum RPC instance, you can use the following parameters:

    ```js
    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet'
    };
    ```

To connect to the provider, execute:

```bash
node scripts/connectToProvider.js
```

With the provider set up, you can start querying the blockchain. For instance, to fetch the latest block number.

??? code "Fetch last block example"

    ```js title="scripts/fetchLastBlock.js"
    const { Web3 } = require('web3');

    const createProvider = (rpcUrl) => {
      const web3 = new Web3(rpcUrl);
      return web3;
    };

    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadotTestNet',
    };

    const main = async () => {
      try {
        const web3 = createProvider(PROVIDER_RPC.rpc);
        const latestBlock = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();
        console.log('Last block: ' + latestBlock);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + error.message);
      }
    };

    main();

    ```

## Compile Contracts

Polkadot Hub exposes an Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint, so you can compile Solidity contracts to familiar EVM bytecode with the upstream [`solc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc){target=\_blank} compiler. The resulting artifacts work with any EVM-compatible toolchain and can be deployed through Web3.js.

### Sample Storage Smart Contract

This example demonstrates compiling a `Storage.sol` Solidity contract for deployment to Polkadot Hub. The contract's functionality stores a number and permits users to update it with a new value.

```solidity title="contracts/Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

### Compile the Smart Contract

To compile this contract, use the following script:

```js title="scripts/compile.js"
const solc = require('solc');
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync, mkdirSync, existsSync } = require('fs');
const { basename, join } = require('path');

const ensureDir = (dirPath) => {
  if (!existsSync(dirPath)) {
    mkdirSync(dirPath, { recursive: true });
  }
};

const compileContract = (solidityFilePath, abiDir, artifactsDir) => {
  try {
    // Read the Solidity file
    const source = readFileSync(solidityFilePath, 'utf8');
    const fileName = basename(solidityFilePath);
    
    // Construct the input object for the Solidity compiler
    const input = {
      language: 'Solidity',
      sources: {
        [fileName]: {
          content: source,
        },
      },
      settings: {
        outputSelection: {
          '*': {
            '*': ['abi', 'evm.bytecode'],
          },
        },
      },
    };
    
    console.log(`Compiling contract: ${fileName}...`);
    
    // Compile the contract
    const output = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
    
    // Check for errors
    if (output.errors) {
      const errors = output.errors.filter(error => error.severity === 'error');
      if (errors.length > 0) {
        console.error('Compilation errors:');
        errors.forEach(err => console.error(err.formattedMessage));
        return;
      }
      // Show warnings
      const warnings = output.errors.filter(error => error.severity === 'warning');
      warnings.forEach(warn => console.warn(warn.formattedMessage));
    }
    
    // Ensure output directories exist
    ensureDir(abiDir);
    ensureDir(artifactsDir);

    // Process compiled contracts
    for (const [sourceFile, contracts] of Object.entries(output.contracts)) {
      for (const [contractName, contract] of Object.entries(contracts)) {
        console.log(`Compiled contract: ${contractName}`);
        
        // Write the ABI
        const abiPath = join(abiDir, `${contractName}.json`);
        writeFileSync(abiPath, JSON.stringify(contract.abi, null, 2));
        console.log(`ABI saved to ${abiPath}`);
        
        // Write the bytecode
        const bytecodePath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.bin`);
        writeFileSync(bytecodePath, contract.evm.bytecode.object);
        console.log(`Bytecode saved to ${bytecodePath}`);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error compiling contracts:', error);
  }
};

const solidityFilePath = join(__dirname, '../contracts/Storage.sol');
const abiDir = join(__dirname, '../abis');
const artifactsDir = join(__dirname, '../artifacts');

compileContract(solidityFilePath, abiDir, artifactsDir);
```

!!! note 
     The script above is tailored to the `Storage.sol` contract. It can be adjusted for other contracts by changing the file name or modifying the ABI and bytecode paths.

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a JSON representation of your contract's functions, events, and their parameters. It serves as the interface between your JavaScript code and the deployed smart contract, allowing your application to know how to format function calls and interpret returned data.

Execute the script above by running:

```bash
node scripts/compile.js
```

After executing the script, the Solidity contract is compiled into standard EVM bytecode. The ABI and bytecode are saved into files with `.json` and `.bin` extensions, respectively. You can now proceed with deploying the contract to Polkadot Hub, as outlined in the next section.

## Deploy the Compiled Contract

To deploy your compiled contract to Polkadot Hub, you'll need a wallet with a private key to sign the deployment transaction.

You can create a `deploy.js` script in the `scripts` directory of your project to achieve this. The deployment script can be divided into key components:

1. Set up the required imports and utilities:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const { writeFileSync, existsSync, readFileSync } = require('fs');
    const { join } = require('path');
    const { Web3 } = require('web3');

    const scriptsDir = __dirname;
    const abisDir = join(__dirname, '../abis');
    const artifactsDir = join(__dirname, '../artifacts');
    ```

2. Create a provider to connect to Polkadot Hub:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
      const web3 = new Web3(rpcUrl);
      return web3;
    };
    ```

3. Set up functions to read contract artifacts:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const getAbi = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const abiPath = join(abisDir, `${contractName}.json`);
        return JSON.parse(readFileSync(abiPath, 'utf8'));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    const getByteCode = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const bytecodePath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.bin`);
        const bytecode = readFileSync(bytecodePath, 'utf8').trim();
        return bytecode.startsWith('0x') ? bytecode : `0x${bytecode}`;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find bytecode for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };
    ```

4. Create the main deployment function:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const deployContract = async (contractName, privateKey, providerConfig) => {
      console.log(`Deploying ${contractName}...`);
      try {
        const web3 = createProvider(
          providerConfig.rpc,
          providerConfig.chainId,
          providerConfig.name,
        );

        const formattedPrivateKey = privateKey.startsWith('0x') ? privateKey : `0x${privateKey}`;
        const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(formattedPrivateKey);
        web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);
        web3.eth.defaultAccount = account.address;

        const abi = getAbi(contractName);
        const bytecode = getByteCode(contractName);
        const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);
        const deployTx = contract.deploy({
          data: bytecode,
        });

        const gas = await deployTx.estimateGas();
        const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();

        console.log(`Estimated gas: ${gas}`);
        console.log(`Gas price: ${web3.utils.fromWei(gasPrice, 'gwei')} gwei`);

        const deployedContract = await deployTx.send({
          from: account.address,
          gas: gas,
          gasPrice: gasPrice,
        });

        const address = deployedContract.options.address;
        console.log(`Contract ${contractName} deployed at: ${address}`);

        const addressesFile = join(scriptsDir, 'contract-address.json');
        const addresses = existsSync(addressesFile)
          ? JSON.parse(readFileSync(addressesFile, 'utf8'))
          : {};

        addresses[contractName] = address;
        writeFileSync(addressesFile, JSON.stringify(addresses, null, 2), 'utf8');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to deploy contract ${contractName}:`, error);
      }
    };
    ```

5. Configure and execute the deployment:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const providerConfig = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io', // TODO: replace to `https://services.polkadothub-rpc.com/testnet` when ready
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadotTestNet',
    };

    const privateKey = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';

    deployContract('Storage', privateKey, providerConfig);
    ```

    !!! note

        A private key is a hexadecimal string that is used to sign and pay for the deployment transaction. **Always keep your private key secure and never share it publicly**.

        Ensure to replace the `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` placeholder with your actual private key.

??? code "View complete script"

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const { writeFileSync, existsSync, readFileSync } = require('fs');
    const { join } = require('path');
    const { Web3 } = require('web3');

    const scriptsDir = __dirname;
    const abisDir = join(__dirname, '../abis');
    const artifactsDir = join(__dirname, '../artifacts');

    const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
      const web3 = new Web3(rpcUrl);
      return web3;
    };

    const getAbi = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const abiPath = join(abisDir, `${contractName}.json`);
        return JSON.parse(readFileSync(abiPath, 'utf8'));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    const getByteCode = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const bytecodePath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.bin`);
        const bytecode = readFileSync(bytecodePath, 'utf8').trim();
        return bytecode.startsWith('0x') ? bytecode : `0x${bytecode}`;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find bytecode for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    const deployContract = async (contractName, privateKey, providerConfig) => {
      console.log(`Deploying ${contractName}...`);
      try {
        const web3 = createProvider(
          providerConfig.rpc,
          providerConfig.chainId,
          providerConfig.name,
        );

        const formattedPrivateKey = privateKey.startsWith('0x') ? privateKey : `0x${privateKey}`;
        const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(formattedPrivateKey);
        web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);
        web3.eth.defaultAccount = account.address;

        const abi = getAbi(contractName);
        const bytecode = getByteCode(contractName);
        const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);
        const deployTx = contract.deploy({
          data: bytecode,
        });

        const gas = await deployTx.estimateGas();
        const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();

        console.log(`Estimated gas: ${gas}`);
        console.log(`Gas price: ${web3.utils.fromWei(gasPrice, 'gwei')} gwei`);

        const deployedContract = await deployTx.send({
          from: account.address,
          gas: gas,
          gasPrice: gasPrice,
        });

        const address = deployedContract.options.address;
        console.log(`Contract ${contractName} deployed at: ${address}`);

        const addressesFile = join(scriptsDir, 'contract-address.json');
        const addresses = existsSync(addressesFile)
          ? JSON.parse(readFileSync(addressesFile, 'utf8'))
          : {};

        addresses[contractName] = address;
        writeFileSync(addressesFile, JSON.stringify(addresses, null, 2), 'utf8');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to deploy contract ${contractName}:`, error);
      }
    };

    const providerConfig = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io', // TODO: replace to `https://services.polkadothub-rpc.com/testnet` when ready
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadotTestNet',
    };

    const privateKey = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';

    deployContract('Storage', privateKey, providerConfig);


    ```

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
node scripts/deploy.js
```

After running this script, your contract will be deployed to Polkadot Hub, and its address will be saved in `contract-address.json` within your project directory. You can use this address for future contract interactions.

## Interact with the Contract

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling its functions. For example, to read the current stored value and then update it to a new value, you can create a file named `updateStorage.js` in the `scripts` directory of your project and add the following code:

```js title="scripts/updateStorage.js"
const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
const { join } = require('path');
const { Web3 } = require('web3');

const abisDir = join(__dirname, '../abis');

const getAbi = (contractName) => {
  try {
    const abiPath = join(abisDir, `${contractName}.json`);
    return JSON.parse(readFileSync(abiPath, 'utf8'));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      `Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
      error.message,
    );
    throw error;
  }
};

const updateStorage = async (config) => {
  try {
    const web3 = new Web3(config.rpcUrl);
    const formattedPrivateKey = config.privateKey.startsWith('0x') ? config.privateKey : `0x${config.privateKey}`;
    const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(formattedPrivateKey);
    web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);

    const abi = getAbi('Storage');
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, config.contractAddress);

    const initialValue = await contract.methods.storedNumber().call();
    console.log('Current stored value:', initialValue);

    const updateTransaction = contract.methods.setNumber(1);
    const gasEstimate = await updateTransaction.estimateGas({
      from: account.address,
    });
    const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();

    const receipt = await updateTransaction.send({
      from: account.address,
      gas: gasEstimate,
      gasPrice: gasPrice,
    });

    console.log(`Transaction hash: ${receipt.transactionHash}`);

    const newValue = await contract.methods.storedNumber().call();
    console.log('New stored value:', newValue);

    return receipt;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Update failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

const config = {
  rpcUrl: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
  privateKey: 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY',
  contractAddress: 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
};

updateStorage(config)
  .then((receipt) => console.log('Update successful'))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Update error'));
```

Ensure you replace the `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` placeholders with actual values. Also, ensure the contract ABI file (`Storage.json`) is correctly referenced. The script reads the current stored value, sets it to 1, and then displays the updated value.

To interact with the contract, run:

```bash
node scripts/updateStorage.js
```

Page Title: Deploying Uniswap V2 on Polkadot

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-cookbook-eth-dapps-uniswap-v2.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/cookbook/eth-dapps/uniswap-v2/
- Summary: Learn how to deploy and test Uniswap V2 on Polkadot Hub using Hardhat, bringing AMM-based token swaps to the Polkadot ecosystem.

# Deploy Uniswap V2

## Introduction

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, allowing for permissionless token swaps without intermediaries. [Uniswap V2](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/overview){target=\_blank}, with its Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, revolutionized DEXs by enabling liquidity provision for any ERC-20 token pair.

This tutorial will guide you through how Uniswap V2 works so you can take advantage of it in your projects deployed to Polkadot Hub. By understanding these contracts, you'll gain hands-on experience with one of the most influential DeFi protocols and understand how it functions across blockchain ecosystems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Node.js (v16.0.0 or later) and npm installed.
- Basic understanding of Solidity and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with [Hardhat](/smart-contracts/dev-environments/hardhat/){target=\_blank} development environment.
- Some test tokens to cover transaction fees (obtained from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111){target=\_blank}).
- Basic understanding of how AMMs and liquidity pools work.

## Set Up the Project

Start by cloning the Uniswap V2 project:

1. Clone the Uniswap V2 repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples.git
    git checkout hardhat-polkadot-evm
    cd polkavm-hardhat-examples/uniswap-v2-polkadot/
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in your project root to store your private keys (you can use as an example the `env.example` file):

    ```text title=".env"
    LOCAL_PRIV_KEY="INSERT_LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY"
    AH_PRIV_KEY="INSERT_AH_PRIVATE_KEY"
    ```

    Ensure to replace `"INSERT_LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY"` with a private key available in the local environment (you can get them from this [file](https://github.com/paritytech/hardhat-polkadot/blob/main/packages/hardhat-polkadot-node/src/constants.ts#L21){target=\_blank}). And `"INSERT_AH_PRIVATE_KEY"` with the account's private key you want to use to deploy the contracts. You can get this by exporting the private key from your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

    !!!warning
        Keep your private key safe, and never share it with anyone. If it is compromised, your funds can be stolen.

5. Compile the contracts:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

If the compilation is successful, you should see the following output:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx hardhat compile</span>
  <span data-ty>Compiling 12 Solidity files</span>
  <span data-ty>Successfully compiled 12 Solidity files</span>
</div>

After running the above command, you should see the compiled contracts in the `artifacts` directory. This directory contains the ABI and bytecode of your contracts.

## Understanding Uniswap V2 Architecture

Before interacting with the contracts, it's essential to understand the core architecture that powers Uniswap V2. This model forms the basis of nearly every modern DEX implementation and operates under automated market making, token pair liquidity pools, and deterministic pricing principles.

At the heart of Uniswap V2 lies a simple but powerful system composed of two major smart contracts:

- **Factory contract**: The factory acts as a registry and creator of new trading pairs. When two ERC-20 tokens are to be traded, the Factory contract is responsible for generating a new Pair contract that will manage that specific token pair’s liquidity pool. It keeps track of all deployed pairs and ensures uniqueness—no duplicate pools can exist for the same token combination.
- **Pair contract**: Each pair contract is a decentralized liquidity pool that holds reserves of two ERC-20 tokens. These contracts implement the core logic of the AMM, maintaining a constant product invariant (x \* y = k) to facilitate swaps and price determination. Users can contribute tokens to these pools in return for LP (liquidity provider) tokens, which represent their proportional share of the reserves.

This minimal architecture enables Uniswap to be highly modular, trustless, and extensible. By distributing responsibilities across these components, developers, and users can engage with the protocol in a composable and predictable manner, making it an ideal foundation for DEX functionality across ecosystems, including Polkadot Hub.

The project scaffolding is as follows:

## Test the Contracts

You can run the provided test suite to ensure the contracts are working as expected. The tests cover various scenarios, including creating pairs, adding liquidity, and executing swaps.

To test it locally, you can run the following commands:

1. Run the local `revive-dev-node`, for this, you can check the [Local Development Node](/smart-contracts/dev-environments/local-dev-node/){target=\_blank} guide.

2. In a new terminal, run the tests:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test --network localNode
    ```

The result should look like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx hardhat test --network localNode</span>

</div>

## Deploy the Contracts

After successfully testing the contracts, you can deploy them to the local node or Polkadot Hub. The deployment script is located in the `scripts` directory and is named `deploy.js`. This script deploys the `Factory` and `Pair` contracts to the network.

To deploy the contracts, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localNode
```

This command deploys the contracts to your local blockchain for development and testing. If you want to deploy to Polkadot Hub, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polkadotHubTestNet
```

The command above deploys to the actual Polkadot Hub TestNet. It requires test tokens, persists on the network, and operates under real network conditions.

The deployment script will output the addresses of the deployed contracts. Save these addresses, as you will need them to interact with the contracts. For example, the output should look like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localNode</span>
  <span data-ty>Successfully compiled 12 Solidity files</span>
  <span data-ty>Deploying contracts using 0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac</span>

  <span data-ty>Pair deployed to : 0xF0e46847c8bFD122C4b5EEE1D4494FF7C5FC5104</span>
</div>

Page Title: Dual Virtual Machine Stack

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-for-eth-devs-dual-vm-stack.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/for-eth-devs/dual-vm-stack/
- Summary: Compare Polkadot’s dual smart contract VMs—REVM for EVM compatibility and PolkaVM for RISC-V performance, flexibility, and efficiency.

# Dual Virtual Machine Stack

## Introduction

Polkadot's smart contract platform supports two distinct virtual machine (VM) architectures, providing developers with flexibility in selecting the optimal execution backend for their specific needs. This approach strikes a balance between immediate Ethereum compatibility and long-term innovation, enabling developers to deploy either unmodified (Ethereum Virtual Machine) EVM contracts using Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine (REVM) or optimize for higher performance using PolkaVM (PVM).

Both VM options share common infrastructure, including RPC interfaces, tooling support, and precompiles. The following sections compare architectures and guide you in selecting the best VM for your project's needs.

## Migrate from EVM

The [REVM backend](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm){target=\_blank} integrates a complete Rust implementation of the EVM, enabling Solidity contracts to run unchanged on Polkadot's smart contract platform.

REVM allows developers to use their existing Ethereum tooling and infrastructure to build on Polkadot. Choose REVM to:

- Migrate existing Ethereum contracts without modifications.
- Retain exact EVM behavior for audit tools. 
- Use developer tools that rely upon inspecting EVM bytecode.
- Prioritize rapid deployment over optimization.
- Work with established Ethereum infrastructure and tooling to build on Polkadot.

REVM enables Ethereum developers to seamlessly migrate to Polkadot, achieving performance and fee improvements without modifying their existing contracts or developer tooling stack.

## Upgrade to PolkaVM

[**PolkaVM**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm){target=\_blank} is a custom virtual machine optimized for performance with [RISC-V-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V){target=\_blank} architecture, supporting Solidity and additional high-performance languages. It serves as the core execution environment, integrated directly within the runtime. Choose the PolkaVM for:

- An efficient interpreter for immediate code execution.
- A planned [Just In Time (JIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation){target=\_blank} compiler for optimized performance.
- Dual-mode execution capability, allowing selection of the most appropriate backend for specific workloads.
- Optimized performance for short-running contract calls through the interpreter.

The interpreter remains particularly beneficial for contracts with minimal code execution, as it enables immediate code execution through lazy interpretation.

## Architecture

The following key components of PolkaVM work together to enable Ethereum compatibility on Polkadot-based chains. 

### Revive Pallet

[**`pallet_revive`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} is a runtime module that executes smart contracts by adding extrinsics, runtime APIs, and logic to convert Ethereum-style transactions into formats compatible with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. It processes Ethereum-style transactions through the following workflow:

```mermaid

```

This proxy-based approach eliminates the need for node binary modifications, maintaining compatibility across different client implementations. Preserving the original Ethereum transaction payload simplifies the adaptation of existing tools, which can continue processing familiar transaction formats.

### PolkaVM Design Fundamentals

PolkaVM differs from the EVM in two key ways that make it faster, more hardware-efficient, and easier to extend:

- **Register-based design**: Instead of a stack machine, PolkaVM uses a RISC-V–style register model. This design:

    - Uses a fixed set of registers to pass arguments, not an infinite stack.
    - Maps cleanly to real hardware like x86-64.
    - Simplifies compilation and boosts runtime efficiency.
    - Enables tighter control over register allocation and performance tuning.

- **64-bit word size**: PolkaVM runs on a native 64-bit word size, aligning directly with modern CPUs. This design:

    - Executes arithmetic operations with direct hardware support.
    - Maintains compatibility with Solidity’s 256-bit types via YUL translation.
    - Accelerates computation-heavy workloads through native word alignment.
    - Integrates easily with low-level, performance-focused components.

# E2E Testing with Moonwall

## Introduction

Moonwall is an end-to-end testing framework designed explicitly for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. It addresses one of the most significant challenges in blockchain development: managing complex test environments and network configurations.

Moonwall consolidates this complexity by providing the following:

- A centralized configuration management system that explicitly defines all network parameters.
- A standardized approach to environment setup across different Substrate-based chains.
- Built-in utilities for common testing scenarios and network interactions.

Developers can focus on writing meaningful tests rather than managing infrastructure complexities or searching through documentation for configuration options.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank} (version 20.10 or higher).
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}, or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/){target=\_blank}.

## Install Moonwall

Moonwall can be installed globally for system-wide access or locally within specific projects. This section covers both installation methods.

!!! tip
    This documentation corresponds to Moonwall version `5.15.0`. To avoid compatibility issues with the documented features, ensure you're using the matching version.

### Global Installation

Global installation provides system-wide access to the Moonwall CLI, making it ideal for developers working across multiple blockchain projects. Install it by running one of the following commands:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install -g @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm -g install @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn global add @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

Now, you can run the `moonwall` command from your terminal.

### Local Installation

Local installation is recommended for better dependency management and version control within a specific project. First, initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir my-moonwall-project
cd my-moonwall-project
npm init -y
```

Then, install it as a local dependency:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

## Initialize Moonwall

The `moonwall init` command launches an interactive wizard to create your configuration file:

```bash
moonwall init
```

During setup, you will see prompts for the following parameters:

- **`label`**: Identifies your test configuration.
- **`global timeout`**: Maximum time (ms) for test execution.
- **`environment name`**: Name for your testing environment.
- **`network foundation`**: Type of blockchain environment to use.
- **`tests directory`**: Location of your test files.

Select `Enter` to accept defaults or input custom values. You should see something like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>moonwall init</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide a label for the config file moonwall_config</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide a global timeout value 30000</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide a name for this environment default_env</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ What type of network foundation is this? dev</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide the path for where tests for this environment are kept tests/</span>
  <span data-ty>? Would you like to generate this config? (no to restart from beginning) (Y/n)</span>
</div>

The wizard generates a `moonwall.config` file:

```json
{
    "label": "moonwall_config",
    "defaultTestTimeout": 30000,
    "environments": [
        {
            "name": "default_env",
            "testFileDir": ["tests/"],
            "foundation": {
                "type": "dev"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The default configuration requires specific details about your blockchain node and test requirements:

- The `foundation` object defines how your test blockchain node will be launched and managed. The dev foundation, which runs a local node binary, is used for local development.

    For more information about available options, check the [Foundations](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/foundations.html){target=\_blank} section.

- The `connections` array specifies how your tests will interact with the blockchain node. This typically includes provider configuration and endpoint details.

    A provider is a tool that allows you or your application to connect to a blockchain network and simplifies the low-level details of the process. A provider handles submitting transactions, reading state, and more. For more information on available providers, check the [Providers supported](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/providers.html#providers-supported){target=\_blank} page in the Moonwall documentation.

Here's a complete configuration example for testing a local node using Polkadot.js as a provider:

```json
{
    "label": "moonwall_config",
    "defaultTestTimeout": 30000,
    "environments": [
        {
            "name": "default_env",
            "testFileDir": ["tests/"],
            "foundation": {
                "launchSpec": [
                    {
                        "binPath": "./node-template",
                        "newRpcBehaviour": true,
                        "ports": { "rpcPort": 9944 }
                    }
                ],
                "type": "dev"
            },
            "connections": [
                {
                    "name": "myconnection",
                    "type": "polkadotJs",
                    "endpoints": ["ws://127.0.0.1:9944"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

## Writing Tests

Moonwall uses the [`describeSuite`](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/moonwall/blob/7568048c52e9f7844f38fb4796ae9e1b9205fdaa/packages/cli/src/lib/runnerContext.ts#L65){target=\_blank} function to define test suites, like using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/){target=\_blank}. Each test suite requires the following:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the suite.
- **`title`**: Descriptive name for the suite.
- **`foundationMethods`**: Specifies the testing environment (e.g., `dev` for local node testing).
- **`testCases`**: A callback function that houses the individual test cases of this suite.

The following example shows how to test a balance transfer between two accounts:

```ts
import '@polkadot/api-augment';
import { describeSuite, expect } from '@moonwall/cli';
import { Keyring } from '@polkadot/api';

describeSuite({
  id: 'D1',
  title: 'Demo suite',
  foundationMethods: 'dev',
  testCases: ({ it, context, log }) => {
    it({
      id: 'T1',
      title: 'Test Case',
      test: async () => {
        // Set up polkadot.js API and testing accounts
        let api = context.polkadotJs();
        let alice = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' }).addFromUri('//Alice');
        let charlie = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' }).addFromUri('//Charlie');

        // Query Charlie's account balance before transfer
        const balanceBefore = (await api.query.system.account(charlie.address))
          .data.free;

        // Before transfer, Charlie's account balance should be 0
        expect(balanceBefore.toString()).toEqual('0');
        log('Balance before: ' + balanceBefore.toString());

        // Transfer from Alice to Charlie
        const amount = 1000000000000000;
        await api.tx.balances
          .transferAllowDeath(charlie.address, amount)
          .signAndSend(alice);

        // Wait for the transaction to be included in a block.
        // This is necessary because the balance is not updated immediately.
        // Block time is 6 seconds.
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 6000));

        // Query Charlie's account balance after transfer
        const balanceAfter = (await api.query.system.account(charlie.address))
          .data.free;

        // After transfer, Charlie's account balance should be 1000000000000000
        expect(balanceAfter.toString()).toEqual(amount.toString());
        log('Balance after: ' + balanceAfter.toString());
      },
    });
  },
});

```

This test demonstrates several key concepts:

- Initializing the Polkadot.js API through Moonwall's context and setting up test accounts.
- Querying on-chain state.
- Executing transactions.
- Waiting for block inclusion.
- Verifying results using assertions.

## Running the Tests

Execute your tests using the `test` Moonwall CLI command. For the default environment setup run:

```bash
moonwall test default_env -c moonwall.config
```

The test runner will output detailed results showing:

- Test suite execution status.
- Individual test case results.
- Execution time.
- Detailed logs and error messages (if any).

Example output:
<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>moonwall test default_env -c moonwall.config</span>
  <span data-ty>stdout | tests/test1.ts > 🗃️ D1 Demo suite > 📁 D1T1 Test Case</span>

Page Title: Fork a Parachain Using Chopsticks

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/parachains-testing-fork-a-parachain.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/parachains/testing/fork-a-parachain/
- Summary: Simplify Polkadot SDK development with Chopsticks. Learn essential features, how to install Chopsticks, and how to configure local blockchain forks.

# Fork a Parachain Using Chopsticks

## Introduction

[Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/){target=\_blank}, developed by the [Acala Foundation](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork){target=\_blank}, is a versatile tool tailored for developers working on Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. With Chopsticks, you can fork live chains locally, replay blocks to analyze extrinsics, and simulate complex scenarios like XCM interactions all without deploying to a live network.

This guide walks you through installing Chopsticks and provides information on configuring a local blockchain fork. By streamlining testing and experimentation, Chopsticks empowers developers to innovate and accelerate their blockchain projects within the Polkadot ecosystem.

For additional support and information, please reach out through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/issues){target=_blank}.

!!! warning
    Chopsticks uses [Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=_blank} light client, which only supports the native Polkadot SDK API. Consequently, a Chopsticks-based fork doesn't support Ethereum JSON-RPC calls, meaning you cannot use it to fork your chain and connect Metamask.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank}.
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, which should be installed with Node.js by default, or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}.

## Install Chopsticks

You can install Chopsticks globally or locally in your project. Choose the option that best fits your development workflow. This documentation explains the features of Chopsticks version `1.2.2`. Make sure you're using the correct version to match these instructions.

### Global Installation

To install Chopsticks globally, allowing you to use it across multiple projects, run:

```bash
npm i -g @acala-network/chopsticks@1.2.2
```

Now, you should be able to run the `chopsticks` command from your terminal.

### Local Installation

To use Chopsticks in a specific project, first create a new directory and initialize a Node.js project:

```bash
mkdir my-chopsticks-project
cd my-chopsticks-project
npm init -y
```

Then, install Chopsticks as a local dependency:

```bash
npm i @acala-network/chopsticks@1.2.2
```

Finally, you can run Chopsticks using the `npx` command. To see all available options and commands, run it with the `--help` flag:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks --help
```

## Configure Chopsticks

To run Chopsticks, you need to configure some parameters. This can be set either through using a configuration file or the command line interface (CLI). The parameters that can be configured are as follows:

- **`genesis`**: The link to a parachain's raw genesis file to build the fork from, instead of an endpoint.
- **`timestamp`**: Timestamp of the block to fork from.
- **`endpoint`**: The endpoint of the parachain to fork.
- **`block`**: Use to specify at which block hash or number to replay the fork.
- **`wasm-override`**: Path of the Wasm to use as the parachain runtime, instead of an endpoint's runtime.
- **`db`**: Path to the name of the file that stores or will store the parachain's database.
- **`config`**: Path or URL of the config file.
- **`port`**: The port to expose an endpoint on.
- **`build-block-mode`**: How blocks should be built in the fork: batch, manual, instant.
- **`import-storage`**: A pre-defined JSON/YAML storage path to override in the parachain's storage.
- **`allow-unresolved-imports`**: Whether to allow Wasm unresolved imports when using a Wasm to build the parachain.
- **`html`**: Include to generate storage diff preview between blocks.
- **`mock-signature-host`**: Mock signature host so that any signature starts with `0xdeadbeef` and filled by `0xcd` is considered valid.

### Configuration File

The Chopsticks source repository includes a collection of [YAML](https://yaml.org/){target=\_blank} files that can be used to set up various Polkadot SDK chains locally. You can download these configuration files from the [repository's `configs` folder](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/tree/master/configs){target=\_blank}.

An example of a configuration file for Polkadot is as follows:

{% raw %}
```yaml
endpoint:
  - wss://rpc.ibp.network/polkadot
  - wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com
mock-signature-host: true
block: ${env.POLKADOT_BLOCK_NUMBER}
db: ./db.sqlite
runtime-log-level: 5

import-storage:
  System:
    Account:
      - - - 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
        - providers: 1
          data:
            free: '10000000000000000000'
  ParasDisputes:
    $removePrefix: ['disputes'] # those can makes block building super slow

```
{% endraw %}

The configuration file allows you to modify the storage of the forked network by rewriting the pallet, state component and value that you want to change. For example, Polkadot's file rewrites Alice's `system.Account` storage so that the free balance is set to `10000000000000000000`.

### CLI Flags

Alternatively, all settings (except for genesis and timestamp) can be configured via command-line flags, providing a comprehensive method to set up the environment.

## WebSocket Commands

Page Title: Get Started with XCM

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/parachains-interoperability-get-started.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/parachains/interoperability/get-started/
- Summary: Unlock blockchain interoperability with XCM — Polkadot's Cross-Consensus Messaging format for cross-chain interactions.

# Get Started with XCM

## Introduction

Polkadot’s unique value lies in its ability to enable interoperability between parachains and other blockchain systems. At the core of this capability is XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging)—a flexible messaging format that facilitates communication and collaboration between independent consensus systems.

With XCM, one chain can send intents to another one, fostering a more interconnected ecosystem. Although it was developed specifically for Polkadot, XCM is a universal format, usable in any blockchain environment. This guide provides an overview of XCM’s core principles, design, and functionality, alongside practical examples of its implementation.

## Messaging Format

XCM is not a protocol but a standardized [messaging format](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format){target=\_blank}. It defines the structure and behavior of messages but does not handle their delivery. This separation allows developers to focus on crafting instructions for target systems without worrying about transmission mechanics.

XCM messages are intent-driven, outlining desired actions for the receiving blockchain to consider and potentially alter its state. These messages do not directly execute changes; instead, they rely on the host chain's environment to interpret and implement them. By utilizing asynchronous composability, XCM facilitates efficient execution where messages can be processed independently of their original order, similar to how RESTful services handle HTTP requests without requiring sequential processing.

## The Four Principles of XCM

XCM adheres to four guiding principles that ensure robust and reliable communication across consensus systems:

- **Asynchronous**: XCM messages operate independently of sender acknowledgment, avoiding delays due to blocked processes.
- **Absolute**: XCM messages are guaranteed to be delivered and interpreted accurately, in order, and timely. Once a message is sent, one can be sure it will be processed as intended.
- **Asymmetric**: XCM messages follow the 'fire and forget' paradigm meaning no automatic feedback is provided to the sender. Any results must be communicated separately to the sender with an additional message back to the origin.
- **Agnostic**: XCM operates independently of the specific consensus mechanisms, making it compatible across diverse systems.

These principles guarantee that XCM provides a reliable framework for cross-chain communication, even in complex environments.

## The XCM Tech Stack

![Diagram of the XCM tech stack](/images/parachains/interoperability/get-started/intro-to-xcm-01.webp)

The XCM tech stack is designed to facilitate seamless interoperable communication between chains that reside within the Polkadot ecosystem. XCM can be used to express the meaning of the messages over each of the communication channels.

## Core Functionalities of XCM

XCM enhances cross-consensus communication by introducing several powerful features:

- **Programmability**: Supports dynamic message handling, allowing for more comprehensive use cases. Includes branching logic, safe dispatches for version checks, and asset operations like NFT management.
- **Functional Multichain Decomposition**: Enables mechanisms such as remote asset locking, asset namespacing, and inter-chain state referencing, with contextual message identification.
- **Bridging**: Establishes a universal reference framework for multi-hop setups, connecting disparate systems like Ethereum and Bitcoin with the Polkadot relay chain acting as a universal location.

The standardized format for messages allows parachains to handle tasks like user balances, governance, and staking, freeing the Polkadot relay chain to focus on shared security. These features make XCM indispensable for implementing scalable and interoperable blockchain applications. 

## XCM Example

The following is a simplified XCM message demonstrating a token transfer from Alice to Bob on the same chain (ParaA).

```rust
let message = Xcm(vec![
    WithdrawAsset((Here, amount).into()),
    BuyExecution { 
        fees: (Here, amount).into(), 
        weight_limit: WeightLimit::Unlimited 
    },
    DepositAsset {
        assets: All.into(),
        beneficiary: MultiLocation {
            parents: 0,
            interior: Junction::AccountId32 {
                network: None,
                id: BOB.clone().into()
            }.into(),
        }.into()
    }
]);
```

The message consists of three instructions described as follows:

- **[WithdrawAsset](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#withdrawasset){target=\_blank}**: Transfers a specified number of tokens from Alice's account to a holding register.

    ```rust
        WithdrawAsset((Here, amount).into()),
    ```

    - **`Here`**: The native parachain token.
    - **`amount`**: The number of tokens that are transferred.

    The first instruction takes as an input the MultiAsset that should be withdrawn. The MultiAsset describes the native parachain token with the `Here` keyword. The `amount` parameter is the number of tokens that are transferred. The withdrawal account depends on the origin of the message. In this example the origin of the message is Alice. The `WithdrawAsset` instruction moves `amount` number of native tokens from Alice's account into the holding register.

- **[BuyExecution](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#buyexecution){target=\_blank}**: Allocates fees to cover the execution weight of the XCM instructions.

    

    ```rust
        BuyExecution { 
            fees: (Here, amount).into(), 
            weight_limit: WeightLimit::Unlimited 
        },
    ```

    - **`fees`**: Describes the asset in the holding register that should be used to pay for the weight.
    - **`weight_limit`**: Defines the maximum fees that can be used to buy weight.

- **[DepositAsset](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#depositasset){target=\_blank}**: Moves the remaining tokens from the holding register to Bob’s account.

    ```rust
        DepositAsset {
            assets: All.into(),
            beneficiary: MultiLocation {
                parents: 0,
                interior: Junction::AccountId32 {
                    network: None,
                    id: BOB.clone().into()
                }.into(),
            }.into()
        }
    ```

    - **`All`**: The wildcard for the asset(s) to be deposited. In this case, all assets in the holding register should be deposited.
    
This step-by-step process showcases how XCM enables precise state changes within a blockchain system. You can find a complete XCM message example in the [XCM repository](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-docs/blob/main/examples/src/0_first_look/mod.rs){target=\_blank}.

## Overview

XCM revolutionizes cross-chain communication by enabling use cases such as:

- Token transfers between blockchains.
- Asset locking for cross-chain smart contract interactions.
- Remote execution of functions on other blockchains.

These functionalities empower developers to build innovative, multi-chain applications, leveraging the strengths of various blockchain networks.

In authority round (Aura) consensus, most online authorities are assumed to be honest. It is often used in combination with [GRANDPA](#grandpa) as a [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus) protocol.

Learn more by reading the official [Aura consensus algorithm](https://openethereum.github.io/Aura){target=\_blank} wiki article.

## Blind Assignment of Blockchain Extension (BABE)

A [block authoring](#block-author) protocol similar to [Aura](#authority-round-aura), except [authorities](#authority) win [slots](#slot) based on a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) instead of the round-robin selection method. The winning authority can select a chain and submit a new block.

Learn more by reading the official Web3 Foundation [BABE research document](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/protocols/block-production/Babe){target=\_blank}.

## Block Author

The node responsible for the creation of a block, also called _block producers_. In a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, these nodes are called _miners_.

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

The ability of a distributed computer network to remain operational if a certain proportion of its nodes or [authorities](#authority) are defective or behaving maliciously. A distributed network is typically considered Byzantine fault tolerant if it can remain functional, with up to one-third of nodes assumed to be defective, offline, actively malicious, and part of a coordinated attack.

### Byzantine Failure

The loss of a network service due to node failures that exceed the proportion of nodes required to reach consensus.

### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)

An early approach to Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) systems tolerate Byzantine behavior from up to one-third of participants.

The communication overhead for such systems is `O(n²)`, where `n` is the number of nodes (participants) in the system.

### Preimage

A preimage is the data that is input into a hash function to calculate a hash. Since a hash function is a [one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function){target=\_blank}, the output, the hash, cannot be used to reveal the input, the preimage.

## Call

In the context of pallets containing functions to be dispatched to the runtime, `Call` is an enumeration data type that describes the functions that can be dispatched with one variant per pallet. A `Call` represents a [dispatch](#dispatchable) data structure object.

## Chain Specification 

A chain specification file defines the properties required to run a node in an active or new Polkadot SDK-built network. It often contains the initial genesis runtime code, network properties (such as the network's name), the initial state for some pallets, and the boot node list. The chain specification file makes it easy to use a single Polkadot SDK codebase as the foundation for multiple independently configured chains.

## Collator

An [author](#block-author) of a [parachain](#parachain) network.
They aren't [authorities](#authority) in themselves, as they require a [relay chain](#relay-chain) to coordinate [consensus](#consensus).

More details are found on the [Polkadot Collator Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-collator/){target=\_blank}.

## Collective

Most often used to refer to an instance of the Collective pallet on Polkadot SDK-based networks such as [Kusama](#kusama) or [Polkadot](#polkadot) if the Collective pallet is part of the FRAME-based runtime for the network.

## Consensus

Consensus is the process blockchain nodes use to agree on a chain's canonical fork. It is composed of [authorship](#block-author), finality, and [fork-choice rule](#fork-choice-rulestrategy). In the Polkadot ecosystem, these three components are usually separate and the term consensus often refers specifically to authorship.

See also [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus).

## Consensus Algorithm

Ensures a set of [actors](#authority)—who don't necessarily trust each other—can reach an agreement about the state as the result of some computation. Most consensus algorithms assume that up to one-third of the actors or nodes can be [Byzantine fault tolerant](#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft).

Consensus algorithms are generally concerned with ensuring two properties:

- **Safety**: Indicating that all honest nodes eventually agreed on the state of the chain.
- **Liveness**: Indicating the ability of the chain to keep progressing.

## Consensus Engine

The node subsystem responsible for consensus tasks.

For detailed information about the consensus strategies of the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network, see the [Polkadot Consensus](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank} blog series.

See also [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus).

## Coretime

The time allocated for utilizing a core, measured in relay chain blocks. There are two types of coretime: *on-demand* and *bulk*.

On-demand coretime refers to coretime acquired through bidding in near real-time for the validation of a single parachain block on one of the cores reserved specifically for on-demand orders. They are available as an on-demand coretime pool. Set of cores that are available on-demand. Cores reserved through bulk coretime could also be made available in the on-demand coretime pool, in parts or in entirety.

Bulk coretime is a fixed duration of continuous coretime represented by an NFT that can be split, shared, or resold. It is managed by the [Broker pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## Development Phrase

A [mnemonic phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic#For_numerical_sequences_and_mathematical_operations){target=\_blank} that is intentionally made public.

Well-known development accounts, such as Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve, and Ferdie, are generated from the same secret phrase:

```
bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk
```

Many tools in the Polkadot SDK ecosystem, such as [`subkey`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/polkadot-stable2506-2/substrate/bin/utils/subkey){target=\_blank}, allow you to implicitly specify an account using a derivation path such as `//Alice`.

## Digest

An extensible field of the [block header](#header) that encodes information needed by several actors in a blockchain network, including:

- [Light clients](#light-client) for chain synchronization.
- Consensus engines for block verification.
- The runtime itself, in the case of pre-runtime digests.

## Dispatchable

Function objects that act as the entry points in FRAME [pallets](#pallet). Internal or external entities can call them to interact with the blockchain’s state. They are a core aspect of the runtime logic, handling [transactions](#transaction) and other state-changing operations.

## Events

A means of recording that some particular [state](#state) transition happened.

In the context of [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities), events are composable data types that each [pallet](#pallet) can individually define. Events in FRAME are implemented as a set of transient storage items inspected immediately after a block has been executed and reset during block initialization.

## Executor

A means of executing a function call in a given [runtime](#runtime) with a set of dependencies.
There are two orchestration engines in Polkadot SDK, _WebAssembly_ and _native_.

- The _native executor_ uses a natively compiled runtime embedded in the node to execute calls. This is a performance optimization available to up-to-date nodes.

- The _WebAssembly executor_ uses a [Wasm](#webassembly-wasm) binary and a Wasm interpreter to execute calls. The binary is guaranteed to be up-to-date regardless of the version of the blockchain node because it is persisted in the [state](#state) of the Polkadot SDK-based chain.

## Existential Deposit

The minimum balance an account is allowed to have in the [Balances pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/index.html){target=\_blank}. Accounts cannot be created with a balance less than the existential deposit amount. 

If an account balance drops below this amount, the Balances pallet uses [a FRAME System API](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.dec_ref){target=\_blank} to drop its references to that account.

If the Balances pallet reference to an account is dropped, the account can be [reaped](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.allow_death){target=\_blank}.

## Extrinsic

A general term for data that originates outside the runtime, is included in a block, and leads to some action. This includes user-initiated transactions and inherent transactions placed into the block by the block builder.

It is a SCALE-encoded array typically consisting of a version number, signature, and varying data types indicating the resulting runtime function to be called. Extrinsics can take two forms: [inherents](#inherent-transactions) and [transactions](#transaction). 

For more technical details, see the [Polkadot spec](https://spec.polkadot.network/id-extrinsics){target=\_blank}.

## Fork Choice Rule/Strategy

A fork choice rule or strategy helps determine which chain is valid when reconciling several network forks. A common fork choice rule is the [longest chain](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/struct.LongestChain.html){target=\_blank}, in which the chain with the most blocks is selected.

## FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)

Enables developers to create blockchain [runtime](#runtime) environments from a modular set of components called [pallets](#pallet). It utilizes a set of procedural macros to construct runtimes.

[Visit the Polkadot SDK docs for more details on FRAME.](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html){target=\_blank}

## Full Node

A node that prunes historical states, keeping only recently finalized block states to reduce storage needs. Full nodes provide current chain state access and allow direct submission and validation of [extrinsics](#extrinsic), maintaining network decentralization.

## Genesis Configuration

A mechanism for specifying the initial state of a blockchain. By convention, this initial state or first block is commonly referred to as the genesis state or genesis block. The genesis configuration for Polkadot SDK-based chains is accomplished by way of a [chain specification](#chain-specification) file.

## GRANDPA

A deterministic finality mechanism for blockchains that is implemented in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language.

The [formal specification](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa-old.pdf){target=\_blank} is maintained by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/){target=\_blank}.

## Header

A structure that aggregates the information used to summarize a block. Primarily, it consists of cryptographic information used by [light clients](#light-client) to get minimally secure but very efficient chain synchronization.

## Hybrid Consensus

A blockchain consensus protocol that consists of independent or loosely coupled mechanisms for [block production](#block-author) and finality.

Hybrid consensus allows the chain to grow as fast as probabilistic consensus protocols, such as [Aura](#authority-round-aura), while maintaining the same level of security as deterministic finality consensus protocols, such as [GRANDPA](#grandpa).

## Inherent Transactions

A special type of unsigned transaction, referred to as _inherents_, that enables a block authoring node to insert information that doesn't require validation directly into a block.

Only the block-authoring node that calls the inherent transaction function can insert data into its block. In general, validators assume the data inserted using an inherent transaction is valid and reasonable even if it can't be deterministically verified.

## JSON-RPC

A stateless, lightweight remote procedure call protocol encoded in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON-RPC provides a standard way to call functions on a remote system by using JSON.

For Polkadot SDK, this protocol is implemented through the [Parity JSON-RPC](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpc){target=\_blank} crate.

## Keystore

A subsystem for managing keys for the purpose of producing new blocks.

## Kusama

[Kusama](https://kusama.network/){target=\_blank} is a Polkadot SDK-based blockchain that implements a design similar to the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network.

Kusama is a [canary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine){target=\_blank} network and is referred to as [Polkadot's "wild cousin."](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-comparisons-kusama/){target=\_blank}.

As a canary network, Kusama is expected to be more stable than a test network like [Westend](#westend) but less stable than a production network like [Polkadot](#polkadot). Kusama is controlled by its network participants and is intended to be stable enough to encourage meaningful experimentation.

## libp2p

A peer-to-peer networking stack that allows the use of many transport mechanisms, including WebSockets (usable in a web browser).

Polkadot SDK uses the [Rust implementation](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p){target=\_blank} of the `libp2p` networking stack.

## Light Client

A type of blockchain node that doesn't store the [chain state](#state) or produce blocks.

A light client can verify cryptographic primitives and provides a [remote procedure call (RPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call){target=\_blank} server, enabling blockchain users to interact with the network.

## Metadata

Data that provides information about one or more aspects of a system.
The metadata that exposes information about a Polkadot SDK blockchain enables you to interact with that system.

## Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)

A method for determining [validators](#validator) or _[authorities](#authority)_ based on a willingness to commit their stake to the proper functioning of one or more block-producing nodes.

## Oracle

An entity that connects a blockchain to a non-blockchain data source. Oracles enable the blockchain to access and act upon information from existing data sources and incorporate data from non-blockchain systems and services.

## Origin

A [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities) primitive that identifies the source of a [dispatched](#dispatchable) function call into the [runtime](#runtime). The FRAME System pallet defines three built-in [origins](#origin). As a [pallet](#pallet) developer, you can also define custom origins, such as those defined by the [Collective pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_collective/enum.RawOrigin.html){target=\_blank}.

## Pallet

A module that can be used to extend the capabilities of a [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities)-based [runtime](#runtime).
Pallets bundle domain-specific logic with runtime primitives like [events](#events) and [storage items](#storage-item).

## Parachain

A parachain is a blockchain that derives shared infrastructure and security from a _[relay chain](#relay-chain)_.
You can learn more about parachains on the [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-parachains/){target=\_blank}.

## Paseo

Paseo TestNet provisions testing on Polkadot's "production" runtime, which means less chance of feature or code mismatch when developing parachain apps. Specifically, after the [Polkadot Technical fellowship](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship/){target=\_blank} proposes a runtime upgrade for Polkadot, this TestNet is updated, giving a period where the TestNet will be ahead of Polkadot to allow for testing.

## Polkadot

The [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.com/){target=\_blank} is a blockchain that serves as the central hub of a heterogeneous blockchain network. It serves the role of the [relay chain](#relay-chain) and provides shared infrastructure and security to support [parachains](#parachain).

## Polkadot Cloud

Polkadot Cloud is a platform for deploying resilient, customizable and scalable Web3 applications through Polkadot's functionality. It encompasses the wider Polkadot network infrastructure and security layer where parachains operate. The platform enables users to launch Ethereum-compatible chains, build specialized blockchains, and flexibly manage computing resources through on-demand or bulk coretime purchases. Initially launched with basic parachain functionality, Polkadot Cloud has evolved to offer enhanced flexibility with features like coretime, elastic scaling, and async backing for improved performance.

## Polkadot Hub

Polkadot Hub is a Layer 1 platform that serves as the primary entry point to the Polkadot ecosystem, providing essential functionality without requiring parachain deployment. It offers core services including smart contracts, identity management, staking, governance, and interoperability with other ecosystems, making it simple and fast for both builders and users to get started in Web3.

## PolkaVM

PolkaVM is a custom virtual machine optimized for performance, leveraging a RISC-V-based architecture to support Solidity and any language that compiles to RISC-V. It is specifically designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling smart contract deployment and execution.

## Relay Chain

Relay chains are blockchains that provide shared infrastructure and security to the [parachains](#parachain) in the network. In addition to providing [consensus](#consensus) capabilities, relay chains allow parachains to communicate and exchange digital assets without needing to trust one another.

## Rococo

A [parachain](#parachain) test network for the Polkadot network. The [Rococo](#rococo) network is a Polkadot SDK-based blockchain with an October 14, 2024 deprecation date. Development teams are encouraged to use the Paseo TestNet instead.

## Runtime

The runtime represents the [state transition function](#state-transition-function-stf) for a blockchain. In Polkadot SDK, the runtime is stored as a [Wasm](#webassembly-wasm) binary in the chain state. The Runtime is stored under a unique state key and can be modified during the execution of the state transition function.

## Slot

A fixed, equal interval of time used by consensus engines such as [Aura](#authority-round-aura) and [BABE](#blind-assignment-of-blockchain-extension-babe). In each slot, a subset of [authorities](#authority) is permitted, or obliged, to [author](#block-author) a block.

## Sovereign Account

The unique account identifier for each chain in the relay chain ecosystem. It is often used in cross-consensus (XCM) interactions to sign XCM messages sent to the relay chain or other chains in the ecosystem.

The sovereign account for each chain is a root-level account that can only be accessed using the Sudo pallet or through governance. The account identifier is calculated by concatenating the Blake2 hash of a specific text string and the registered parachain identifier.

## SS58 Address Format

A public key address based on the Bitcoin [`Base-58-check`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding){target=\_blank} encoding. Each Polkadot SDK SS58 address uses a `base-58` encoded value to identify a specific account on a specific Polkadot SDK-based chain

The [canonical `ss58-registry`](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry){target=\_blank} provides additional details about the address format used by different Polkadot SDK-based chains, including the network prefix and website used for different networks

## State Transition Function (STF)

The logic of a blockchain that determines how the state changes when a block is processed. In Polkadot SDK, the state transition function is effectively equivalent to the [runtime](#runtime).

## Storage Item

[FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities) primitives that provide type-safe data persistence capabilities to the [runtime](#runtime).
Learn more in the [storage items](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/storage/types/index.html){target=\_blank} reference document in the Polkadot SDK.

## Substrate

A flexible framework for building modular, efficient, and upgradeable blockchains. Substrate is written in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language and is maintained by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/){target=\_blank}.

## Transaction

An [extrinsic](#extrinsic) that includes a signature that can be used to verify the account authorizing it inherently or via [signed extensions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/signed_extensions/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## Transaction Era

A definable period expressed as a range of block numbers during which a transaction can be included in a block.
Transaction eras are used to protect against transaction replay attacks if an account is reaped and its replay-protecting nonce is reset to zero.

## Trie (Patricia Merkle Tree)

A data structure used to represent sets of key-value pairs and enables the items in the data set to be stored and retrieved using a cryptographic hash. Because incremental changes to the data set result in a new hash, retrieving data is efficient even if the data set is very large. With this data structure, you can also prove whether the data set includes any particular key-value pair without access to the entire data set.

In Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, state is stored in a trie data structure that supports the efficient creation of incremental digests. This trie is exposed to the [runtime](#runtime) as [a simple key/value map](#storage-item) where both keys and values can be arbitrary byte arrays.

## Validator

A validator is a node that participates in the consensus mechanism of the network. Its roles include block production, transaction validation, network integrity, and security maintenance.

## WebAssembly (Wasm)

An execution architecture that allows for the efficient, platform-neutral expression of
deterministic, machine-executable logic.

[Wasm](https://webassembly.org/){target=\_blank} can be compiled from many languages, including
the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language. Polkadot SDK-based chains use a Wasm binary to provide portable [runtimes](#runtime) that can be included as part of the chain's state.

## Weight

A convention used in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains to measure and manage the time it takes to validate a block.
Polkadot SDK defines one unit of weight as one picosecond of execution time on reference hardware.

The maximum block weight should be equivalent to one-third of the target block time with an allocation of one-third each for:

- Block construction
- Network propagation
- Import and verification

By defining weights, you can trade-off the number of transactions per second and the hardware required to maintain the target block time appropriate for your use case. Weights are defined in the runtime, meaning you can tune them using runtime updates to keep up with hardware and software improvements.

## Westend

Westend is a Parity-maintained, Polkadot SDK-based blockchain that serves as a test network for the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network.

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/parachains-integrations-indexers.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/parachains/integrations/indexers/
- Summary: Discover blockchain indexers. Enhance data access, enable fast and complex queries, and optimize blockchain data for seamless app performance.

# Indexers

## The Challenge of Blockchain Data Access

Blockchain data is inherently sequential and distributed, with information stored chronologically across numerous blocks. While retrieving data from a single block through JSON-RPC API calls is straightforward, more complex queries that span multiple blocks present significant challenges:

- Data is scattered and unorganized across the blockchain.
- Retrieving large datasets can take days or weeks to sync.
- Complex operations (like aggregations, averages, or cross-chain queries) require additional processing.
- Direct blockchain queries can impact dApp performance and responsiveness.

## What is a Blockchain Indexer?

A blockchain indexer is a specialized infrastructure tool that processes, organizes, and stores blockchain data in an optimized format for efficient querying. Think of it as a search engine for blockchain data that:

- Continuously monitors the blockchain for new blocks and transactions.
- Processes and categorizes this data according to predefined schemas.
- Stores the processed data in an easily queryable database.
- Provides efficient APIs (typically [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/){target=\_blank}) for data retrieval.

## Indexer Implementations

Page Title: Install Polkadot SDK

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/parachains-install-polkadot-sdk.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/
- Summary: Install all required Polkadot SDK dependencies, set up the SDK itself, and verify that it runs correctly on your machine.

# Install Polkadot SDK

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the Polkadot SDK on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The installation process consists of two main parts:

- **Installing dependencies**: Setting up Rust, required system packages, and development tools.
- **Building the Polkadot SDK**: Cloning and compiling the Polkadot SDK repository.

Follow the appropriate section for your operating system to ensure all necessary tools are installed and configured properly.

## Install Dependencies: macOS

You can install Rust and set up a Substrate development environment on Apple macOS computers with Intel or Apple M1 processors.

### Before You Begin {: #before-you-begin-mac-os }

Before you install Rust and set up your development environment on macOS, verify that your computer meets the following basic requirements:

- Operating system version is 10.7 Lion or later.
- Processor speed of at least 2 GHz. Note that 3 GHz is recommended.
- Memory of at least 8 GB RAM. Note that 16 GB is recommended.
- Storage of at least 10 GB of available space.
- Broadband Internet connection.

### Install Homebrew

In most cases, you should use Homebrew to install and manage packages on macOS computers. If you don't already have Homebrew installed on your local computer, you should download and install it before continuing.

To install Homebrew:

1. Open the Terminal application.
2. Download and install Homebrew by running the following command:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    ```

3. Verify Homebrew has been successfully installed by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew --version
    ```

    The command displays output similar to the following:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
      <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>brew --version</span>
      <span data-ty>Homebrew 4.3.15</span>
    </div>

### Support for Apple Silicon

Protobuf must be installed before the build process can begin. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

### Install Required Packages and Rust {: #install-required-packages-and-rust-mac-os }

Because the blockchain requires standard cryptography to support the generation of public/private key pairs and the validation of transaction signatures, you must also have a package that provides cryptography, such as `openssl`.

To install `openssl` and the Rust toolchain on macOS:

1. Open the Terminal application.
2. Ensure you have an updated version of Homebrew by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew update
    ```

3. Install the `openssl` package by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install openssl
    ```

4. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

5. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.
6. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

    ```bash
    source ~/.cargo/env
    ```

7. Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable
    rustup update
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    rustup component add rust-src
    ```

8. Install `cmake` using the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install cmake
    ```

9. Proceed to [Build the Polkadot SDK](#build-the-polkadot-sdk).

## Install Dependencies: Linux

Rust supports most Linux distributions. Depending on the specific distribution and version of the operating system you use, you might need to add some software dependencies to your environment. In general, your development environment should include a linker or a C-compatible compiler, such as `clang`, and an appropriate integrated development environment (IDE).

### Before You Begin {: #before-you-begin-linux }

Check the documentation for your operating system for information about the installed packages and how to download and install any additional packages you might need. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) to install the `build-essential` package:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

At a minimum, you need the following packages before you install Rust:

```text
clang curl git make
```

Because the blockchain requires standard cryptography to support the generation of public/private key pairs and the validation of transaction signatures, you must also have a package that provides cryptography, such as `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel`.

### Install Required Packages and Rust {: #install-required-packages-and-rust-linux }

To install the Rust toolchain on Linux:

1. Open a terminal shell.
2. Check the packages installed on the local computer by running the appropriate package management command for your Linux distribution.
3. Add any package dependencies you are missing to your local development environment by running the appropriate package management command for your Linux distribution:

    === "Ubuntu"

        ```bash
        sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev protobuf-compiler
        ```

    === "Debian"

        ```sh
        sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
        ```

    === "Arch"

        ```sh
        pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
        ```

    === "Fedora"

        ```sh
        sudo dnf update
        sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
        ```

    === "OpenSUSE"

        ```sh
        sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
        ```

    Remember that different distributions might use different package managers and bundle packages in different ways. For example, depending on your installation selections, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server might have different packages and different requirements. However, the packages listed in the command-line examples are applicable to many common Linux distributions, including Debian, Linux Mint, MX Linux, and Elementary OS.

4. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

5. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.
6. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

    ```bash
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

7. Verify your installation by running the following command:

## Install Dependencies: Windows (WSL)

In general, UNIX-based operating systems—like macOS or Linux—provide a better development environment for building Substrate-based blockchains.

However, suppose your local computer uses Microsoft Windows instead of a UNIX-based operating system. In that case, you can configure it with additional software to make it a suitable development environment for building Substrate-based blockchains. To prepare a development environment on a Microsoft Windows computer, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to emulate a UNIX operating environment.

### Before You Begin {: #before-you-begin-windows-wls }

Before installing on Microsoft Windows, verify the following basic requirements:

- You have a computer running a supported Microsoft Windows operating system:
    - **For Windows desktop**: You must be running Microsoft Windows 10, version 2004 or later, or Microsoft Windows 11 to install WSL.
    - **For Windows server**: You must be running Microsoft Windows Server 2019, or later, to install WSL on a server operating system.
- You have a good internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local computer.

### Set Up Windows Subsystem for Linux

WSL enables you to emulate a Linux environment on a computer that uses the Windows operating system. The primary advantage of this approach for Substrate development is that you can use all of the code and command-line examples as described in the Substrate documentation. For example, you can run common commands—such as `ls` and `ps`—unmodified. By using WSL, you can avoid configuring a virtual machine image or a dual-boot operating system.

To prepare a development environment using WSL:

1. Check your Windows version and build number to see if WSL is enabled by default.

    If you have Microsoft Windows 10, version 2004 (Build 19041 and higher), or Microsoft Windows 11, WSL is available by default and you can continue to the next step.

    If you have an older version of Microsoft Windows installed, see the [WSL manual installation steps for older versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual){target=\_blank}. If you are installing on an older version of Microsoft Windows, you can download and install WLS 2 if your computer has Windows 10, version 1903 or higher.

2. Select **Windows PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** from the **Start** menu, right-click, then **Run as administrator**.

3. In the PowerShell or Command Prompt terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```

    This command enables the required WSL 2 components that are part of the Windows operating system, downloads the latest Linux kernel, and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution by default.

    If you want to review the other Linux distributions available, run the following command:

    ```bash
    wsl --list --online
    ```

4. After the distribution is downloaded, close the terminal.

5. Click the **Start** menu, select **Shut down or sign out**, then click **Restart** to restart the computer.

    Restarting the computer is required to start the installation of the Linux distribution. It can take a few minutes for the installation to complete after you restart.

    For more information about setting up WSL as a development environment, see the [Set up a WSL development environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment){target=\_blank} docs.

### Install Required Packages and Rust {: #install-required-packages-and-rust-windows-wls }

To install the Rust toolchain on WSL:

1. Click the **Start** menu, then select **Ubuntu**.
2. Type a UNIX user name to create a user account.
3. Type a password for your UNIX user, then retype the password to confirm it.
4. Download the latest updates for the Ubuntu distribution using the Ubuntu Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

5. Add the required packages for the Ubuntu distribution by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
    ```

6. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust for the Ubuntu distribution by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

7. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.

8. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

    ```bash
    source ~/.cargo/env
    ```

9. Verify your installation by running the following command:

    ```bash
    rustc --version
    ```

10. Configure the Rust toolchain to use the latest stable version as the default toolchain by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable
    rustup update
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    rustup component add rust-src
    ```

11. Proceed to [Build the Polkadot SDK](#build-the-polkadot-sdk).

## Build the Polkadot SDK

After installing all dependencies, you can now clone and compile the Polkadot SDK repository to verify your setup.

### Clone the Polkadot SDK

1. Clone the Polkadot SDK repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd polkadot-sdk
    ```

### Compile the Polkadot SDK

Compile the entire Polkadot SDK repository to ensure your environment is properly configured:

```bash
cargo build --release --locked
```

!!!note
    This initial compilation will take significant time, depending on your machine specifications. It compiles all components of the Polkadot SDK to verify your toolchain is correctly configured.

### Verify the Build

Once the build completes successfully, verify the installation by checking the compiled binaries:

```bash
ls target/release
```

You should see several binaries, including:

- `polkadot`: The Polkadot relay chain node.
- `polkadot-parachain`: The parachain collator node.
- `polkadot-omni-node`:The omni node for running parachains.
- `substrate-node`: The kitchensink node with many pre-configured pallets.

Verify the Polkadot binary works by checking its version:

```bash
./target/release/polkadot --version
```

This should display version information similar to:

```bash
polkadot 1.16.0-1234abcd567
```

If you see the version output without errors, your development environment is correctly configured and ready for Polkadot SDK development!

## Optional: Run the Kitchensink Node

The Polkadot SDK includes a feature-rich node called "kitchensink" located at `substrate/bin/node`. This node comes pre-configured with many pallets and features from the Polkadot SDK, making it an excellent reference for exploring capabilities and understanding how different components work together.

!!!note
    If you've already compiled the Polkadot SDK in the previous step, the `substrate-node` binary is already built and ready to use. You can skip directly to running the node.

### Run the Kitchensink Node in Development Mode

From the `polkadot-sdk` root directory, start the kitchensink node in development mode:

```bash
./target/release/substrate-node --dev
```

The `--dev` flag enables development mode, which:

- Runs a single-node development chain.
- Produces and finalizes blocks automatically.
- Uses pre-configured development accounts (Alice, Bob, etc.).
- Deletes all data when stopped, ensuring a clean state on restart.


You should see log output indicating the node is running and producing blocks, with increasing block numbers after `finalized`.

### Interact with the Kitchensink Node

The kitchensink node is accessible at `ws://localhost:9944`. Open [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} in your browser to explore its features and connect to the local node.

1. Click the network icon in the top left corner.
2. Scroll to **Development** and select **Local Node**.
3. Click **Switch** to connect to your local node.

![](/images/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/install-polkadot-sdk-1.webp)

Once connected, the interface updates its color scheme to indicate a successful connection to the local node.

![](/images/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/install-polkadot-sdk-2.webp)

You can now explore the various pallets and features included in the kitchensink node, making it a valuable reference as you develop your own blockchain applications.

To stop the node, press `Control-C` in the terminal.

- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/parachains/interoperability/
- Summary: Explore the importance of interoperability in the Polkadot ecosystem, covering XCM, bridges, and cross-chain communication.

# Interoperability

## Introduction

Interoperability lies at the heart of the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling communication and collaboration across a diverse range of blockchains. By bridging the gaps between parachains, relay chains, and even external networks, Polkadot unlocks the potential for truly decentralized applications, efficient resource sharing, and scalable solutions.

Polkadot’s design ensures that blockchains can transcend their individual limitations by working together as part of a unified system. This cooperative architecture is what sets Polkadot apart in the blockchain landscape.

## Why Interoperability Matters

The blockchain ecosystem is inherently fragmented. Different blockchains excel in specialized domains such as finance, gaming, or supply chain management, but these chains function in isolation without interoperability. This lack of connectivity stifles the broader utility of blockchain technology.

Interoperability solves this problem by enabling blockchains to:

- **Collaborate across networks**: Chains can interact to share assets, functionality, and data, creating synergies that amplify their individual strengths.
- **Achieve greater scalability**: Specialized chains can offload tasks to others, optimizing performance and resource utilization.
- **Expand use-case potential**: Cross-chain applications can leverage features from multiple blockchains, unlocking novel user experiences and solutions.

In the Polkadot ecosystem, interoperability transforms a collection of isolated chains into a cohesive, efficient network, pushing the boundaries of what blockchains can achieve together.

## Key Mechanisms for Interoperability

At the core of Polkadot's cross-chain collaboration are foundational technologies designed to break down barriers between networks. These mechanisms empower blockchains to communicate, share resources, and operate as a cohesive ecosystem.

### Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM): The Backbone of Communication

Polkadot's Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) is the standard framework for interaction between parachains, relay chains, and, eventually, external blockchains. XCM provides a trustless, secure messaging format for exchanging assets, sharing data, and executing cross-chain operations.

Through XCM, decentralized applications can:

- Transfer tokens and other assets across chains.
- Coordinate complex workflows that span multiple blockchains.
- Enable seamless user experiences where underlying blockchain differences are invisible.
- XCM exemplifies Polkadot’s commitment to creating a robust and interoperable ecosystem.

For further information about XCM, check the [Get Started with XCM](/parachains/interoperability/get-started/){target=\_blank} article.

### Bridges: Connecting External Networks

While XCM enables interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem, bridges extend this functionality to external blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. By connecting these networks, bridges allow Polkadot-based chains to access external liquidity, additional functionalities, and broader user bases.

With bridges, developers and users gain the ability to:

- Integrate external assets into Polkadot-based applications.
- Combine the strengths of Polkadot’s scalability with the liquidity of other networks.
- Facilitate accurate multi-chain applications that transcend ecosystem boundaries.

For more information about bridges in the Polkadot ecosystem, see the [Bridge Hub](/reference/polkadot-hub/bridging/){target=\_blank} guide.

## The Polkadot Advantage

Polkadot was purpose-built for interoperability. Unlike networks that add interoperability as an afterthought, Polkadot integrates it as a fundamental design principle. This approach offers several distinct advantages:

- **Developer empowerment**: Polkadot’s interoperability tools allow developers to build applications that leverage multiple chains’ capabilities without added complexity.
- **Enhanced ecosystem collaboration**: Chains in Polkadot can focus on their unique strengths while contributing to the ecosystem’s overall growth.
- **Future-proofing blockchain**: By enabling seamless communication, Polkadot ensures its ecosystem can adapt to evolving demands and technologies.

## Looking Ahead

Polkadot’s vision of interoperability extends beyond technical functionality, representing a shift towards a more collaborative blockchain landscape. By enabling chains to work together, Polkadot fosters innovation, efficiency, and accessibility, paving the way for a decentralized future where blockchains are not isolated competitors but interconnected collaborators.

Page Title: Light Clients

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/reference-tools-light-clients.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/tools/light-clients/
- Summary: Light clients enable secure and efficient blockchain interaction without running a full node. Learn everything you need to know about light clients on Polkadot.

# Light Clients

## Introduction

Light clients enable secure and efficient blockchain interaction without running a full node. They provide a trust-minimized alternative to JSON-RPC by verifying data through cryptographic proofs rather than blindly trusting remote nodes.

This guide covers:

- What light clients are and how they work.
- Their advantages compared to full nodes and JSON-RPC.
- Available implementations in the Polkadot ecosystem.
- How to use light clients in your applications.

Light clients are particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments and applications requiring secure, decentralized blockchain access without the overhead of maintaining full nodes.

!!!note "Light node or light client?"
    The terms _light node_ and _light client_ are interchangeable. Both refer to a blockchain client that syncs without downloading the entire blockchain state. All nodes in a blockchain network are fundamentally clients, engaging in peer-to-peer communication.

## Light Clients Workflow

Unlike JSON-RPC interfaces, where an application must maintain a list of providers or rely on a single node, light clients are not limited to or dependent on a single node. They use cryptographic proofs to verify the blockchain's state, ensuring it is up-to-date and accurate. By verifying only block headers, light clients avoid syncing the entire state, making them ideal for resource-constrained environments.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
DAPP([dApp])-- Query Account Info -->LC([Light Client])
LC -- Request --> FN(((Full Node)))
LC -- Response --> DAPP
FN -- Response (validated via Merkle proof) --> LC
```

In the diagram above, the decentralized application queries on-chain account information through the light client. The light client runs as part of the application and requires minimal memory and computational resources. It uses Merkle proofs to verify the state retrieved from a full node in a trust-minimized manner. Polkadot-compatible light clients utilize [warp syncing](https://spec.polkadot.network/sect-lightclient#sect-sync-warp-lightclient){target=\_blank}, which downloads only block headers.

Light clients can quickly verify the blockchain's state, including [GRANDPA finality](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#grandpa){target=\_blank} justifications.

!!!note "What does it mean to be trust-minimized?"
    _Trust-minimized_ means that the light client does not need to fully trust the full node from which it retrieves the state. This is achieved through the use of Merkle proofs, which allow the light client to verify the correctness of the state by checking the Merkle tree root.

## JSON-RPC and Light Client Comparison

Another common method of communication between a user interface (UI) and a node is through the JSON-RPC protocol. Generally, the UI retrieves information from the node, fetches network or [pallet](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#pallet){target=\_blank} data, and interacts with the blockchain. This is typically done in one of two ways:

- **User-controlled nodes**: The UI connects to a node client installed on the user's machine.
    - These nodes are secure, but installation and maintenance can be inconvenient.
- **Publicly accessible nodes**: The UI connects to a third-party-owned publicly accessible node client.
    - These nodes are convenient but centralized and less secure. Applications must maintain a list of backup nodes in case the primary node becomes unavailable.

While light clients still communicate with [full nodes](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#full-node), they offer significant advantages for applications requiring a secure alternative to running a full node:

| Full Node                                                                                       | Light Client                                                   |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Fully verifies all blocks of the chain                                                          | Verifies only the authenticity of blocks                       |
| Stores previous block data and the chain's storage in a database                                | Does not require a database                                    |
| Installation, maintenance, and execution are resource-intensive and require technical expertise | No installation is typically included as part of the application |

## Using Light Clients

The [`smoldot`](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=\_blank} client is the cornerstone of light client implementation for Polkadot SDK-based chains. It provides the primitives needed to build light clients and is also integrated into libraries such as [PAPI](#papi-light-client-support).

### PAPI Light Client Support

The [Polkadot API (PAPI)](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/papi){target=\_blank} library natively supports light client configurations powered by [`smoldot`](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=\_blank}. This allows developers to connect to multiple chains simultaneously using a light client.

### Substrate Connect - Browser Extension

The [Substrate Connect browser extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@substrate/connect-extension-protocol){target=\_blank} enables end-users to interact with applications connected to multiple blockchains or to connect their own blockchains to supported applications.

Establishing a sufficient number of peers can be challenging due to browser limitations on WebSocket connections from HTTPS pages, as many nodes require TLS. The Substrate Connect browser extension addresses this limitation by keeping chains synced in the background, enabling faster application performance.

Substrate Connect automatically detects whether the user has the extension installed. If not, an in-page Wasm light client is created for them.

The progression follows a well-defined path, starting from local environments and advancing through TestNets, ultimately reaching the Polkadot MainNet. The diagram below outlines the typical progression of the Polkadot development cycle:

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1[Local] --> id2[Westend] --> id4[Kusama] --> id5[Polkadot]  
    id1[Local] --> id3[Paseo] --> id5[Polkadot] 
```

This flow ensures developers can thoroughly test and iterate without risking real tokens or affecting production networks. Testing tools like [Chopsticks](#chopsticks) and various TestNets make it easier to experiment safely before releasing to production.

A typical journey through the Polkadot core protocol development process might look like this:

1. **Local development node**: Development starts in a local environment, where developers can create, test, and iterate on upgrades or new features using a local development node. This stage allows rapid experimentation in an isolated setup without any external dependencies.

2. **Westend**: After testing locally, upgrades are deployed to [Westend](#westend), Polkadot's primary TestNet. Westend simulates real-world conditions without using real tokens, making it the ideal place for rigorous feature testing before moving on to production networks.

3. **Kusama**: Once features have passed extensive testing on Westend, they move to Kusama, Polkadot's experimental and fast-moving "canary" network. Kusama operates as a high-fidelity testing ground with actual economic incentives, giving developers insights into how their features will perform in a real-world environment.

4. **Polkadot**: After passing tests on Westend and Kusama, features are considered ready for deployment to Polkadot, the live production network.

    In addition, parachain developers can leverage local TestNets like [Zombienet](#zombienet) and deploy upgrades on parachain TestNets.

5. **Paseo**: For parachain and dApp developers, Paseo serves as a community-run TestNet that mirrors Polkadot's runtime. Like Westend for core protocol development, Paseo provides a testing ground for parachain development without affecting live networks.

!!!note
    The Rococo TestNet deprecation date was October 14, 2024. Teams should use Westend for Polkadot protocol and feature testing and Paseo for chain development-related testing.

## Polkadot Development Networks

Development and testing are crucial to building robust dApps and parachains and performing network upgrades within the Polkadot ecosystem. To achieve this, developers can leverage various networks and tools that provide a risk-free environment for experimentation and validation before deploying features to live networks. These networks help avoid the costs and risks associated with real tokens, enabling testing for functionalities like governance, cross-chain messaging, and runtime upgrades.

## Kusama Network

Kusama is the experimental version of Polkadot, designed for developers who want to move quickly and test their applications in a real-world environment with economic incentives. Kusama serves as a production-grade testing ground where developers can deploy features and upgrades with the pressure of game theory and economics in mind. It mirrors Polkadot but operates as a more flexible space for innovation.

The native token for Kusama is KSM. For more information about KSM, visit the [Native Assets](https://wiki.polkadot.com/kusama/kusama-getting-started/){target=\_blank} page.

## Test Networks

The following test networks provide controlled environments for testing upgrades and new features. TestNet tokens are available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}.

### Westend

Westend is Polkadot's primary permanent TestNet. Unlike temporary test networks, Westend is not reset to the genesis block, making it an ongoing environment for testing Polkadot core features. Managed by Parity Technologies, Westend ensures that developers can test features in a real-world simulation without using actual tokens.

The native token for Westend is WND. More details about WND can be found on the [Native Assets](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-dot/#__tabbed_2_2){target=\_blank} page.

### Paseo

[Paseo](https://github.com/paseo-network){target=\_blank} is a community-managed TestNet designed for parachain and dApp developers. It mirrors Polkadot's runtime and is maintained by Polkadot community members. Paseo provides a dedicated space for parachain developers to test their applications in a Polkadot-like environment without the risks associated with live networks.

The native token for Paseo is PAS. Additional information on PAS is available on the [Native Assets](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-dot/#__tabbed_2_1){target=\_blank} page.

## Local Test Networks

Local test networks are an essential part of the development cycle for blockchain developers using the Polkadot SDK. They allow for fast, iterative testing in controlled, private environments without connecting to public TestNets. Developers can quickly spin up local instances to experiment, debug, and validate their code before deploying to larger TestNets like Westend or Paseo. Two key tools for local network testing are Zombienet and Chopsticks.

### Zombienet

[Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=\_blank} is a flexible testing framework for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. It enables developers to create and manage ephemeral, short-lived networks. This feature makes Zombienet particularly useful for quick iterations, as it allows you to run multiple local networks concurrently, mimicking different runtime conditions. Whether you're developing a parachain or testing your custom blockchain logic, Zombienet gives you the tools to automate local testing.

Key features of Zombienet include:

- Creating dynamic, local networks with different configurations.
- Running parachains and relay chains in a simulated environment.
- Efficient testing of network components like cross-chain messaging and governance.

Zombienet is ideal for developers looking to test quickly and thoroughly before moving to more resource-intensive public TestNets.

### Chopsticks

[Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks){target=\_blank} is a tool designed to create forks of Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, allowing developers to interact with network forks as part of their testing process. This capability makes Chopsticks a powerful option for testing upgrades, runtime changes, or cross-chain applications in a forked network environment.

Key features of Chopsticks include:

- Forking live Polkadot SDK-based blockchains for isolated testing.
- Simulating cross-chain messages in a private, controlled setup.
- Debugging network behavior by interacting with the fork in real-time.

Chopsticks provides a controlled environment for developers to safely explore the effects of runtime changes. It ensures that network behavior is tested and verified before upgrades are deployed to live networks.

- Summary: Learn how Polkadot SDK-based nodes function, how the client and runtime are separated, and how they communicate using SCALE-encoded data.

# Node and Runtime

## Introduction

Every blockchain platform relies on a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, that communicate with each other about transactions and blocks. In this context, a node refers to the software running on the connected devices rather than the physical or virtual machines in the network.

Polkadot SDK-based nodes consist of two main components, each with distinct responsibilities: the client (also called node) and the runtime.

If the system were a monolithic protocol, any modification would require updating the entire system. Instead, Polkadot achieves true upgradeability by defining an immutable meta-protocol (the client) and a protocol (the runtime) that can be upgraded independently.

This separation gives the [Polkadot Relay Chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain){target=\_blank} and all connected [parachains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/parachains){target=\_blank} an evolutionary advantage over other blockchain platforms.

## Architectural Principles

The Polkadot SDK-based blockchain architecture is fundamentally built on two distinct yet interconnected components:

- Client (Meta-protocol):
    - Handles the foundational infrastructure of the blockchain.
    - Manages runtime execution, networking, consensus, and other off-chain components.
    - Provides an immutable base layer that ensures network stability.
    - Upgradable only through hard forks.

- Runtime (Protocol):
    - Defines the blockchain's state transition logic.
    - Determines the specific rules and behaviors of the blockchain.
    - Compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) for platform-independent execution.
    - Capable of being upgraded without network-wide forking.

### Advantages of this Architecture

- **Forkless upgrades**: Runtime can be updated without disrupting the entire network.
- **Modularity**: Clear separation allows independent development of client and runtime.
- **Flexibility**: Enables rapid iteration and evolution of blockchain logic.
- **Performance**: WebAssembly compilation provides efficient, cross-platform execution.

## Node (Client)

The node, also known as the client, is the core component responsible for executing the Wasm runtime and orchestrating various essential blockchain components. It ensures the correct execution of the state transition function and manages multiple critical subsystems, including:

- **Wasm execution**: Runs the blockchain runtime, which defines the state transition rules.
- **Database management**: Stores blockchain data.
- **Networking**: Facilitates peer-to-peer communication, block propagation, and transaction gossiping.
- **Transaction pool (Mempool)**: Manages pending transactions before they are included in a block.
- **Consensus mechanism**: Ensures agreement on the blockchain state across nodes.
- **RPC services**: Provides external interfaces for applications and users to interact with the node.

## Runtime

The runtime is more than just a set of rules. It's the fundamental logic engine that defines a blockchain's entire behavior. In Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, the runtime represents a complete, self-contained description of the blockchain's state transition function.

### Characteristics

The runtime is distinguished by three key characteristics:

- **Business logic**: Defines the complete application-specific blockchain behavior.
- **WebAssembly compilation**: Ensures platform-independent, secure execution.
- **On-chain storage**: Stored within the blockchain's state, allowing dynamic updates.

### Key Functions

The runtime performs several critical functions, such as:

- Define state transition rules.
- Implement blockchain-specific logic.
- Manage account interactions.
- Control transaction processing.
- Define governance mechanisms.
- Handle custom pallets and modules.

## Communication Between Node and Runtime

The client and runtime communicate exclusively using [SCALE-encoded](/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/data-encoding){target=\_blank} communication. This ensures efficient and compact data exchange between the two components.

### Runtime APIs

The Runtime API consists of well-defined functions and constants a client assumes are implemented in the Runtime Wasm blob. These APIs enable the client to interact with the runtime to execute blockchain operations and retrieve information. The client invokes these APIs to:

- Build, execute, and finalize blocks.
- Access metadata.
- Access consensus related information.
- Handle transaction execution.

### Host Functions

During execution, the runtime can access certain external client functionalities via host functions. The specific functions the client exposes allow the runtime to perform operations outside the WebAssembly domain. Host functions enable the runtime to:

- Perform cryptographic operations.
- Access the current blockchain state.
- Handle storage modifications.
- Allocate memory.

- Summary: Discover Polkadot’s cutting-edge OpenGov system, enabling transparent, decentralized decision-making through direct democracy and flexible governance tracks.

# On-Chain Governance 

## Introduction

Polkadot’s governance system exemplifies decentralized decision-making, empowering its community of stakeholders to shape the network’s future through active participation. The latest evolution, OpenGov, builds on Polkadot’s foundation by providing a more inclusive and efficient governance model.

This guide will explain the principles and structure of OpenGov and walk you through its key components, such as Origins, Tracks, and Delegation. You will learn about improvements over earlier governance systems, including streamlined voting processes and enhanced stakeholder participation.

With OpenGov, Polkadot achieves a flexible, scalable, and democratic governance framework that allows multiple proposals to proceed simultaneously, ensuring the network evolves in alignment with its community's needs.

## Governance Evolution

Polkadot’s governance journey began with [Governance V1](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#governance-summary){target=\_blank}, a system that proved effective in managing treasury funds and protocol upgrades. However, it faced limitations, such as:

- Slow voting cycles, causing delays in decision-making.
- Inflexibility in handling multiple referendums, restricting scalability.

To address these challenges, Polkadot introduced OpenGov, a governance model designed for greater inclusivity, efficiency, and scalability. OpenGov replaces the centralized structures of Governance V1, such as the Council and Technical Committee, with a fully decentralized and dynamic framework.

For a full comparison of the historic and current governance models, visit the [Gov1 vs. Polkadot OpenGov](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#gov1-vs-polkadot-opengov){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot Wiki.

## OpenGov Key Features

OpenGov transforms Polkadot’s governance into a decentralized, stakeholder-driven model, eliminating centralized decision-making bodies like the Council. Key enhancements include:

- **Decentralization**: Shifts all decision-making power to the public, ensuring a more democratic process.
- **Enhanced delegation**: Allows users to delegate their votes to trusted experts across specific governance tracks.
- **Simultaneous referendums**: Multiple proposals can progress at once, enabling faster decision-making.
- **Polkadot Technical Fellowship**: A broad, community-driven group replacing the centralized Technical Committee.

This new system ensures Polkadot governance remains agile and inclusive, even as the ecosystem grows.

## Origins and Tracks

In OpenGov, origins and tracks are central to managing proposals and votes.

- **Origin**: Determines the authority level of a proposal (e.g., Treasury, Root) which decides the track of all referendums from that origin.
- **Track**: Define the procedural flow of a proposal, such as voting duration, approval thresholds, and enactment timelines.

Developers must be aware that referendums from different origins and tracks will take varying amounts of time to reach approval and enactment. The [Polkadot Technical Fellowship](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship/){target=\_blank} has the option to shorten this timeline by whitelisting a proposal and allowing it to be enacted through the [Whitelist Caller](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins/#whitelisted-caller){target=\_blank} origin.

Visit [Origins and Tracks Info](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#origins-and-tracks){target=\_blank} for details on current origins and tracks, associated terminology, and parameters.

## Referendums

In OpenGov, anyone can submit a referendum, fostering an open and participatory system. The timeline for a referendum depends on the privilege level of the origin with more significant changes offering more time for community voting and participation before enactment. 

The timeline for an individual referendum includes four distinct periods:

- **Lead-in**: A minimum amount of time to allow for community participation, available room in the origin, and payment of the decision deposit. Voting is open during this period.
- **Decision**: Voting continues.
- **Confirmation**: Referendum must meet [approval and support](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#approval-and-support){target=\_blank} criteria during entire period to avoid rejection.
- **Enactment**: Changes approved by the referendum are executed.

### Vote on Referendums

Voters can vote with their tokens on each referendum. Polkadot uses a voluntary token locking mechanism, called conviction voting, as a way for voters to increase their voting power. A token holder signals they have a stronger preference for approving a proposal based upon their willingness to lock up tokens. Longer voluntary token locks are seen as a signal of continual approval and translate to increased voting weight.

See [Voting on a Referendum](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#voting-on-a-referendum){target=\_blank} for a deeper look at conviction voting and related token locks.

### Delegate Voting Power

The OpenGov system also supports multi-role delegations, allowing token holders to assign their voting power on different tracks to entities with expertise in those areas. 

For example, if a token holder lacks the technical knowledge to evaluate proposals on the [Root track](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins/#root){target=\_blank}, they can delegate their voting power for that track to an expert they trust to vote in the best interest of the network. This ensures informed decision-making across tracks while maintaining flexibility for token holders.

Visit [Multirole Delegation](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#multirole-delegation){target=\_blank} for more details on delegating voting power.

### Cancel a Referendum

Polkadot OpenGov has two origins for rejecting ongoing referendums: 

- [**Referendum Canceller**](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins/#referendum-canceller){target=\_blank}: Cancels an active referendum when non-malicious errors occur and refunds the deposits to the originators.
- [**Referendum Killer**](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins/#referendum-killer){target=\_blank}: Used for urgent, malicious cases this origin instantly terminates an active referendum and slashes deposits.

See [Cancelling, Killing, and Blacklisting](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#cancelling-killing--blacklisting){target=\_blank} for additional information on rejecting referendums.

# Oracles

## What is a Blockchain Oracle?

Oracles enable blockchains to access external data sources. Since blockchains operate as isolated networks, they cannot natively interact with external systems - this limitation is known as the "blockchain oracle problem." Oracles solves this by extracting data from external sources (like APIs, IoT devices, or other blockchains), validating it, and submitting it on-chain.

While simple oracle implementations may rely on a single trusted provider, more sophisticated solutions use decentralized networks where multiple providers stake assets and reach consensus on data validity. Typical applications include DeFi price feeds, weather data for insurance contracts, and cross-chain asset verification.

## Oracle Implementations

- Summary: Learn how Polkadot SDK’s FRAME framework simplifies blockchain development with modular pallets and support libraries for efficient runtime design.

# Customize Your Runtime

## Introduction

A blockchain runtime is more than just a fixed set of rules—it's a dynamic foundation that you can shape to match your specific needs. With Polkadot SDK's [FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html){target=\_blank}, customizing your runtime is straightforward and modular. Instead of building everything from scratch, you combine pre-built pallets with your own custom logic to create a runtime suited to your blockchain's purpose.



This overview explains how runtime customization works, introduces the building blocks you'll use, and guides you through the key patterns for extending your runtime.

## Understanding Your Runtime

The runtime is the core logic of your blockchain—it processes transactions, manages state, and enforces the rules that govern your network. When a transaction arrives at your blockchain, the [`frame_executive`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_executive/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet receives it and routes it to the appropriate pallet for execution.

Think of your runtime as a collection of specialized modules, each handling a different aspect of your blockchain. Need token balances? Use the Balances pallet. Want governance? Add the Governance pallets. Need something custom? Create your own pallet. By mixing and matching these modules, you build a runtime that's efficient, secure, and tailored to your use case.

## Runtime Architecture

The following diagram shows how FRAME components work together to form your runtime:

![](/images/parachains/customize-runtime/index/frame-overview-01.webp)

The main components are:

- **`frame_executive`**: Routes all incoming transactions to the correct pallet for execution.
- **Pallets**: Domain-specific modules that implement your blockchain's features and business logic.
- **`frame_system`**: Provides core runtime primitives and storage.
- **`frame_support`**: Utilities and macros that simplify pallet development.

## Building Blocks: Pallets

[Pallets](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/pallet/index.html){target=\_blank} are the fundamental units of runtime customization. Each pallet encapsulates specific functionality and can be independently developed, tested, and integrated.

A pallet can implement virtually any blockchain feature you need:

- Expose new transactions that users can submit.
- Store data on-chain.
- Enforce business rules and validation logic.
- Emit events to notify users of state changes.
- Handle errors gracefully.

### Pre-Built Pallets vs. Custom Pallets

FRAME provides a comprehensive library of [pre-built pallets](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/polkadot-stable2506-2/substrate/frame){target=\_blank} for common blockchain features, including consensus, staking, balances, governance, and more. These pallets are battle-tested, optimized, and ready to use.

However, you're not limited to pre-built functionality. When pre-built pallets don't meet your needs, you can create custom pallets with entirely custom logic. The real power of FRAME is the flexibility to use pre-built modules for standard features while building your own for unique requirements.

### Pallet Structure

FRAME uses Rust macros extensively, allowing you to focus on your pallet's logic while the framework handles boilerplate and integration code.

A typical pallet looks like this:

```rust
pub use pallet::*;

#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
  use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
  use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

  #[pallet::pallet]
  #[pallet::generate_store(pub(super) trait Store)]
  pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

  #[pallet::config]  // snip
  #[pallet::event]   // snip
  #[pallet::error]   // snip
  #[pallet::storage] // snip
  #[pallet::call]    // snip
}
```

Every pallet can implement these core macros:

- **`#[frame_support::pallet]`**: Marks your module as a FRAME pallet.
- **`#[pallet::pallet]`**: Designates the struct that holds pallet metadata.
- **`#[pallet::config]`**: Defines configuration and associated types.
- **`#[pallet::event]`**: Defines events emitted by your pallet.
- **`#[pallet::error]`**: Defines error types your pallet can return.
- **`#[pallet::storage]`**: Defines on-chain storage items.
- **`#[pallet::call]`**: Defines dispatchable functions (transactions).

For a comprehensive reference, see the [`pallet_macros` documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## How Runtime Customization Works

Customizing your runtime typically follows these patterns:

**Adding Pre-Built Pallets**: Select pallets from the FRAME library and integrate them into your runtime configuration. This is the fastest way to add functionality.

**Creating Custom Pallets**: Write custom pallets for features that don't exist in the pre-built library. Custom pallets follow the same structure as pre-built ones and integrate seamlessly.

**Combining Multiple Pallets**: Layer multiple pallets together to create complex behaviors. Pallets can call each other and share storage when needed.

**Configuring Pallet Parameters**: Most pallets are configurable—you can adjust their behavior through configuration traits without modifying their code.

The following diagram illustrates how pallets combine to form a complete runtime:

![](/images/parachains/customize-runtime/index/frame-overview-02.webp)

## Starting Templates

The easiest way to begin customizing your runtime is with a starter template. These templates provide a pre-configured foundation so you can focus on customization rather than setup.

- **[Polkadot SDK Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template){target=\_blank}**: The recommended choice for most developers, it includes pre-configured pallets for common features (balances, block production, governance), a complete runtime setup, and built-in parachain consensus support. This template offers the best balance of features and learning opportunities.

- **[Polkadot SDK Minimal Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-minimal-template){target=\_blank}**: Provides a bare-bones runtime with only essential components. Choose this if you want maximum flexibility and prefer building from a clean slate.

- **[Polkadot SDK Solochain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/solochain){target=\_blank}**: Designed for building standalone blockchains with moderate features, simple consensus, and several core pallets. Use this if you want a sovereign blockchain independent of a relay chain.

- **[OpenZeppelin Runtime Templates](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates){target=\_blank}**: Provides security-focused configurations following industry best practices. The [generic-template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/tree/main/generic-template){target=\_blank} includes curated pallet selections and production-ready defaults—ideal if security is your top priority.

## Key Customization Scenarios

This section covers the most common customization patterns you'll encounter:

- **[Add Existing Pallets to Your Runtime](/parachains/customize-runtime/add-existing-pallets/)**: Integrate pre-built pallets from the FRAME library with minimal configuration.

- **[Add Multiple Instances of a Pallet](/parachains/customize-runtime/add-pallet-instances/)**: Run multiple instances of the same pallet with different configurations—useful for multi-token systems or parallel features.

- **[Add Smart Contract Functionality](/parachains/customize-runtime/add-smart-contract-functionality/)**: Enable smart contract execution on your parachain using Contracts pallets.

- **[Create Custom Pallets](/parachains/customize-runtime/pallet-development/create-a-pallet/)**: Build entirely custom pallets for features unique to your blockchain.

- **[Test Your Runtime](/parachains/customize-runtime/pallet-development/pallet-testing/)**: Unit test pallets and mock complete runtimes to ensure everything works correctly.

# Overview

## Introduction

Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol designed to support a multi-chain future by enabling secure communication and interoperability between different blockchains. Built as a Layer-0 protocol, Polkadot introduces innovations like application-specific Layer-1 chains ([parachains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/parachains/){targe=\_blank}), shared security through [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](/reference/glossary/#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos){target=\_blank}, and cross-chain interactions via its native [Cross-Consensus Messaging Format (XCM)](/parachains/interoperability/get-started/){target=\_blank}.

This guide covers key aspects of Polkadot’s architecture, including its high-level protocol structure, blockspace commoditization, and the role of its native token, DOT, in governance, staking, and resource allocation.

## Polkadot 1.0

Polkadot 1.0 represents the state of Polkadot as of 2023, coinciding with the release of [Polkadot runtime v1.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v1.0.0){target=\_blank}. This section will focus on Polkadot 1.0, along with philosophical insights into network resilience and blockspace.

As a Layer-0 blockchain, Polkadot contributes to the multi-chain vision through several key innovations and initiatives, including:

- **Application-specific Layer-1 blockchains (parachains)**: Polkadot's sharded network allows for parallel transaction processing, with shards that can have unique state transition functions, enabling custom-built L1 chains optimized for specific applications.

- **Shared security and scalability**: L1 chains connected to Polkadot benefit from its [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/pos-consensus/#nominated-proof-of-stake){target=\_blank} system, providing security out-of-the-box without the need to bootstrap their own.

- **Secure interoperability**: Polkadot's native interoperability enables seamless data and value exchange between parachains. This interoperability can also be used outside of the ecosystem for bridging with external networks.

- **Resilient infrastructure**: Decentralized and scalable, Polkadot ensures ongoing support for development and community initiatives via its on-chain [treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury/){target=\_blank} and governance.

- **Rapid L1 development**: The [Polkadot SDK](/reference/parachains/){target=\_blank} allows fast, flexible creation and deployment of Layer-1 chains.

- **Cultivating the next generation of Web3 developers**: Polkadot supports the growth of Web3 core developers through initiatives such as.

    - [EdX courses](https://www.edx.org/school/web3x){target=\_blank}
    - Rust and Substrate courses (coming soon)

### High-Level Architecture

Polkadot features a chain that serves as the central component of the system. This chain is depicted as a ring encircled by several parachains that are connected to it.

According to Polkadot's design, any blockchain that can compile to WebAssembly (Wasm) and adheres to the Parachains Protocol becomes a parachain on the Polkadot network.

Here’s a high-level overview of the Polkadot protocol architecture:

Parachains propose blocks to Polkadot validators, who check for availability and validity before finalizing them. With the relay chain providing security, collators—full nodes of parachains—can focus on their tasks without needing strong incentives.

The [Cross-Consensus Messaging Format (XCM)](/parachains/interoperability/get-started/){target=\_blank} allows parachains to exchange messages freely, leveraging the chain's security for trust-free communication.

In order to interact with chains that want to use their own finalization process (e.g., Bitcoin), Polkadot has [bridges](/reference/parachains/interoperability/#bridges-connecting-external-networks){target=\_blank} that offer two-way compatibility, meaning that transactions can be made between different parachains.

### Polkadot's Additional Functionalities

Historically, obtaining core slots on Polkadot chain relied upon crowdloans and auctions. Chain cores were leased through auctions for three-month periods, up to a maximum of two years. Crowdloans enabled users to securely lend funds to teams for lease deposits in exchange for pre-sale tokens, which is the only way to access slots on Polkadot 1.0. Auctions are now deprecated in favor of [coretime](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/coretime/){target=\_blank}.

Additionally, the chain handles [staking](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-staking/){target=\_blank}, [accounts](/reference/parachains/accounts/){target=\_blank}, balances, and [governance](/reference/governance/){target=\_blank}.

#### Agile Coretime

The new and more efficient way of obtaining core on Polkadot is to go through the process of purchasing coretime.

[Agile coretime](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/agile-coretime/){target=\_blank} improves the efficient use of Polkadot's network resources and offers economic flexibility for developers, extending Polkadot's capabilities far beyond the original vision outlined in the [whitepaper](https://polkadot.com/papers/Polkadot-whitepaper.pdf){target=\_blank}.

It enables parachains to purchase monthly "bulk" allocations of coretime (the time allocated for utilizing a core, measured in Polkadot relay chain blocks), ensuring heavy-duty parachains that can author a block every six seconds with [Asynchronous Backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} can reliably renew their coretime each month. Although six-second block times are now the default, parachains have the option of producing blocks less frequently.

Renewal orders are prioritized over new orders, offering stability against price fluctuations and helping parachains budget more effectively for project costs.

### Polkadot's Resilience

Decentralization is a vital component of blockchain networks, but it comes with trade-offs:

- An overly decentralized network may face challenges in reaching consensus and require significant energy to operate.
- Also, a network that achieves consensus quickly risks centralization, making it easier to manipulate or attack.

A network should be decentralized enough to prevent manipulative or malicious influence. In this sense, decentralization is a tool for achieving resilience.

Polkadot 1.0 currently achieves resilience through several strategies:

- **Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)**: Ensures that the stake per validator is maximized and evenly distributed among validators.

- **Decentralized nodes**: Designed to encourage operators to join the network. This program aims to expand and diversify the validators in the ecosystem who aim to become independent of the program during their term. Feel free to explore more about the program on the official [Decentralized Nodes](https://nodes.web3.foundation/){target=\_blank} page.

- **On-chain treasury and governance**: Known as [OpenGov](/reference/governance/){target=\_blank}, this system allows every decision to be made through public referenda, enabling any token holder to cast a vote.

### Polkadot's Blockspace

Polkadot 1.0’s design allows for the commoditization of blockspace.

Blockspace is a blockchain's capacity to finalize and commit operations, encompassing its security, computing, and storage capabilities. Its characteristics can vary across different blockchains, affecting security, flexibility, and availability.

- **Security**: Measures the robustness of blockspace in Proof of Stake (PoS) networks linked to the stake locked on validator nodes, the variance in stake among validators, and the total number of validators. It also considers social centralization (how many validators are owned by single operators) and physical centralization (how many validators run on the same service provider).

- **Flexibility**: Reflects the functionalities and types of data that can be stored, with high-quality data essential to avoid bottlenecks in critical processes.

- **Availability**: Indicates how easily users can access blockspace. It should be easily accessible, allowing diverse business models to thrive, ideally regulated by a marketplace based on demand and supplemented by options for "second-hand" blockspace.

Polkadot is built on core blockspace principles, but there's room for improvement. Tasks like balance transfers, staking, and governance are managed on the relay chain.

Delegating these responsibilities to [system chains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/){target=\_blank} could enhance flexibility and allow the relay chain to concentrate on providing shared security and interoperability.

For more information about blockspace, watch [Robert Habermeier’s interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1vISppPwe4){target=\_blank} or read his [technical blog post](https://www.rob.tech/blog/polkadot-blockspace-over-blockchains/){target=\_blank}.

## DOT Token

DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network, much like BTC for Bitcoin and Ether for the Ethereum blockchain. DOT has 10 decimals, uses the Planck base unit, and has a balance type of `u128`. The same is true for Kusama's KSM token with the exception of having 12 decimals.

### Redenomination of DOT
    
Polkadot conducted a community poll, which ended on 27 July 2020 at block 888,888, to decide whether to redenominate the DOT token. The stakeholders chose to redenominate the token, changing the value of 1 DOT from 1e12 plancks to 1e10 plancks.

Importantly, this did not affect the network's total number of base units (plancks); it only affects how a single DOT is represented. The redenomination became effective 72 hours after transfers were enabled, occurring at block 1,248,328 on 21 August 2020 around 16:50 UTC.

### The Planck Unit

The smallest unit of account balance on Polkadot SDK-based blockchains (such as Polkadot and Kusama) is called _Planck_, named after the Planck length, the smallest measurable distance in the physical universe.

Similar to how BTC's smallest unit is the Satoshi and ETH's is the Wei, Polkadot's native token DOT equals 1e10 Planck, while Kusama's native token KSM equals 1e12 Planck.

### Uses for DOT

DOT serves three primary functions within the Polkadot network:

- **Governance**: It is used to participate in the governance of the network.
- **Staking**: DOT is staked to support the network's operation and security.
- **Buying coretime**: Used to purchase coretime in-bulk or on-demand and access the  chain to benefit from Polkadot's security and interoperability.

Additionally, DOT can serve as a transferable token. For example, DOT, held in the treasury, can be allocated to teams developing projects that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem.

## JAM and the Road Ahead

The Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) represents a transformative redesign of Polkadot's core architecture, envisioned as the successor to the current relay chain. Unlike traditional blockchain architectures, JAM introduces a unique computational model that processes work through two primary functions:

- **Join**: Handles data integration.
- **Accumulate**: Folds computations into the chain's state.

JAM removes many of the opinions and constraints of the current relay chain while maintaining its core security properties. Expected improvements include:

- **Permissionless code execution**: JAM is designed to be more generic and flexible, allowing for permissionless code execution through services that can be deployed without governance approval.
- **More effective block time utilization**: JAM's efficient pipeline processing model places the prior state root in block headers instead of the posterior state root, enabling more effective utilization of block time for computations.

This architectural evolution promises to enhance Polkadot's scalability and flexibility while maintaining robust security guarantees. JAM is planned to be rolled out to Polkadot as a single, complete upgrade rather than a stream of smaller updates. This approach seeks to minimize the developer overhead required to address any breaking changes.

# Parachains Overview

## Introduction

A parachain is a specialized blockchain that connects to the Polkadot relay chain, benefiting from shared security, interoperability, and scalability. Parachains are built using the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank}, a powerful toolkit written in Rust that provides everything needed to create custom blockchain logic while integrating seamlessly with the Polkadot network.

Unlike standalone blockchains that must bootstrap their own validator sets and security, parachains leverage Polkadot's pooled security model. This allows parachain developers to focus on their application-specific functionality rather than consensus and security infrastructure. Parachains can communicate with each other through Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM), enabling seamless interoperability across the Polkadot ecosystem.

Key capabilities that parachains provide include:

- **Shared security**: Inherit security from Polkadot's validator set without maintaining your own.
- **Interoperability**: Communicate trustlessly with other parachains via XCM.
- **Scalability**: Process transactions in parallel with other parachains.
- **Customization**: Build application-specific logic tailored to your use case.
- **Upgradeability**: Upgrade runtime logic without hard forks.

## Polkadot SDK: Parachain Architecture

Building a parachain involves understanding and utilizing several key components of the Polkadot SDK:

![](/images/reference/parachains/index/overview-01.webp)

- **[Substrate](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/substrate/index.html){target=\_blank}**: The foundation providing core blockchain primitives and libraries.
- **[FRAME](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html){target=\_blank}**: A modular framework for building your parachain's runtime logic.
- **[Cumulus](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/cumulus/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Essential libraries and pallets that enable parachain functionality.
- **[XCM (Cross Consensus Messaging)](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/xcm/index.html){target=\_blank}**: The messaging format for communicating with other parachains and the relay chain.
- **[Polkadot](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/polkadot/index.html){target=\_blank}**: The relay chain that provides security and coordination.

### Substrate: The Foundation

Substrate provides the core infrastructure that every parachain is built upon. It handles the low-level blockchain functionality, allowing you to focus on your application's unique features. Substrate includes implementations for networking, database management, consensus participation, and the execution environment for your runtime.

Every Polkadot SDK node consists of two main components:

- **Client (Host)**: Handles infrastructure services.

    - Native binary that runs on validator and collator nodes.
    - Executes the Wasm-compiled runtime.
    - Manages networking, database, mempool, and block production.
    - Interfaces with the relay chain for validation.

- **Runtime (State Transition Function)**: Contains your business logic.

    - Defines how your Polkadot SDK node processes transactions.
    - Compiled to [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/){target=\_blank} for deterministic execution.
    - Stored on-chain and upgradeable via governance.

### FRAME: Building Blocks for Your Runtime

FRAME provides modular components called [pallets](/reference/glossary#pallet){target=\_blank} that you can compose to build your parachain's runtime. Each pallet provides specific functionality that you can customize and configure for your needs. This modular approach allows you to quickly assemble complex functionality without writing everything from scratch.

### Cumulus: Parachain-Specific Functionality

Cumulus is what transforms a Polkadot SDK-based runtime into a parachain-capable runtime. It provides the essential components for communicating with the relay chain, participating in Polkadot's consensus, and handling parachain-specific operations like block validation and collation.

Key Cumulus components include:

- **Parachain system pallet**: Core parachain functionality and relay chain communication.
- **Collator consensus**: Block production logic for parachain collators.
- **Relay chain interface**: APIs for interacting with the Polkadot relay chain.
- **Validation data**: Handling proof-of-validity data required by relay chain validators.

## Where to Go Next

Building a parachain requires understanding the relationship between your chain and the Polkadot relay chain. The Polkadot SDK provides all the tools needed to design custom runtime logic, enable cross-chain communication, and deploy your parachain to production.

The following sections provide detailed guidance on each aspect of parachain development, from initial design through deployment and ongoing maintenance.

Page Title: Polkadart

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/reference-tools-polkadart.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/tools/polkadart/
- Summary: Polkadart is a type-safe, native Dart, SDK for Polkadot and any compatible Polkadot-SDK blockchain network.

# Polkadart

Polkadart is the most comprehensive Dart/Flutter SDK for interacting with Polkadot, Substrate, and other compatible blockchain networks. Designed with a Dart-first approach and type-safe APIs, it provides everything developers need to build powerful decentralized applications.

This page will outline some of the core components of Polkadart. For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://polkadart.dev){target=\_blank}.

## Installation

Add Polkadart to your `pubspec.yaml`:

=== "All packages"

    ```bash
    dart pub add polkadart polkadart_cli polkadart_keyring polkadart_scale_codec secp256k1_ecdsa sr25519 ss58 substrate_bip39 substrate_metadata
    ```

=== "Core only"

    ```bash
    dart pub add polkadart polkadart_cli polkadart_keyring
    ```

For type-safe API generation, add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
polkadart:
  output_dir: lib/generated
  chains:
    polkadot: wss://rpc.polkadot.io
    kusama: wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io
    custom: wss://your-node.example.com
```
{% endraw %}

## Get Started

### Type Generation

Polkadart provides a CLI tool to generate type definitions from any Polkadot-SDK compatible blockchain network. This allows you to build type-safe Dart applications without dealing with the low-level details of the blockchain.

### Run Generator

```bash
dart run polkadart_cli:generate -v
```

### Use Generated Types

```dart
import 'package:your_app/generated/polkadot/polkadot.dart';
import 'package:polkadart/polkadart.dart';
import 'package:ss58/ss58.dart';

final provider = Provider.fromUri(Uri.parse('wss://rpc.polkadot.io'));
final polkadot = Polkadot(provider);
  
// Account from SS58 address
final account = Address.decode('19t9Q2ay58hMDaeg6eeBhqmHsRnc2jDMV3cYYw9zbc59HLj');

// Retrieve Account Balance
final accountInfo = await polkadot.query.system.account(account.pubkey);
print('Balance: ${accountInfo.data.free}')
```

### Creating an API Instance

An API instance is required to interact with the blockchain. Polkadart provides a `Provider` class that allows you to connect to any network.

```dart
import 'package:demo/generated/polkadot/polkadot.dart';
import 'package:polkadart/provider.dart';

Future<void> main(List<String> arguments) async {
  final provider = Provider.fromUri(Uri.parse('wss://rpc.polkadot.io'));
  final polkadot = Polkadot(provider);
}
```

### Reading Chain Data

Besides querying the data using the `query` from the generated API, you can also use the State API for querying storage data, metadata, runtime information, and other chain information.

```dart
final stateApi = StateApi(provider);

// Get current runtime version
final runtimeVersion = await stateApi.getRuntimeVersion();
print(runtimeVersion.toJson());

// Get metadata
final metadata = await stateApi.getMetadata();
print('Metadata version: ${metadata.version}');
```

### Subscribe to New Blocks

You can subscribe to new blocks on the blockchain using the `subscribe` method.

```dart
final subscription = await provider.subscribe('chain_subscribeNewHeads', []);

subscription.stream.forEach((response) {
  print('New head: ${response.result}');
});
```

### Send a Transaction

Perhaps the most common operation done in any blockchain is transferring funds. Here you can see how that can be done using Polkadart:

```dart
final wallet = await KeyPair.sr25519.fromUri("//Alice");
print('Alice\' wallet: ${wallet.address}');

// Get information necessary to build a proper extrinsic
final runtimeVersion = await polkadot.rpc.state.getRuntimeVersion();
final currentBlockNumber = (await polkadot.query.system.number()) - 1;
final currentBlockHash = await polkadot.query.system.blockHash(currentBlockNumber);
final genesisHash = await polkadot.query.system.blockHash(0);
final nonce = await polkadot.rpc.system.accountNextIndex(wallet.address);

// Make the encoded call
final multiAddress = $MultiAddress().id(wallet.publicKey.bytes);
final transferCall = polkadot.tx.balances.transferKeepAlive(dest: multiAddress, value: BigInt.one).encode();

// Make the payload
final payload = SigningPayload(
    method: transferCall,
    specVersion: runtimeVersion.specVersion,
    transactionVersion: runtimeVersion.transactionVersion,
    genesisHash: encodeHex(genesisHash),
    blockHash: encodeHex(currentBlockHash),
    blockNumber: currentBlockNumber,
    eraPeriod: 64,
    nonce: nonce,
    tip: 0,
).encode(polkadot.registry);

// Sign the payload and build the final extrinsic
final signature = wallet.sign(payload);
final extrinsic = ExtrinsicPayload(
  signer: wallet.bytes(),
  method: transferCall,
  signature: signature,
  eraPeriod: 64,
  blockNumber: currentBlockNumber,
  nonce: nonce,
  tip: 0,
).encode(polkadot.registry, SignatureType.sr25519);

// Send the extrinsic to the blockchain
final author = AuthorApi(provider);
await author.submitAndWatchExtrinsic(extrinsic, (data) {
  print(data);
});
```

Page Title: Polkadot Hub Overview

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/reference-polkadot-hub.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/polkadot-hub/
- Summary: Learn how Polkadot Hub serves as the entry point to Polkadot, providing access to smart contracts, staking, governance, identity management, and cross-ecosystem interoperability.

## Introduction

Polkadot Hub is the entry point for all users and application developers to Polkadot. It provides access to essential Web3 services, including smart contracts, staking, governance, identity management, and cross-ecosystem interoperability—without requiring you to deploy or manage a parachain.

The Hub encompasses a set of core functionality that enables developers and users to build and interact with applications on Polkadot. This specialized system of parachains and services works together seamlessly to deliver a unified platform experience. The modular approach lets you interact with services optimized for specific use cases, while still benefiting from Polkadot's shared security.

## Polkadot Hub Capabilities

Whether you're just getting started or building complex applications, the Hub supports the ability to:
 
- Hold, send, and receive DOT and other assets across the network.
- Stake DOT to participate in network security and earn rewards.
- Vote in governance referendums and shape Polkadot's future.
- Create both fungible and non-fungible tokens and assets for your projects.
- Pay transaction fees in any asset, not just DOT.
- Register as an individual and establish your on-chain identity.

For more sophisticated development use cases, the Hub enables you to:

- Deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts using Solidity or other EVM languages.
- Build decentralized applications that leverage Polkadot's security and interoperability.
- Create and manage fungible tokens and NFTs with low fees and flexible operations.
- Manage cross-chain interactions through XCM messaging with other parachains.

Establish verifiable on-chain identities, control disclosure of personal information, and receive verification from trusted registrars. People Chain enables secure identity management with hierarchical sub-account support, forming the foundation for trusted interactions throughout the ecosystem.

### Bridge Hub

[Bridge Hub](/reference/polkadot-hub/bridging/){target=\_blank} facilitates trustless interactions between Polkadot and external blockchains like Ethereum and Kusama. Through implementations such as Snowbridge, Bridge Hub enables secure cross-chain communication via on-chain light clients and trustless relayers. This component ensures seamless interoperability beyond the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Consensus & Security

[Consensus and Security](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/){target=\_blank} covers the fundamental mechanisms that protect the network. Learn about validator participation, how the relay chain validates all transactions, and the cryptoeconomic incentives that secure Polkadot. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for validators and anyone building critical infrastructure on the network.

### Collectives & DAOs

[Collectives and DAOs](/reference/polkadot-hub/collectives-and-daos/){target=\_blank} enable specialized governance organizations within Polkadot. Participate in collective membership, manage treasury operations, and engage in coordinated decision-making with groups aligned around specific purposes. This functionality supports the creation of autonomous organizations on Polkadot.

# Polkadot Omni Node

## Introduction

The [`polkadot-omni-node`](https://crates.io/crates/polkadot-omni-node/0.7.0){target=\_blank} crate is a versatile, pre-built binary designed to simplify running parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem. Unlike traditional node binaries that are tightly coupled to specific runtime code, the `polkadot-omni-node` operates using an external [chain specification](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#chain-specification){target=\_blank} file, allowing it to adapt dynamically to different parachains.

This approach enables it to act as a white-labeled node binary, capable of running most parachains that do not require custom node-level logic or extensions. Developers can leverage this flexibility to test, deploy, or operate parachain nodes without maintaining a dedicated codebase for each network.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the `polkadot-omni-node`, obtaining a chain specification, and spinning up a parachain node.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/){target=\_blank}**: Required to build and install the `polkadot-omni-node` binary.

Ensure Rust's `cargo` command is available in your terminal by running:

```bash
cargo --version
```

## Install Polkadot Omni Node

To install `polkadot-omni-node` globally using `cargo`, run:

```bash
cargo install --locked polkadot-omni-node@0.7.0
```

This command downloads and installs version 0.7.0 of the binary, making it available system-wide.

To confirm the installation, run:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --version
```

You should see the installed version number printed to the terminal, confirming a successful installation.

## Obtain Chain Specifications

The `polkadot-omni-node` binary uses a chain specification file to configure and launch a parachain node. This file defines the parachain's genesis state and network settings.

The most common source for official chain specifications is the [`paritytech/chainspecs`](https://github.com/paritytech/chainspecs){target=\_blank} repository. These specifications are also browsable in a user-friendly format via the [Chainspec Collection](https://paritytech.github.io/chainspecs/){target=\_blank} website.

To obtain a chain specification:

1. Visit the [Chainspec Collection](https://paritytech.github.io/chainspecs/){target=\_blank} website.
2. Find the parachain you want to run.
3. Click the chain spec to open it.
4. Copy the JSON content and save it locally as a `.json` file, e.g., `chain_spec.json`.

## Run a Parachain Full Node

Once you've installed `polkadot-omni-node` and saved the appropriate chain specification file, you can start a full node for your chosen parachain.

To see all available flags and configuration options, run:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --help
```

To launch the node, run the following command, replacing `./INSERT_PARACHAIN_CHAIN_SPEC.json` with the actual path to your saved chain spec file.

This command will:

- Load the chain specification.
- Initialize the node using the provided network configuration.
- Begin syncing with the parachain network.

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --chain ./INSERT_PARACHAIN_CHAIN_SPEC.json --sync warp
```

- The `--chain` flag tells the `polkadot-omni-node` which parachain to run by pointing to its chain specification file.
- The `--sync warp` flag enables warp sync, allowing the node to quickly catch up to the latest finalized state. Historical blocks are fetched in the background as the node continues operating.

Once started, the node will begin connecting to peers and syncing with the network. You’ll see logs in your terminal reflecting its progress.

## Interact with the Node

By default, `polkadot-omni-node` exposes a WebSocket endpoint at `ws://localhost:9944`,  which you can use to interact with the running node. You can connect using:

- **[Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank}**: A web-based interface for exploring and interacting with Polkadot SDK-based chains.
- Custom scripts using compatible [libraries](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/){target=\_blank}.

Once connected, you can review blocks, call extrinsics, inspect storage, and interact with the runtime.

## Parachain Compatibility

The `polkadot-omni-node` is designed to work with most parachains out of the box; however, your parachain's runtime must meet specific requirements and follow certain conventions to be compatible. This section outlines what your runtime needs to implement and configure to work seamlessly with the `polkadot-omni-node`:

- Your runtime must implement the required runtime APIs (see below).
- Your runtime must include and configure the required pallets.

The [`parachain-template`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template/tree/v0.0.4){target=_blank} provides a complete reference implementation that is fully compatible with the `polkadot-omni-node`. You can use it as a starting point or reference for ensuring your runtime meets all compatibility requirements.

### Required Runtime APIs

Your parachain runtime must implement the following runtime APIs for the `polkadot-omni-node` to function properly:

- **GetParachainInfo Runtime API**: The omni-node requires the [`GetParachainInfo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/cumulus_primitives_core/trait.GetParachainInfo.html){target=\_blank} runtime API to identify and configure the parachain correctly. This API provides the parachain ID to the node.

    ```rust title="runtime/src/apis.rs"
    impl cumulus_primitives_core::GetParachainInfo<Block> for Runtime {
        fn parachain_id() -> cumulus_primitives_core::ParaId {
            // Return your parachain ID
            ParachainInfo::parachain_id()
        }
    }
    ```

- **Aura Runtime API**: For consensus, the `polkadot-omni-node` expects the [Aura runtime API](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/runtime/apis/trait.AuraApi.html){target=\_blank} to be implemented.

    ```rust title="runtime/src/apis.rs"
    impl sp_consensus_aura::AuraApi<Block, AuraId> for Runtime {
        fn slot_duration() -> sp_consensus_aura::SlotDuration {
            sp_consensus_aura::SlotDuration::from_millis(SLOT_DURATION)
        }

        fn authorities() -> Vec<AuraId> {
            Aura::authorities().into_inner()
        }
    }
    ```

### Required Pallets

Your runtime must include and properly configure the following pallets:

- **System Pallet**: The System pallet ([`frame-system`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/prelude/frame_system/index.html){target=\_blank}) is fundamental and must be configured with appropriate types.

    ```rust title="runtime/src/lib.rs"
    #[frame_support::runtime]
    impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {
        type Block = Block;
        type BlockNumber = BlockNumber;
        // ... other configurations
    }

    // Must be named "System" for omni-node compatibility
    pub type System = frame_system::Pallet<Runtime>;
    ```

- **ParachainSystem Pallet**: This pallet ([`cumulus-pallet-parachain-system`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/cumulus_pallet_parachain_system/index.html){target=\_blank}) enables parachain functionality and handles low-level details of being a parachain.

    ```rust title="runtime/src/lib.rs"
    impl cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::Config for Runtime {
        type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
        type OnSystemEvent = ();
        // ... other configurations
    }

    // Must be named "ParachainSystem" for omni-node compatibility  
    pub type ParachainSystem = cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::Pallet<Runtime>;
    ```

- **Aura Pallet**: For block authoring consensus ([`pallet-aura`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_aura/index.html){target=\_blank}).

    ```rust title="runtime/src/lib.rs"
    impl pallet_aura::Config for Runtime {
        type AuthorityId = AuraId;
        type DisabledValidators = ();
        type MaxAuthorities = MaxAuthorities;
        type AllowMultipleBlocksPerSlot = ConstBool<false>;
    }

    pub type Aura = pallet_aura::Pallet<Runtime>;
    ```

- **ParachainInfo Pallet**: Provides parachain metadata ([`parachain-info`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_parachain_info/index.html){target=\_blank}).

    ```rust title="runtime/src/lib.rs"
    impl parachain_info::Config for Runtime {}

    pub type ParachainInfo = parachain_info::Pallet<Runtime>;
    ```

If you're migrating an existing parachain to use the `polkadot-omni-node`, you may need to perform runtime upgrades to add the required runtime APIs and pallets. Follow the standard parachain [runtime upgrade](/parachains/runtime-maintenance/runtime-upgrades/){target=\_blank} procedures to implement these changes on your live network.

# Accounts

## Introduction

Accounts are essential for managing identity, transactions, and governance on the network in the Polkadot SDK. Understanding these components is critical for seamless development and operation on the network, whether you're building or interacting with Polkadot-based chains.

This page will guide you through the essential aspects of accounts, including their data structure, balance types, reference counters, and address formats. You’ll learn how accounts are managed within the runtime, how balances are categorized, and how addresses are encoded and validated. 

## Account Data Structure

Accounts are foundational to any blockchain, and the Polkadot SDK provides a flexible management system. This section explains how the Polkadot SDK defines accounts and manages their lifecycle through data structures within the runtime.

### Account

The [`Account` data type](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/type.Account.html){target=\_blank} is a storage map within the [System pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/src/frame_system/lib.rs.html){target=\_blank} that links an account ID to its corresponding data. This structure is fundamental for mapping account-related information within the chain.

The code snippet below shows how accounts are defined:

```rs
 /// The full account information for a particular account ID.
 	#[pallet::storage]
 	#[pallet::getter(fn account)]
 	pub type Account<T: Config> = StorageMap<
 		_,
 		Blake2_128Concat,
 		T::AccountId,
 		AccountInfo<T::Nonce, T::AccountData>,
 		ValueQuery,
 	>;
```

The preceding code block defines a storage map named `Account`. The `StorageMap` is a type of on-chain storage that maps keys to values. In the `Account` map, the key is an account ID, and the value is the account's information. Here, `T` represents the generic parameter for the runtime configuration, which is defined by the pallet's configuration trait (`Config`).

The `StorageMap` consists of the following parameters:

- **`_`**: Used in macro expansion and acts as a placeholder for the storage prefix type. Tells the macro to insert the default prefix during expansion.
- **`Blake2_128Concat`**: The hashing function applied to keys in the storage map.
- **`T: :AccountId`**: Represents the key type, which corresponds to the account’s unique ID.
- **`AccountInfo<T: :Nonce, T::AccountData>`**: The value type stored in the map. For each account ID, the map stores an `AccountInfo` struct containing:

    - **`T::Nonce`**: A nonce for the account, which is incremented with each transaction to ensure transaction uniqueness.
    - **`T: :AccountData`**: Custom account data defined by the runtime configuration, which could include balances, locked funds, or other relevant information.
    
- **`ValueQuery`**: Defines how queries to the storage map behave when no value is found; returns a default value instead of `None`.

For a detailed explanation of storage maps, see the [`StorageMap`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageMap.html){target=\_blank} entry in the Rust docs.

### Account Info

The `AccountInfo` structure is another key element within the [System pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/src/frame_system/lib.rs.html){target=\_blank}, providing more granular details about each account's state. This structure tracks vital data, such as the number of transactions and the account’s relationships with other modules.

```rs
/// Information of an account.
#[derive(Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Default, RuntimeDebug, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, MaxEncodedLen)]
pub struct AccountInfo<Nonce, AccountData> {
	/// The number of transactions this account has sent.
	pub nonce: Nonce,
	/// The number of other modules that currently depend on this account's existence. The account
	/// cannot be reaped until this is zero.
	pub consumers: RefCount,
	/// The number of other modules that allow this account to exist. The account may not be reaped
	/// until this and `sufficients` are both zero.
	pub providers: RefCount,
	/// The number of modules that allow this account to exist for their own purposes only. The
	/// account may not be reaped until this and `providers` are both zero.
	pub sufficients: RefCount,
	/// The additional data that belongs to this account. Used to store the balance(s) in a lot of
	/// chains.
	pub data: AccountData,
}
```

The `AccountInfo` structure includes the following components:

- **`nonce`**: Tracks the number of transactions initiated by the account, which ensures transaction uniqueness and prevents replay attacks.
- **`consumers`**: Counts how many other modules or pallets rely on this account’s existence. The account cannot be removed from the chain (reaped) until this count reaches zero.
- **`providers`**: Tracks how many modules permit this account’s existence. An account can only be reaped once both `providers` and `sufficients` are zero.
- **`sufficients`**: Represents the number of modules that allow the account to exist for internal purposes, independent of any other modules.
- **`AccountData`**: A flexible data structure that can be customized in the runtime configuration, usually containing balances or other user-specific data.

This structure helps manage an account's state and prevents its premature removal while it is still referenced by other on-chain data or modules. The [`AccountInfo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/struct.AccountInfo.html){target=\_blank} structure can vary as long as it satisfies the trait bounds defined by the `AccountData` associated type in the [`frame-system::pallet::Config`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/trait.Config.html){target=\_blank} trait.

### Account Reference Counters

Polkadot SDK uses reference counters to track an account’s dependencies across different runtime modules. These counters ensure that accounts remain active while data is associated with them.

The reference counters include:

- **`consumers`**: Prevents account removal while other pallets still rely on the account.
- **`providers`**: Ensures an account is active before other pallets store data related to it.
- **`sufficients`**: Indicates the account’s independence, ensuring it can exist even without a native token balance, such as when holding sufficient alternative assets.

#### Providers Reference Counters

The `providers` counter ensures that an account is ready to be depended upon by other runtime modules. For example, it is incremented when an account has a balance above the existential deposit, which marks the account as active.

The system requires this reference counter to be greater than zero for the `consumers` counter to be incremented, ensuring the account is stable before any dependencies are added.

#### Consumers Reference Counters

The `consumers` counter ensures that the account cannot be reaped until all references to it across the runtime have been removed. This check prevents the accidental deletion of accounts that still have active on-chain data.

It is the user’s responsibility to clear out any data from other runtime modules if they wish to remove their account and reclaim their existential deposit.

#### Sufficients Reference Counter

The `sufficients` counter tracks accounts that can exist independently without relying on a native account balance. This is useful for accounts holding other types of assets, like tokens, without needing a minimum balance in the native token.

For instance, the [Assets pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_assets/index.html){target=\_blank}, may increment this counter for an account holding sufficient tokens.

#### Account Deactivation

In Polkadot SDK-based chains, an account is deactivated when its reference counters (such as `providers`, `consumers`, and `sufficient`) reach zero. These counters ensure the account remains active as long as other runtime modules or pallets reference it.

When all dependencies are cleared and the counters drop to zero, the account becomes deactivated and may be removed from the chain (reaped). This is particularly important in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, where accounts with balances below the existential deposit threshold are pruned from storage to conserve state resources.

Each pallet that references an account has cleanup functions that decrement these counters when the pallet no longer depends on the account. Once these counters reach zero, the account is marked for deactivation.

#### Updating Counters

The Polkadot SDK provides runtime developers with various methods to manage account lifecycle events, such as deactivation or incrementing reference counters. These methods ensure that accounts cannot be reaped while still in use.

The following helper functions manage these counters:

- **`inc_consumers()`**: Increments the `consumer` reference counter for an account, signaling that another pallet depends on it.
- **`dec_consumers()`**: Decrements the `consumer` reference counter, signaling that a pallet no longer relies on the account.
- **`inc_providers()`**: Increments the `provider` reference counter, ensuring the account remains active.
- **`dec_providers()`**: Decrements the `provider` reference counter, allowing for account deactivation when no longer in use.
- **`inc_sufficients()`**: Increments the `sufficient` reference counter for accounts that hold sufficient assets.
- **`dec_sufficients()`**: Decrements the `sufficient` reference counter.

To ensure proper account cleanup and lifecycle management, a corresponding decrement should be made for each increment action.

The `System` pallet offers three query functions to assist developers in tracking account states:

- **[`can_inc_consumer()`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.can_inc_consumer){target=\_blank}**: Checks if the account can safely increment the consumer reference.
- **[`can_dec_provider()`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.can_dec_provider){target=\_blank}**: Ensures that no consumers exist before allowing the decrement of the provider counter.
- **[`is_provider_required()`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.is_provider_required){target=\_blank}**: Verifies whether the account still has any active consumer references.

This modular and flexible system of reference counters tightly controls the lifecycle of accounts in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, preventing the accidental removal or retention of unneeded accounts. You can refer to the [System pallet Rust docs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank} for more details.
    

## Account Balance Types

In the Polkadot ecosystem, account balances are categorized into different types based on how the funds are utilized and their availability. These balance types determine the actions that can be performed, such as transferring tokens, paying transaction fees, or participating in governance activities. Understanding these balance types helps developers manage user accounts and implement balance-dependent logic.

!!! note "A more efficient distribution of account balance types is in development"
    Soon, pallets in the Polkadot SDK will implement the [`Fungible` trait](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/index.html){target=\_blank} (see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/226){target=\_blank} for more details). For example, the [`transaction-storage`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_transaction_storage/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet changed the implementation of the [`Currency`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/currency/index.html){target=\_blank} trait (see the [Refactor transaction storage pallet to use fungible traits](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1800){target=\_blank} PR for further details):

    ```rust
    type BalanceOf<T> = <<T as Config>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance;
    ```
    
    To the [`Fungible`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/index.html){target=\_blank} trait:

    ```rust
    type BalanceOf<T> = <<T as Config>::Currency as FnInspect<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance;
    ```
    
    This update will enable more efficient use of account balances, allowing the free balance to be utilized for on-chain activities such as setting proxies and managing identities.

### Balance Types

The five main balance types are:

- **Free balance**: Represents the total tokens available to the account for any on-chain activity, including staking, governance, and voting. However, it may not be fully spendable or transferrable if portions of it are locked or reserved.
- **Locked balance**: Portions of the free balance that cannot be spent or transferred because they are tied up in specific activities like [staking](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-staking/#nominating-validators){target=\_blank}, [vesting](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-guides-transfers/#vested-transfers-with-the-polkadot-js-ui){target=\_blank}, or participating in [governance](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/#voting-on-a-referendum){target=\_blank}. While the tokens remain part of the free balance, they are non-transferable for the duration of the lock.
- **Reserved balance**: Funds locked by specific system actions, such as setting up an [identity](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-identity/){target=\_blank}, creating [proxies](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-proxies/){target=\_blank}, or submitting [deposits for governance proposals](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-guides-polkadot-opengov/#claiming-opengov-deposits){target=\_blank}. These tokens are not part of the free balance and cannot be spent unless they are unreserved.
- **Spendable balance**: The portion of the free balance that is available for immediate spending or transfers. It is calculated by subtracting the maximum of locked or reserved amounts from the free balance, ensuring that existential deposit limits are met.
- **Untouchable balance**: Funds that cannot be directly spent or transferred but may still be utilized for on-chain activities, such as governance participation or staking. These tokens are typically tied to certain actions or locked for a specific period.

The spendable balance is calculated as follows:

```text
spendable = free - max(locked - reserved, ED)
```

Here, `free`, `locked`, and `reserved` are defined above. The `ED` represents the [existential deposit](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#existential-deposit-and-reaping){target=\_blank}, the minimum balance required to keep an account active and prevent it from being reaped. You may find you can't see all balance types when looking at your account via a wallet. Wallet providers often display only spendable, locked, and reserved balances.

### Locks

Locks are applied to an account's free balance, preventing that portion from being spent or transferred. Locks are automatically placed when an account participates in specific on-chain activities, such as staking or governance. Although multiple locks may be applied simultaneously, they do not stack. Instead, the largest lock determines the total amount of locked tokens.

Locks follow these basic rules:

- If different locks apply to varying amounts, the largest lock amount takes precedence.
- If multiple locks apply to the same amount, the lock with the longest duration governs when the balance can be unlocked.

#### Locks Example

Consider an example where an account has 80 DOT locked for both staking and governance purposes like so:

- 80 DOT is staked with a 28-day lock period.
- 24 DOT is locked for governance with a 1x conviction and a 7-day lock period.
- 4 DOT is locked for governance with a 6x conviction and a 224-day lock period.

In this case, the total locked amount is 80 DOT because only the largest lock (80 DOT from staking) governs the locked balance. These 80 DOT will be released at different times based on the lock durations. In this example, the 24 DOT locked for governance will be released first since the shortest lock period is seven days. The 80 DOT stake with a 28-day lock period is released next. Now, all that remains locked is the 4 DOT for governance. After 224 days, all 80 DOT (minus the existential deposit) will be free and transferable.

![Illustration of Lock Example](/images/reference/parachains/accounts/accounts-01.webp)

#### Edge Cases for Locks

In scenarios where multiple convictions and lock periods are active, the lock duration and amount are determined by the longest period and largest amount. For example, if you delegate with different convictions and attempt to undelegate during an active lock period, the lock may be extended for the full amount of tokens. For a detailed discussion on edge case lock behavior, see this [Stack Exchange post](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/5067/delegating-and-undelegating-during-the-lock-period-extends-it-for-the-initial-am){target=\_blank}.

### Balance Types on Polkadot.js

Polkadot.js provides a user-friendly interface for managing and visualizing various account balances on Polkadot and Kusama networks. When interacting with Polkadot.js, you will encounter multiple balance types that are critical for understanding how your funds are distributed and restricted. This section explains how different balances are displayed in the Polkadot.js UI and what each type represents.

![](/images/reference/parachains/accounts/accounts-02.webp)

The most common balance types displayed on Polkadot.js are:

- **Total balance**: The total number of tokens available in the account. This includes all tokens, whether they are transferable, locked, reserved, or vested. However, the total balance does not always reflect what can be spent immediately. In this example, the total balance is 0.6274 KSM.

- **Transferable balance**: Shows how many tokens are immediately available for transfer. It is calculated by subtracting the locked and reserved balances from the total balance. For example, if an account has a total balance of 0.6274 KSM and a transferable balance of 0.0106 KSM, only the latter amount can be sent or spent freely.

- **Vested balance**: Tokens that allocated to the account but released according to a specific schedule. Vested tokens remain locked and cannot be transferred until fully vested. For example, an account with a vested balance of 0.2500 KSM means that this amount is owned but not yet transferable.

- **Locked balance**: Tokens that are temporarily restricted from being transferred or spent. These locks typically result from participating in staking, governance, or vested transfers. In Polkadot.js, locked balances do not stack—only the largest lock is applied. For instance, if an account has 0.5500 KSM locked for governance and staking, the locked balance would display 0.5500 KSM, not the sum of all locked amounts.

- **Reserved balance**: Refers to tokens locked for specific on-chain actions, such as setting an identity, creating a proxy, or making governance deposits. Reserved tokens are not part of the free balance, but can be freed by performing certain actions. For example, removing an identity would unreserve those funds.

- **Bonded balance**: The tokens locked for staking purposes. Bonded tokens are not transferable until they are unbonded after the unbonding period.

- **Redeemable balance**: The number of tokens that have completed the unbonding period and are ready to be unlocked and transferred again. For example, if an account has a redeemable balance of 0.1000 KSM, those tokens are now available for spending.

- **Democracy balance**: Reflects the number of tokens locked for governance activities, such as voting on referenda. These tokens are locked for the duration of the governance action and are only released after the lock period ends.

By understanding these balance types and their implications, developers and users can better manage their funds and engage with on-chain activities more effectively.

## Address Formats

The SS58 address format is a core component of the Polkadot SDK that enables accounts to be uniquely identified across Polkadot-based networks. This format is a modified version of Bitcoin's Base58Check encoding, specifically designed to accommodate the multi-chain nature of the Polkadot ecosystem. SS58 encoding allows each chain to define its own set of addresses while maintaining compatibility and checksum validation for security. 

### Basic Format

SS58 addresses consist of three main components:

```text
base58encode(concat(<address-type>, <address>, <checksum>))
```

- **Address type**: A byte or set of bytes that define the network (or chain) for which the address is intended. This ensures that addresses are unique across different Polkadot SDK-based chains.
- **Address**: The public key of the account encoded as bytes.
- **Checksum**: A hash-based checksum which ensures that addresses are valid and unaltered. The checksum is derived from the concatenated address type and address components, ensuring integrity.

The encoding process transforms the concatenated components into a Base58 string, providing a compact and human-readable format that avoids easily confused characters (e.g., zero '0', capital 'O', lowercase 'l'). This encoding function ([`encode`](https://docs.rs/bs58/latest/bs58/fn.encode.html){target=\_blank}) is implemented exactly as defined in Bitcoin and IPFS specifications, using the same alphabet as both implementations.

For more details about the SS58 address format implementation, see the [`Ss58Codec`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_core/crypto/trait.Ss58Codec.html){target=\_blank} trait in the Rust Docs.

### Address Type

The address type defines how an address is interpreted and to which network it belongs. Polkadot SDK uses different prefixes to distinguish between various chains and address formats:

- **Address types `0-63`**: Simple addresses, commonly used for network identifiers.
- **Address types `64-127`**: Full addresses that support a wider range of network identifiers.
- **Address types `128-255`**: Reserved for future address format extensions.

For example, Polkadot’s main network uses an address type of 0, while Kusama uses 2. This ensures that addresses can be used without confusion between networks.

The address type is always encoded as part of the SS58 address, making it easy to quickly identify the network. Refer to the [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry){target=\_blank} for the canonical listing of all address type identifiers and how they map to Polkadot SDK-based networks.

### Address Length

SS58 addresses can have different lengths depending on the specific format. Address lengths range from as short as 3 to 35 bytes, depending on the complexity of the address and network requirements. This flexibility allows SS58 addresses to adapt to different chains while providing a secure encoding mechanism.

| Total | Type | Raw account | Checksum |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| 3     | 1    | 1           | 1        |
| 4     | 1    | 2           | 1        |
| 5     | 1    | 2           | 2        |
| 6     | 1    | 4           | 1        |
| 7     | 1    | 4           | 2        |
| 8     | 1    | 4           | 3        |
| 9     | 1    | 4           | 4        |
| 10    | 1    | 8           | 1        |
| 11    | 1    | 8           | 2        |
| 12    | 1    | 8           | 3        |
| 13    | 1    | 8           | 4        |
| 14    | 1    | 8           | 5        |
| 15    | 1    | 8           | 6        |
| 16    | 1    | 8           | 7        |
| 17    | 1    | 8           | 8        |
| 35    | 1    | 32          | 2        |

SS58 addresses also support different payload sizes, allowing a flexible range of account identifiers.

### Checksum Types

A checksum is applied to validate SS58 addresses. Polkadot SDK uses a Blake2b-512 hash function to calculate the checksum, which is appended to the address before encoding. The checksum length can vary depending on the address format (e.g., 1-byte, 2-byte, or longer), providing varying levels of validation strength.

The checksum ensures that an address is not modified or corrupted, adding an extra layer of security for account management.

### Validating Addresses

SS58 addresses can be validated using the subkey command-line interface or the Polkadot.js API. These tools help ensure an address is correctly formatted and valid for the intended network. The following sections will provide an overview of how validation works with these tools.

#### Using Subkey

[Subkey](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/subkey/index.html){target=\_blank} is a CLI tool provided by Polkadot SDK for generating and managing keys. It can inspect and validate SS58 addresses.

The `inspect` command gets a public key and an SS58 address from the provided secret URI. The basic syntax for the `subkey inspect` command is:

```bash
subkey inspect [flags] [options] uri
```

For the `uri` command-line argument, you can specify the secret seed phrase, a hex-encoded private key, or an SS58 address. If the input is a valid address, the `subkey` program displays the corresponding hex-encoded public key, account identifier, and SS58 addresses.

For example, to inspect the public keys derived from a secret seed phrase, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
subkey inspect "caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very"
```

The command displays output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>subkey inspect "caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very"</span>
  <span data-ty>Secret phrase `caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very` is account:</span>
  <span data-ty> Secret seed: 0xc8fa03532fb22ee1f7f6908b9c02b4e72483f0dbd66e4cd456b8f34c6230b849</span>
  <span data-ty> Public key (hex): 0xd6a3105d6768e956e9e5d41050ac29843f98561410d3a47f9dd5b3b227ab8746</span>
  <span data-ty> Public key (SS58): 5Gv8YYFu8H1btvmrJy9FjjAWfb99wrhV3uhPFoNEr918utyR</span>
  <span data-ty> Account ID: 0xd6a3105d6768e956e9e5d41050ac29843f98561410d3a47f9dd5b3b227ab8746</span>
  <span data-ty> SS58 Address: 5Gv8YYFu8H1btvmrJy9FjjAWfb99wrhV3uhPFoNEr918utyR</span>
</div>

The `subkey` program assumes an address is based on a public/private key pair. If you inspect an address, the command returns the 32-byte account identifier.

However, not all addresses in Polkadot SDK-based networks are based on keys.

Depending on the command-line options you specify and the input you provided, the command output might also display the network for which the address has been encoded. For example:

```bash
subkey inspect "12bzRJfh7arnnfPPUZHeJUaE62QLEwhK48QnH9LXeK2m1iZU"
```

The command displays output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>subkey inspect "12bzRJfh7arnnfPPUZHeJUaE62QLEwhK48QnH9LXeK2m1iZU"</span>
  <span data-ty>Public Key URI `12bzRJfh7arnnfPPUZHeJUaE62QLEwhK48QnH9LXeK2m1iZU` is account:</span>
  <span data-ty> Network ID/Version: polkadot</span>
  <span data-ty> Public key (hex): 0x46ebddef8cd9bb167dc30878d7113b7e168e6f0646beffd77d69d39bad76b47a</span>
  <span data-ty> Account ID: 0x46ebddef8cd9bb167dc30878d7113b7e168e6f0646beffd77d69d39bad76b47a</span>
  <span data-ty> Public key (SS58): 12bzRJfh7arnnfPPUZHeJUaE62QLEwhK48QnH9LXeK2m1iZU</span>
  <span data-ty> SS58 Address: 12bzRJfh7arnnfPPUZHeJUaE62QLEwhK48QnH9LXeK2m1iZU</span>
</div>

#### Using Polkadot.js API

To verify an address in JavaScript or TypeScript projects, you can use the functions built into the [Polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/){target=\_blank}. For example:

```js
// Import Polkadot.js API dependencies
const { decodeAddress, encodeAddress } = require('@polkadot/keyring');
const { hexToU8a, isHex } = require('@polkadot/util');

// Specify an address to test.
const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO_TEST';

// Check address
const isValidSubstrateAddress = () => {
  try {
    encodeAddress(isHex(address) ? hexToU8a(address) : decodeAddress(address));

    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    return false;
  }
};

// Query result
const isValid = isValidSubstrateAddress();
console.log(isValid);

```

If the function returns `true`, the specified address is a valid address.

#### Other SS58 Implementations

Support for encoding and decoding Polkadot SDK SS58 addresses has been implemented in several other languages and libraries.

- **Crystal**: [`wyhaines/base58.cr`](https://github.com/wyhaines/base58.cr){target=\_blank}
- **Go**: [`itering/subscan-plugin`](https://github.com/itering/subscan-plugin){target=\_blank}
- **Python**: [`polkascan/py-scale-codec`](https://github.com/polkascan/py-scale-codec){target=\_blank}
- **TypeScript**: [`subsquid/squid-sdk`](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-sdk){target=\_blank}

Page Title: Polkadot-API

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/reference-tools-papi.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/tools/papi/
- Summary: Polkadot-API (PAPI) is a modular, composable library set designed for efficient interaction with Polkadot chains, prioritizing a "light-client first" approach.

# Polkadot-API

## Introduction

[Polkadot-API](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api){target=\_blank} (PAPI) is a set of libraries built to be modular, composable, and grounded in a “light-client first” approach. Its primary aim is to equip dApp developers with an extensive toolkit for building fully decentralized applications.

PAPI is optimized for light-client functionality, using the new JSON-RPC spec to support decentralized interactions fully. It provides strong TypeScript support with types and documentation generated directly from on-chain metadata, and it offers seamless access to storage reads, constants, transactions, events, and runtime calls. Developers can connect to multiple chains simultaneously and prepare for runtime updates through multi-descriptor generation and compatibility checks. PAPI is lightweight and performant, leveraging native BigInt, dynamic imports, and modular subpaths to avoid bundling unnecessary assets. It supports promise-based and observable-based APIs, integrates easily with Polkadot.js extensions, and offers signing options through browser extensions or private keys.

## Get Started

### API Instantiation

To instantiate the API, you can install the package by using the following command:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm i polkadot-api@1.17.2
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm add polkadot-api@1.17.2
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add polkadot-api@1.17.2
    ```

Then, obtain the latest metadata from the target chain and generate the necessary types:

```bash
# Add the target chain
npx papi add dot -n polkadot
```

The `papi add` command initializes the library by generating the corresponding types needed for the chain used. It assigns the chain a custom name and specifies downloading metadata from the Polkadot chain. You can replace `dot` with the name you prefer or with another chain if you want to add a different one. Once the latest metadata is downloaded, generate the required types:

```bash
# Generate the necessary types
npx papi
```

You can now set up a [`PolkadotClient`](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/blob/main/packages/client/src/types.ts#L153){target=\_blank} with your chosen provider to begin interacting with the API. Choose from Smoldot via WebWorker, Node.js, or direct usage, or connect through the WSS provider. The examples below show how to configure each option for your setup.

=== "Smoldot (WebWorker)"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the identifier assigned during `npx papi add`
    import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
    import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
    import { getSmProvider } from 'polkadot-api/sm-provider';
    import { chainSpec } from 'polkadot-api/chains/polkadot';
    import { startFromWorker } from 'polkadot-api/smoldot/from-worker';
    import SmWorker from 'polkadot-api/smoldot/worker?worker';

    const worker = new SmWorker();
    const smoldot = startFromWorker(worker);
    const chain = await smoldot.addChain({ chainSpec });

    // Establish connection to the Polkadot relay chain
    const client = createClient(getSmProvider(chain));

    // To interact with the chain, obtain the `TypedApi`, which provides
    // the necessary types for every API call on this chain
    const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);

    ```

=== "Smoldot (Node.js)"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the alias assigned during `npx papi add`
    import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
    import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
    import { getSmProvider } from 'polkadot-api/sm-provider';
    import { chainSpec } from 'polkadot-api/chains/polkadot';
    import { startFromWorker } from 'polkadot-api/smoldot/from-node-worker';
    import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
    import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';

    // Get the path for the worker file in ESM
    const workerPath = fileURLToPath(
      import.meta.resolve('polkadot-api/smoldot/node-worker'),
    );

    const worker = new Worker(workerPath);
    const smoldot = startFromWorker(worker);
    const chain = await smoldot.addChain({ chainSpec });

    // Set up a client to connect to the Polkadot relay chain
    const client = createClient(getSmProvider(chain));

    // To interact with the chain's API, use `TypedApi` for access to
    // all the necessary types and calls associated with this chain
    const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);

    ```

=== "Smoldot"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the alias assigned when running `npx papi add`
    import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
    import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
    import { getSmProvider } from 'polkadot-api/sm-provider';
    import { chainSpec } from 'polkadot-api/chains/polkadot';
    import { start } from 'polkadot-api/smoldot';

    // Initialize Smoldot client
    const smoldot = start();
    const chain = await smoldot.addChain({ chainSpec });

    // Set up a client to connect to the Polkadot relay chain
    const client = createClient(getSmProvider(chain));

    // Access the `TypedApi` to interact with all available chain calls and types
    const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);

    ```

=== "WSS"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the identifier assigned when executing `npx papi add`
    import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
    import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
    // Use this import for Node.js environments
    import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider/web';
    import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';

    // Establish a connection to the Polkadot relay chain
    const client = createClient(
      // The Polkadot SDK nodes may have compatibility issues; using this enhancer is recommended.
      // Refer to the Requirements page for additional details
      withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('wss://dot-rpc.stakeworld.io')),
    );

    // To interact with the chain, obtain the `TypedApi`, which provides
    // the types for all available calls in that chain
    const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);

    ```

Now that you have set up the client, you can interact with the chain by reading and sending transactions.

### Reading Chain Data

The `TypedApi` provides a streamlined way to read blockchain data through three main interfaces, each designed for specific data access patterns:

- **Constants**: Access fixed values or configurations on the blockchain using the `constants` interface.

    ```typescript
    const version = await typedApi.constants.System.Version();
    ```

- **Storage queries**: Retrieve stored values by querying the blockchain’s storage via the `query` interface.

    ```typescript
    const asset = await api.query.ForeignAssets.Asset.getValue(
      token.location,
      { at: 'best' },
    );
    ```

- **Runtime APIs**: Interact directly with runtime APIs using the `apis` interface.

    ```typescript
    const metadata = await typedApi.apis.Metadata.metadata();
    ```

To learn more about the different actions you can perform with the `TypedApi`, refer to the [TypedApi reference](https://papi.how/typed){target=\_blank}.

### Sending Transactions

In PAPI, the `TypedApi` provides the `tx` and `txFromCallData` methods to send transactions. 

- The `tx` method allows you to directly send a transaction with the specified parameters by using the `typedApi.tx.Pallet.Call` pattern:

    ```typescript
    const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.Pallet.Call({arg1, arg2, arg3});
    ``` 

    For instance, to execute the `balances.transferKeepAlive` call, you can use the following snippet:

    ```typescript
    import { MultiAddress } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';

    const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.Balances.transfer_keep_alive({
      dest: MultiAddress.Id('INSERT_DESTINATION_ADDRESS'),
      value: BigInt(INSERT_VALUE),
    });

    ```

    Ensure you replace `INSERT_DESTINATION_ADDRESS` and `INSERT_VALUE` with the actual destination address and value, respectively.

- The `txFromCallData` method allows you to send a transaction using the call data. This option accepts binary call data and constructs the transaction from it. It validates the input upon creation and will throw an error if invalid data is provided. The pattern is as follows:

    ```typescript
    const callData = Binary.fromHex('0x...');
    const tx: Transaction = typedApi.txFromCallData(callData);
    ``` 

    For instance, to execute a transaction using the call data, you can use the following snippet:

    ```typescript
    const callData = Binary.fromHex('0x00002470617065726d6f6f6e');
    const tx: Transaction = typedApi.txFromCallData(callData);
    ```

- Summary: Interact with Polkadot SDK-based chains easily using the Polkadot.js API. Query chain data, submit transactions, and more via JavaScript or Typescript.

# Polkadot.js API

!!! warning "Maintenance Mode Only"
    The Polkadot.js API is now in maintenance mode and is no longer actively developed. New projects should use [Dedot](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/dedot){target=\_blank} (TypeScript-first API) or [Polkadot API](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/papi){target=\_blank} (modern, type-safe API) as actively maintained alternatives.

## Introduction

The [Polkadot.js API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api){target=\_blank} uses JavaScript/TypeScript to interact with Polkadot SDK-based chains. It allows you to query nodes, read chain state, and submit transactions through a dynamic, auto-generated API interface.

### Dynamic API Generation

Unlike traditional static APIs, the Polkadot.js API generates its interfaces automatically when connecting to a node. Here's what happens when you connect:

1. The API connects to your node.
2. It retrieves the chain's metadata.
3. Based on this metadata, it creates specific endpoints in this format: `api.<type>.<module>.<section>`.

### Available API Categories

You can access three main categories of chain interactions:

- **[Runtime constants](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.consts){target=\_blank}** (`api.consts`):

    - Access runtime constants directly.
    - Returns values immediately without function calls.
    - **Example**: `api.consts.balances.existentialDeposit`

- **[State queries](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.query/){target=\_blank}** (`api.query`):

    - Read chain state.
    - **Example**: `api.query.system.account(accountId)`

- **[Transactions](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.tx/){target=\_blank}** (`api.tx`):
    - Submit extrinsics (transactions).
    - **Example**: `api.tx.balances.transfer(accountId, value)`

The available methods and interfaces will automatically reflect what's possible on your connected chain.

## Installation

To add the Polkadot.js API to your project, use the following command to install the version `16.4.7` which supports any Polkadot SDK-based chain:

=== "npm"
    ```bash
    npm i @polkadot/api@16.4.7
    ```

=== "pnpm"
    ```bash
    pnpm add @polkadot/api@16.4.7
    ```

=== "yarn"
    ```bash
    yarn add @polkadot/api@16.4.7
    ```

For more detailed information about installation, see the [Installation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/install/){target=\_blank} section in the official Polkadot.js API documentation.

## Get Started

### Creating an API Instance

To interact with a Polkadot SDK-based chain, you must establish a connection through an API instance. The API provides methods for querying chain state, sending transactions, and subscribing to updates.

To create an API connection:

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

// Create a WebSocket provider
const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io');

// Initialize the API
const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });

// Verify the connection by getting the chain's genesis hash
console.log('Genesis Hash:', api.genesisHash.toHex());

```

!!!warning
    All `await` operations must be wrapped in an async function or block since the API uses promises for asynchronous operations.

### Reading Chain Data

The API provides several ways to read data from the chain. You can access:

- **Constants**: Values that are fixed in the runtime and don't change without a runtime upgrade.

    ```js
    // Get the minimum balance required for a new account
    const minBalance = api.consts.balances.existentialDeposit.toNumber();

    ```

- **State**: Current chain state that updates with each block.

    ```js
    // Example address
    const address = '5DTestUPts3kjeXSTMyerHihn1uwMfLj8vU8sqF7qYrFabHE';

    // Get current timestamp
    const timestamp = await api.query.timestamp.now();

    // Get account information
    const { nonce, data: balance } = await api.query.system.account(address);

    console.log(`
      Timestamp: ${timestamp}
      Free Balance: ${balance.free}
      Nonce: ${nonce}
    `);

    ```

### Sending Transactions

Transactions (also called extrinsics) modify the chain state. Before sending a transaction, you need:

- A funded account with sufficient balance to pay transaction fees.
- The account's keypair for signing.

To make a transfer:

```js
// Assuming you have an `alice` keypair from the Keyring
const recipient = 'INSERT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS';
const amount = 'INSERT_VALUE'; // Amount in the smallest unit (e.g., Planck for DOT)

// Sign and send a transfer
const txHash = await api.tx.balances
  .transfer(recipient, amount)
  .signAndSend(alice);

console.log('Transaction Hash:', txHash);

```

The `alice` keypair in the example comes from a `Keyring` object. For more details about managing keypairs, see the [Keyring documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/keyring){target=\_blank}.

Page Title: Python Substrate Interface

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/reference-tools-py-substrate-interface.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/tools/py-substrate-interface/
- Summary: Learn how to connect to Polkadot SDK-based nodes, query data, submit transactions, and manage blockchain interactions using the Python Substrate Interface.

# Python Substrate Interface

## Introduction

The [Python Substrate Interface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface){target=\_blank} is a powerful library that enables interaction with Polkadot SDK-based chains. It provides essential functionality for:

- Querying on-chain storage.
- Composing and submitting extrinsics.
- SCALE encoding/decoding.
- Interacting with Substrate runtime metadata.
- Managing blockchain interactions through convenient utility methods.

## Installation

Install the library using `pip`:

```py
pip install substrate-interface
```

For more installation details, see the [Installation](https://jamdottech.github.io/py-polkadot-sdk/getting-started/installation/){target=\_blank} section in the official Python Substrate Interface documentation.

## Get Started

This guide will walk you through the basic operations with the Python Substrate Interface: connecting to a node, reading chain state, and submitting transactions.

### Establishing Connection

The first step is to establish a connection to a Polkadot SDK-based node. You can connect to either a local or remote node:

```py
from substrateinterface import SubstrateInterface

# Connect to a node using websocket
substrate = SubstrateInterface(
    # For local node: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944"
    # For Polkadot: "wss://rpc.polkadot.io"
    # For Kusama: "wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io"
    url="INSERT_WS_URL"
)

# Verify connection
print(f"Connected to chain: {substrate.chain}")

```

### Reading Chain State

You can query various on-chain storage items. To retrieve data, you need to specify three key pieces of information:

- **Pallet name**: Module or pallet that contains the storage item you want to access.
- **Storage item**: Specific storage entry you want to query within the pallet.
- **Required parameters**: Any parameters needed to retrieve the desired data.

Here's an example of how to check an account's balance and other details:

```py
# ...

# Query account balance and info
account_info = substrate.query(
    module="System",  # The pallet name
    storage_function="Account",  # The storage item
    params=["INSERT_ADDRESS"],  # Account address in SS58 format
)

# Access account details from the result
free_balance = account_info.value["data"]["free"]
reserved = account_info.value["data"]["reserved"]
nonce = account_info.value["nonce"]

print(
    f"""
    Account Details:
    - Free Balance: {free_balance}
    - Reserved: {reserved} 
    - Nonce: {nonce}
    """
)

```

### Submitting Transactions

To modify the chain state, you need to submit transactions (extrinsics). Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- A funded account with sufficient balance to pay transaction fees.
- Access to the account's keypair.

Here's how to create and submit a balance transfer:

```py
#...

# Compose the transfer call
call = substrate.compose_call(
    call_module="Balances",  # The pallet name
    call_function="transfer_keep_alive",  # The extrinsic function
    call_params={
        'dest': 'INSERT_ADDRESS',  # Recipient's address
        'value': 'INSERT_VALUE'  # Amount in smallest unit (e.g., Planck for DOT)
    }

# Query Account Information with SDKs

## Introduction

Querying account information is a fundamental operation when interacting with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. Account queries allow you to retrieve balances, nonces, account data, and other state information stored on-chain. Each SDK provides different methods for accessing this data efficiently.

This guide demonstrates how to query account information using five popular SDKs:

- **[Polkadot API (PAPI)](/reference/tools/papi/){target=\_blank}**: Modern TypeScript library with type-safe APIs
- **[Polkadot.js API](/reference/tools/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}**: Comprehensive JavaScript library (maintenance mode)
- **[Dedot](/reference/tools/dedot/){target=\_blank}**: Lightweight TypeScript library optimized for performance
- **[Python Substrate Interface](/reference/tools/py-substrate-interface/){target=\_blank}**: Python library for Substrate chains
- **[Subxt](/reference/tools/subxt/){target=\_blank}**: Rust library with compile-time type safety

Select your preferred SDK below to see complete, runnable examples that query account information on Polkadot Hub.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Polkadot SDK-compatible blockchain endpoint (WebSocket URL)
- An account address to query (can be any valid SS58 address)

## Query Account Information

=== "PAPI"

    **Prerequisites**

    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/){target=\_blank} v18 or higher
    - npm, pnpm, or yarn package manager

    **Environment Setup**

    1. Create and initialize a new project:

        ```bash
        mkdir papi-query-account-example && cd papi-query-account-example && \
        npm init -y && npm pkg set type=module
        ```

    2. Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install polkadot-api && \
        npm install --save-dev @types/node tsx typescript
        ```

    3. Generate types for Polkadot Hub:

        ```bash
        npx papi add polkadotTestNet -w wss://asset-hub-paseo.dotters.network
        ```

    **Query Account Data**

    The following example queries account information including balance, nonce, and other account data.

    Create a file named `query-account.ts` and add the following code to it:

    ```typescript title="query-account.ts"
    import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
    import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider';
    import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';
    import { polkadotTestNet } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';

    const POLKADOT_HUB_RPC = 'INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT';
    const ACCOUNT_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS';
    const PAS_UNITS = 10_000_000_000;

    async function main() {
      try {
        // Create the client connection
        const client = createClient(
          withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider(POLKADOT_HUB_RPC))
        );

        // Get the typed API
        const api = client.getTypedApi(polkadotTestNet);
        console.log('Connected to Polkadot Hub');

        console.log(`\nQuerying account: ${ACCOUNT_ADDRESS}\n`);

        // Query account information
        const accountInfo = await api.query.System.Account.getValue(
          ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
        );

        // Display account information
        console.log('Account Information:');
        console.log('===================');
        console.log(`Nonce: ${accountInfo.nonce}`);
        console.log(`Consumers: ${accountInfo.consumers}`);
        console.log(`Providers: ${accountInfo.providers}`);
        console.log(`Sufficients: ${accountInfo.sufficients}`);

        console.log('\nBalance Details:');
        console.log('================');
        console.log(
          `Free Balance: ${accountInfo.data.free} (${
            Number(accountInfo.data.free) / PAS_UNITS
          } PAS)`
        );
        console.log(
          `Reserved Balance: ${accountInfo.data.reserved} (${
            Number(accountInfo.data.reserved) / PAS_UNITS
          } PAS)`
        );
        console.log(
          `Frozen Balance: ${accountInfo.data.frozen} (${
            Number(accountInfo.data.frozen) / PAS_UNITS
          } PAS)`
        );

        const total =
          Number(accountInfo.data.free) + Number(accountInfo.data.reserved);
        console.log(`\nTotal Balance: ${total} (${total / PAS_UNITS} PAS)`);

        await client.destroy();
        console.log('\nDisconnected');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        process.exit(1);
      }
    }

    main();

    ```

    !!! note    
        Ensure to replace `INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT` with a valid WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `wss://asset-hub-paseo.dotters.network`) and `INSERT_ADDRESS` with the account address you want to query.

    Run the script:

    ```bash
    npx tsx query-account.ts
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    <div class="termynal" data-termynal>

=== "Subxt"

    **Prerequisites**

    - [Rust](https://rustup.rs/){target=\_blank} toolchain (latest stable)
    - Cargo package manager

    **Environment Setup**

    1. Create a new Rust project:

        ```bash
        cargo new subxt-query-account-example && cd subxt-query-account-example
        ```

    2. Install the Subxt CLI:

        ```bash
        cargo install subxt-cli@0.35.3
        ```

    3. Download the Polkadot Hub metadata:

        ```bash
        subxt metadata --url INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT -o polkadot_testnet_metadata.scale
        ```

    4. Update `Cargo.toml` with the required dependencies:

        ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
        [package]
        name = "subxt-query-account-example"
        version = "0.1.0"
        edition = "2021"

        [[bin]]
        name = "query_account"
        path = "src/bin/query_account.rs"

        [dependencies]
        subxt = { version = "0.44.0" }
        tokio = { version = "1.36.0", features = ["macros", "rt"] }
        ```

    **Query Account Data**

    The following example queries account information including balance, nonce, and other account data.

    Create a file at `src/bin/query_account.rs` and add the following code to it:

    ```rust title="src/bin/query_account.rs"
    use std::str::FromStr;
    use subxt::utils::AccountId32;
    use subxt::{OnlineClient, PolkadotConfig};

    // Generate an interface from the node's metadata
    #[subxt::subxt(runtime_metadata_path = "polkadot_testnet_metadata.scale")]
    pub mod polkadot_testnet {}

    const POLKADOT_TESTNET_RPC: &str = "INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT";
    const ACCOUNT_ADDRESS: &str = "INSERT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS";
    const PAS_UNITS: u128 = 10_000_000_000;

    #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
    async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        // Initialize the Subxt client
        let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::from_url(POLKADOT_TESTNET_RPC).await?;

        println!("Connected to Polkadot Hub");

        // Convert the account address into an AccountId32
        let account = AccountId32::from_str(ACCOUNT_ADDRESS)?;

        println!("\nQuerying account: {}\n", account);

        // Query account information
        let storage_query = polkadot_testnet::storage().system().account(account);
        let account_info = api
            .storage()
            .at_latest()
            .await?
            .fetch(&storage_query)
            .await?;

        if let Some(info) = account_info {
            // Display account information
            println!("Account Information:");
            println!("===================");
            println!("Nonce: {}", info.nonce);
            println!("Consumers: {}", info.consumers);
            println!("Providers: {}", info.providers);
            println!("Sufficients: {}", info.sufficients);

            println!("\nBalance Details:");
            println!("================");
            println!(
                "Free Balance: {} ({} PAS)",
                info.data.free,
                info.data.free as f64 / PAS_UNITS as f64
            );
            println!(
                "Reserved Balance: {} ({} PAS)",
                info.data.reserved,
                info.data.reserved as f64 / PAS_UNITS as f64
            );
            println!(
                "Frozen Balance: {} ({} PAS)",
                info.data.frozen,
                info.data.frozen as f64 / PAS_UNITS as f64
            );

            let total = info.data.free + info.data.reserved;
            println!(
                "\nTotal Balance: {} ({} PAS)",
                total,
                total as f64 / PAS_UNITS as f64
            );
        } else {
            println!("Account not found or has no data");
        }

        println!("\nDisconnected");

        Ok(())
    }
    ```

    !!! note    
        Ensure to replace `INSERT_WS_ENDPOINT` with a valid WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `wss://asset-hub-paseo.dotters.network`) and `INSERT_ADDRESS` with the account address you want to query.

    Run the script:

    ```bash
    cargo run --bin query_account
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    <div class="termynal" data-termynal>
        <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>cargo run --bin query_account</span>

        <span data-ty></span>
        <span data-ty>Disconnected</span>
    </div>
## Understanding Account Data

When querying account information, you'll receive several key fields:

- **Nonce**: The number of transactions sent from this account, used to prevent replay attacks.
- **Consumers**: The number of modules depending on this account's existence.
- **Providers**: The number of modules providing for this account's existence.
- **Sufficients**: The number of modules that allow this account to exist on its own.
- **Free Balance**: The transferable balance available for transactions.
- **Reserved Balance**: Balance that is locked for specific purposes (staking, governance, etc.).
- **Frozen Balance**: Balance that cannot be used for transfers but may be used for other operations.

The total balance is the sum of free and reserved balances.

# Randomness

## Introduction

Randomness is crucial in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains to ensure a fair and unpredictable distribution of validator duties. However, computers are inherently deterministic, meaning the same input always produces the same output. What we typically refer to as "random" numbers on a computer are actually pseudo-random. These numbers rely on an initial "seed," which can come from external sources like [atmospheric noise](https://www.random.org/randomness/){target=\_blank}, [heart rates](https://mdpi.altmetric.com/details/47574324){target=\_blank}, or even [lava lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand){target=\_blank}. While this may seem random, given the same "seed," the same sequence of numbers will always be generated.

In a global blockchain network, relying on real-world entropy for randomness isn’t feasible because these inputs vary by time and location. If nodes use different inputs, blockchains can fork. Hence, real-world randomness isn't suitable for use as a seed in blockchain systems.

Currently, two primary methods for generating randomness in blockchains are used: [`RANDAO`](#randao) and [`VRF`](#vrf) (Verifiable Random Function). Polkadot adopts the `VRF` approach for its randomness.

## VRF

A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a cryptographic function that generates a random number and proof that ensures the submitter produced the number. This proof allows anyone to verify the validity of the random number.

Polkadot's VRF is similar to the one used in [**Ouroboros Praos**](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf){target=\_blank}, which secures randomness for block production in systems like [BABE](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/pos-consensus/#block-production-babe){target=\_blank} (Polkadot’s block production mechanism). 

The key difference is that Polkadot's VRF doesn’t rely on a central clock—avoiding the issue of whose clock to trust. Instead, it uses its own past results and slot numbers to simulate time and determine future outcomes.

### How VRF Works

Slots on Polkadot are discrete units of time, each lasting six seconds, and can potentially hold a block. Multiple slots form an epoch, with 2400 slots making up one four-hour epoch.

In each slot, validators execute a "die roll" using a VRF. The VRF uses three inputs:

1. A "secret key," unique to each validator, is used for the die roll.
2. An epoch randomness value, derived from the hash of VRF outputs from blocks two epochs ago (N-2), so past randomness influences the current epoch (N).
3. The current slot number.

This process helps maintain fair randomness across the network.

Here is a graphical representation:

![](/images/reference/parachains/randomness/randomness-01.webp)

The VRF produces two outputs: a result (the random number) and a proof (verifying that the number was generated correctly).

The result is checked by the validator against a protocol threshold. If it's below the threshold, the validator becomes a candidate for block production in that slot. 

The validator then attempts to create a block, submitting it along with the `PROOF` and `RESULT`.

So, VRF can be expressed like:

`(RESULT, PROOF) = VRF(SECRET, EPOCH_RANDOMNESS_VALUE, CURRENT_SLOT_NUMBER)`

Put simply, performing a "VRF roll" generates a random number along with proof that the number was genuinely produced and not arbitrarily chosen.

After executing the VRF, the `RESULT` is compared to a protocol-defined `THRESHOLD`. If the `RESULT` is below the `THRESHOLD`, the validator becomes a valid candidate to propose a block for that slot. Otherwise, the validator skips the slot.

As a result, there may be multiple validators eligible to propose a block for a slot. In this case, the block accepted by other nodes will prevail, provided it is on the chain with the latest finalized block as determined by the GRANDPA finality gadget. It's also possible for no block producers to be available for a slot, in which case the AURA consensus takes over. AURA is a fallback mechanism that randomly selects a validator to produce a block, running in parallel with BABE and only stepping in when no block producers exist for a slot. Otherwise, it remains inactive.

Because validators roll independently, no block candidates may appear in some slots if all roll numbers are above the threshold. 

To verify resolution of this issue and that Polkadot block times remain near constant-time, see the [PoS Consensus](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank} page of this documentation.

## RANDAO

An alternative on-chain randomness method is Ethereum's RANDAO, where validators perform thousands of hashes on a seed and publish the final hash during a round. The collective input from all validators forms the random number, and as long as one honest validator participates, the randomness is secure.

To enhance security, RANDAO can optionally be combined with a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), ensuring that randomness can't be predicted or manipulated during computation.

For more information about RANDAO, see the [Randomness - RANDAO](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/randomness/){target=\_blank} section of the Upgrading Ethereum documentation.

## VDFs

Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) are time-bound computations that, even on parallel computers, take a set amount of time to complete. 

They produce a unique result that can be quickly verified publicly. When combined with RANDAO, feeding RANDAO's output into a VDF introduces a delay that nullifies an attacker's chance to influence the randomness.

However, VDF likely requires specialized ASIC devices to run separately from standard nodes.

!!!warning 
    While only one is needed to secure the system, and they will be open-source and inexpensive, running VDF devices involves significant costs without direct incentives, adding friction for blockchain users.

Page Title: Register a Local Asset

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/chain-interactions-token-operations-register-local-asset.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/
- Summary: Comprehensive guide to registering a local asset on the Asset Hub system parachain, including step-by-step instructions.

# Register a Local Asset on Asset Hub

## Introduction

As detailed in the [Asset Hub Overview](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub){target=\_blank} page, Asset Hub accommodates two types of assets: local and foreign. Local assets are those that were created in Asset Hub and are identifiable by an integer ID. On the other hand, foreign assets originate from a sibling parachain and are identified by a Multilocation.

This guide will take you through the steps of registering a local asset on the Asset Hub parachain.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have access to the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface and a funded wallet with DOT or KSM.

- For Polkadot Asset Hub, you would need a deposit of 10 DOT and around 0.201 DOT for the metadata.
- For Kusama Asset Hub, the deposit is 0.1 KSM and around 0.000669 KSM for the metadata.

You need to ensure that your Asset Hub account balance is a bit more than the sum of those two deposits, which should seamlessly account for the required deposits and transaction fees.

## Register a Local Asset

To register a local asset on the Asset Hub parachain, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface and connect to the Asset Hub parachain using the network selector in the top left corner.

      - You may prefer to test local asset registration on TestNet before registering the asset on a MainNet hub. If you still need to set up a local testing environment, review the [Environment setup](#test-setup-environment) section for instructions. Once the local environment is set up, connect to the Local Node (Chopsticks) available on `ws://127.0.0.1:8000`.
      - For the live network, connect to the **Asset Hub** parachain. Either Polkadot or Kusama Asset Hub can be selected from the dropdown list, choosing the desired RPC provider.

2. Click on the **Network** tab on the top navigation bar and select **Assets** from the dropdown list.

      ![Access to Asset Hub through Polkadot.JS](/images/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/register-a-local-asset-01.webp)

3. Now, you need to examine all the registered asset IDs. This step is crucial to ensure that the asset ID you are about to register is unique. Asset IDs are displayed in the **assets** column.

      ![Asset IDs on Asset Hub](/images/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/register-a-local-asset-02.webp)

4. Once you have confirmed that the asset ID is unique, click on the **Create** button on the top right corner of the page.

      ![Create a new asset](/images/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/register-a-local-asset-03.webp)

5. Fill in the required fields in the **Create Asset** form:

    1. **creator account**: The account to be used for creating this asset and setting up the initial metadata.
    2. **asset name**: The descriptive name of the asset you are registering.
    3. **asset symbol**: The symbol that will be used to represent the asset.
    4. **asset decimals**: The number of decimal places for this token, with a maximum of 20 allowed through the user interface.
    5. **minimum balance**: The minimum balance for the asset. This is specified in the units and decimals as requested.
    6. **asset ID**: The selected id for the asset. This should not match an already-existing asset id.
    7. Click on the **Next** button.
 
    ![Create Asset Form](/images/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/register-a-local-asset-04.webp)

6. Choose the accounts for the roles listed below:

    1. **admin account**: The account designated for continuous administration of the token.
    2. **issuer account**: The account that will be used for issuing this token.
    3. **freezer account**: The account that will be used for performing token freezing operations.
    4. Click on the **Create** button.

    ![Admin, Issuer, Freezer accounts](/images/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/register-a-local-asset-05.webp)

7. Click on the **Sign and Submit** button to complete the asset registration process.

    ![Sign and Submit](/images/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/register-a-local-asset-06.webp)

## Verify Asset Registration

After completing these steps, the asset will be successfully registered. You can now view your asset listed on the [**Assets**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fasset-hub-polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/assets){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot.js Apps interface.

![Asset listed on Polkadot.js Apps](/images/chain-interactions/token-operations/register-local-asset/register-a-local-asset-07.webp)

!!! tip
    Take into consideration that the **Assets** section’s link may differ depending on the network you are using. For the local environment, enter `ws://127.0.0.1:8000` into the **Custom Endpoint** field.

In this way, you have successfully registered a local asset on the Asset Hub parachain.

For an in-depth explanation about Asset Hub and its features, see the [Asset Hub](/chain-interactions/token-operations/convert-assets/){target=\_blank} entry in the Polkadot Wiki.

## Test Setup Environment

You can set up a local parachain environment to test the asset registration process before deploying it on the live network. This guide uses Chopsticks to simulate that process. For further information on chopsticks usage, refer to the [Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started){target=\_blank} documentation.

To set up a test environment, execute the following command:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
--config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot-asset-hub.yml
```

The above command will spawn a lazy fork of Polkadot Asset Hub with the latest block data from the network. If you need to test Kusama Asset Hub, replace `polkadot-asset-hub.yml` with `kusama-asset-hub.yml` in the command.

An Asset Hub instance is now running locally, and you can proceed with the asset registration process. Note that the local registration process does not differ from the live network process. Once you have a successful TestNet transaction, you can use the same steps to register the asset on MainNet.

- Summary: Quickly install and configure Zombienet to deploy and test Polkadot-based blockchain networks with this comprehensive getting-started guide.

# Run a Parachain Network Using Zombienet

## Introduction

Zombienet is a robust testing framework designed for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. It enables developers to efficiently deploy and test ephemeral blockchain environments on platforms like Kubernetes, Podman, and native setups. With its simple and versatile CLI, Zombienet provides an all-in-one solution for spawning networks, running tests, and validating performance.

This guide will outline the different installation methods for Zombienet, provide step-by-step instructions for setting up on various platforms, and highlight essential provider-specific features and requirements.

By following this guide, Zombienet will be up and running quickly, ready to streamline your blockchain testing and development workflows.

## Install Zombienet

Zombienet releases are available on the [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=\_blank}.

Multiple options are available for installing Zombienet, depending on the user's preferences and the environment where it will be used. The following section will guide you through the installation process for each option.

=== "Use the executable"

    Install Zombienet using executables by visiting the [latest release](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases){target=\_blank} page and selecting the appropriate asset for your operating system. You can download the executable and move it to a directory in your PATH. 

    Each release includes executables for Linux and macOS. Executables are generated using [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg){target=\_blank}, which allows the Zombienet CLI to operate without requiring Node.js to be installed. 

    Then, ensure the downloaded file is executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x zombienet-macos-arm64
    ```

    Finally, you can run the following command to check if the installation was successful. If so, it will display the version of the installed Zombienet:

    ```bash
    ./zombienet-macos-arm64 version
    ```

    If you want to add the `zombienet` executable to your PATH, you can move it to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

    ```bash
    mv zombienet-macos-arm64 /usr/local/bin/zombienet
    ```

    Now you can refer to the `zombienet` executable directly.

    ```bash
    zombienet version
    ```

=== "Use Nix"

    For Nix users, the Zombienet repository provides a [`flake.nix`](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/blob/main/flake.nix){target=\_blank} file to install Zombienet making it easy to incorporate Zombienet into Nix-based projects.
    
    To install Zombienet utilizing Nix, users can run the following command, triggering the fetching of the flake and subsequently installing the Zombienet package:

    ```bash
    nix run github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION -- \
    spawn INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME.toml
    ```

    Replace the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION` with the desired version of Zombienet and the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME` with the name of the configuration file you want to use.

    To run the command above, you need to have [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes){target=\_blank} enabled.

    Alternatively, you can also include the Zombienet binary in the PATH for the current shell using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    nix shell github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION
    ```

=== "Use Docker"

    Zombienet can also be run using Docker. The Zombienet repository provides a Docker image that can be used to run the Zombienet CLI. To run Zombienet using Docker, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files \
    paritytech/zombienet
    ```

    The command above will run the Zombienet CLI inside a Docker container and mount the current directory to the `/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files` directory. This allows Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

    Inside the Docker container, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. First, you need to set up Zombienet to download the necessary binaries:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    After that, you need to add those binaries to the PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/home/nonroot/zombie-net:$PATH
    ```

    Finally, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. For example, to spawn a network using a specific configuration file, you can run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- -p native spawn host-current-files/minimal.toml
    ```

    The command above mounts the current directory to the `/workspace` directory inside the Docker container, allowing Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

## Providers

Zombienet supports different backend providers for running the nodes. At this moment, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){target=\_blank}, [Podman](https://podman.io/){target=\_blank}, and local providers are supported, which can be declared as `kubernetes`, `podman`, or `native`, respectively.

To use a particular provider, you can specify it in the network file or use the `--provider` flag in the CLI:

```bash
zombienet spawn network.toml --provider INSERT_PROVIDER
```

Alternatively, you can set the provider in the network file:

```toml
[settings]
provider = "INSERT_PROVIDER"
...
```

It's important to note that each provider has specific requirements and associated features. The following sections cover each provider's requirements and added features.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Zombienet is designed to be compatible with a variety of Kubernetes clusters, including: 

- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine){target=\_blank}
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/kubernetes/){target=\_blank}
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/){target=\_blank}

#### Requirements
    
To effectively interact with your cluster, you'll need to ensure that [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/){target=\_blank} is installed on your system. This Kubernetes command-line tool allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. If you don't have `kubectl` installed, you can follow the instructions provided in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl){target=\_blank}.

To create resources such as namespaces, pods, and CronJobs within the target cluster, you must grant your user or service account the appropriate permissions. These permissions are essential for managing and deploying applications effectively within Kubernetes.

#### Features
    
If available, Zombienet uses the Prometheus operator to oversee monitoring and visibility. This configuration ensures that only essential networking-related pods are deployed. Using the Prometheus operator, Zombienet improves its ability to monitor and manage network activities within the Kubernetes cluster efficiently.  

### Podman

Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and container images on Linux-based systems. Zombienet supports Podman rootless as a provider on Linux machines. Although Podman has support for macOS through an internal virtual machine (VM), the Zombienet provider code requires Podman to run natively on Linux.

#### Requirements
     
To use Podman as a provider, you need to have Podman installed on your system. You can install Podman by following the instructions provided on the [Podman website](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank}.

#### Features
    
Using Podman, Zombienet deploys additional pods to enhance the monitoring and visibility of the active network. Specifically, pods for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank}, [Tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/operations/monitor/){target=\_blank}, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/){target=\_blank} are included in the deployment. Grafana is configured with Prometheus and Tempo as data sources.

Upon launching Zombienet, access to these monitoring services is facilitated through specific URLs provided in the output:

- **Prometheus**: `http://127.0.0.1:34123`
- **Tempo**: `http://127.0.0.1:34125`
- **Grafana**: `http://127.0.0.1:41461`

It's important to note that Grafana is deployed with default administrator access. 
    
When network operations cease, either from halting a running spawn with the `Ctrl+C` command or test completion, Zombienet automatically removes all associated pods.

### Local Provider

The Zombienet local provider, also called native, enables you to run nodes as local processes in your environment.

#### Requirements
     
You must have the necessary binaries for your network (such as `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain`). These binaries should be available in your PATH, allowing Zombienet to spawn the nodes as local processes.

To install the necessary binaries, you can use the Zombienet CLI command:

```bash
zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
```

This command will download and prepare the necessary binaries for Zombienet's use.

If you need to use a custom binary, ensure the binary is available in your PATH. You can also specify the binary path in the network configuration file. The following example uses the custom [OpenZeppelin template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates){target=\_blank}:

First, clone the OpenZeppelin template repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates \
&& cd polkadot-runtime-templates/generic-template
```

Next, run the command to build the custom binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Finally, add the custom binary to your PATH as follows:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:INSERT_PATH_TO_RUNTIME_TEMPLATES/parachain-template-node/target/release
```

Alternatively, you can specify the binary path in the network configuration file. The local provider exclusively utilizes the command configuration for nodes, which supports both relative and absolute paths. You can employ the `default_command` configuration to specify the binary for spawning all nodes in the relay chain.

```toml
[relaychain]
chain = "rococo-local"
default_command = "./bin-v1.6.0/polkadot"

[parachain]
id = 1000

    [parachain.collators]
    name = "collator01"
    command = "./target/release/parachain-template-node"
```

#### Features

The local provider does not offer any additional features.

## Configure Zombienet

Effective network configuration is crucial for deploying and managing blockchain systems. Zombienet simplifies this process by offering versatile configuration options in both JSON and TOML formats. Whether setting up a simple test network or a complex multi-node system, Zombienet's tools provide the flexibility to customize every aspect of your network's setup.

The following sections will explore the structure and usage of Zombienet configuration files, explain key settings for network customization, and walk through CLI commands and flags to optimize your development workflow.

### Configuration Files

The network configuration file can be either JSON or TOML format. The Zombienet repository also provides a collection of [example configuration files](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/tree/main/examples){target=\_blank} that can be used as a reference.

Each section may include provider-specific keys that aren't recognized by other providers. For example, if you use the local provider, any references to images for nodes will be disregarded.

### CLI Usage

Zombienet provides a CLI that allows interaction with the tool. The CLI can receive commands and flags to perform different kinds of operations. These operations use the following syntax:

```bash
zombienet <arguments> <commands>
```

The following sections will guide you through the primary usage of the Zombienet CLI and the available commands and flags.

#### CLI Commands

- **`spawn <networkConfig>`**: Spawn the network defined in the [configuration file](#configuration-files).
- **`test <testFile>`**: Run tests on the spawned network using the assertions and tests defined in the test file.
- **`setup <binaries>`**: Set up the Zombienet development environment to download and use the `polkadot` or `polkadot-parachain` executable.
- **`convert <filePath>`**: Transforms a [polkadot-launch](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch){target=\_blank} configuration file with a `.js` or `.json` extension into a Zombienet configuration file.
- **`version`**: Prints Zombienet version.
- **`help`**: Prints help information.

#### CLI Flags

You can use the following flags to customize the behavior of the CLI:

- **`-p`, `--provider`**: Override the [provider](#providers) to use.
- **`-d`, `--dir`**: Specify a directory path for placing the network files instead of using the default temporary path.
- **`-f`, `--force`**: Force override all prompt commands.

- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/parachains/launch-a-parachain/set-up-the-parachain-template/
- Summary: Learn how to set up and run the Polkadot SDK Parachain Template locally, creating a ready-to-customize foundation for your parachain.

# Set Up the Polkadot SDK Parachain Template

## Introduction

The [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank} includes several [templates](/parachains/customize-runtime/#starting-templates){target=\_blank} designed to help you quickly start building your own blockchain. Each template offers a different level of configuration, from minimal setups to feature-rich environments, allowing you to choose the foundation that best fits your project's needs.

Among these, the [Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template){target=\_blank} provides a preconfigured runtime with commonly used pallets, making it an ideal starting point for most parachain development projects.

This guide walks you through the full process of working with this template. You will:

- Set up the Polkadot SDK Parachain Template.
- Understand the project structure and key components.
- Verify your template is ready for development.
- Run the parachain template locally in development mode.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a working template ready to customize and deploy as a parachain.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have done the following:

- Completed the [Install Polkadot SDK](/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank} guide and successfully installed [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} and the required packages to set up your development environment.

For this tutorial series, you need to use Rust `1.86`. Newer versions of the compiler may not work with this parachain template version.

Run the following commands to set up the correct Rust version:

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    rustup install 1.86
    rustup default 1.86
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.86-aarch64-apple-darwin
    rustup component add rust-src --toolchain 1.86-aarch64-apple-darwin
    ```

=== "Ubuntu"

    ```bash
    rustup toolchain install 1.86.0
    rustup default 1.86.0
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.86.0
    rustup component add rust-src --toolchain 1.86.0
    ```

## Polkadot SDK Utility Tools

This tutorial requires two essential tools:

- [**Chain spec builder**](https://crates.io/crates/staging-chain-spec-builder/10.0.0){target=\_blank}: A Polkadot SDK utility for generating chain specifications. Refer to the [Generate Chain Specs](/parachains/launch-a-parachain/deploy-to-polkadot/#generate-the-chain-specification){target=\_blank} documentation for detailed usage.
    
    Install it by executing the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo install --locked staging-chain-spec-builder@10.0.0
    ```

    This command installs the `chain-spec-builder` binary.

- [**Polkadot Omni Node**](https://crates.io/crates/polkadot-omni-node/0.5.0){target=\_blank}: A white-labeled binary, released as a part of Polkadot SDK that can act as the collator of a parachain in production, with all the related auxiliary functionalities that a normal collator node has: RPC server, archiving state, etc. Moreover, it can also run the Wasm blob of the parachain locally for testing and development.

    To install it, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo install --locked polkadot-omni-node@0.5.0
    ```

    This command installs the `polkadot-omni-node` binary.

## Clone the Template

The [Polkadot SDK Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template){target=\_blank} provides a ready-to-use development environment for building with the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank}. Follow these steps to set up the template:

1. Clone the template repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template.git parachain-template
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd parachain-template
    ```

## Explore the Project Structure

Before building the template, take a moment to familiarize yourself with its structure. Understanding this organization will help you navigate the codebase as you develop your parachain.

The template follows a standard Polkadot SDK project layout:

```text
parachain-template/
├── node/              # Node implementation and client
├── pallets/           # Custom pallets for your parachain
├── runtime/           # Runtime configuration and logic
├── Cargo.toml         # Workspace configuration
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

Key directories explained:

- **runtime/**: Contains your parachain's state transition function and pallet configuration. This is where you'll define what your blockchain can do.
- **node/**: Houses the client implementation that runs your blockchain, handles networking, and manages the database.
- **pallets/**: Where you'll create custom business logic modules (pallets) for your specific use case.
- **Cargo.toml**: The workspace configuration that ties all components together.

!!!note
    The runtime is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm), enabling forkless upgrades. The node binary remains constant while the runtime can be updated on-chain.

## Compile the Runtime

Now that you understand the template structure, let's compile the runtime to ensure everything is working correctly.

1. Compile the runtime:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release --locked
    ```

    !!!tip
        Initial compilation may take several minutes, depending on your machine specifications. Use the `--release` flag for improved runtime performance compared to the default `--debug` build. If you need to troubleshoot issues, the `--debug` build provides better diagnostics.
        
        For production deployments, consider using a dedicated `--profile production` flag - this can provide an additional 15-30% performance improvement over the standard `--release` profile.

2. Upon successful compilation, you should see output indicating the build was successful. The compiled runtime will be located at:
    
    `./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm`

## Verify the Build

After compilation completes, verify that the runtime was created successfully by checking for the Wasm blob:

```bash
ls -la ./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/
```

You should see the `parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm` file in the output, confirming the build was successful.

## Run the Node Locally

After successfully compiling your runtime, you can spin up a local chain and produce blocks. This process will start your local parachain using the Polkadot Omni Node and allow you to interact with it. You'll first need to generate a chain specification that defines your network's identity, initial connections, and genesis state, providing the foundational configuration for how your nodes connect and what initial state they agree upon.

Follow these steps to launch your node in development mode:

1. Generate the chain specification file of your parachain:

    ```bash
    chain-spec-builder create -t development \
    --relay-chain paseo \
    --para-id 1000 \
    --runtime ./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
    named-preset development
    ```

2. Start the Omni Node with the generated chain spec. You'll start it in development mode (without a relay chain config), producing and finalizing blocks:

    ```bash
    polkadot-omni-node --chain ./chain_spec.json --dev
    ```

    The `--dev` option does the following:

    - Deletes all active data (keys, blockchain database, networking information) when stopped.
    - Ensures a clean working state each time you restart the node.

3. Verify that your node is running by reviewing the terminal output. You should see log messages indicating block production and finalization.

4. Confirm that your blockchain is producing new blocks by checking if the number after `finalized` is increasing in the output.

The details of the log output will be explored in a later tutorial. For now, knowing that your node is running and producing blocks is sufficient.

## Interact with the Node

When running the template node, it's accessible by default at `ws://localhost:9944`. To interact with your node using the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} interface, follow these steps:

1. Open [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} in your web browser and click the network icon (which should be the Polkadot logo) in the top left corner:
    
    ![](/images/parachains/launch-a-parachain/set-up-the-parachain-template/parachain-template-01.webp)

2. Connect to your local node:

    1. Scroll to the bottom and select **Development**.
    2. Choose **Custom**.
    3. Enter `ws://localhost:9944` in the **custom endpoint** input field.
    4. Click the **Switch** button.
    
    ![](/images/parachains/launch-a-parachain/set-up-the-parachain-template/parachain-template-02.webp)

3. Once connected, you should see **parachain-template-runtime** in the top left corner, with the interface displaying information about your local blockchain.
    
    ![](/images/parachains/launch-a-parachain/set-up-the-parachain-template/parachain-template-03.webp)

You are now connected to your local node and can interact with it through the Polkadot.js Apps interface. This tool enables you to explore blocks, execute transactions, and interact with your blockchain's features. For in-depth guidance on using the interface effectively, refer to the [Polkadot.js Guides](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/polkadotjs/){target=\_blank} available on the Polkadot Wiki.

## Stop the Node

When you're done exploring your local node, you can stop it to remove any state changes you've made. Since you started the node with the `--dev` option, stopping the node will purge all persistent block data, allowing you to start fresh the next time.

To stop the local node:

# Sidecar API

## Introduction

The [Sidecar REST API](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar){target=\_blank} is a service that provides a REST interface for interacting with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. With this API, developers can easily access a broad range of endpoints for nodes, accounts, transactions, parachains, and more.

Sidecar functions as a caching layer between your application and a Polkadot SDK-based node, offering standardized REST endpoints that simplify interactions without requiring complex, direct RPC calls. This approach is especially valuable for developers who prefer REST APIs or build applications in languages with limited WebSocket support.

Some of the key features of the Sidecar API include:

- **REST API interface**: Provides a familiar REST API interface for interacting with Polkadot SDK-based chains.
- **Standardized endpoints**: Offers consistent endpoint formats across different chain implementations.
- **Caching layer**: Acts as a caching layer to improve performance and reduce direct node requests.
- **Multiple chain support**: Works with any Polkadot SDK-based chain, including Polkadot, Kusama, and custom chains.

## Prerequisites

Sidecar API requires Node.js version 18.14 LTS or higher. Verify your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

If you need to install or update Node.js, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/){target=\_blank} to download and install the latest LTS version.

## Installation

To install Substrate API Sidecar, use one of the following commands:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install -g @substrate/api-sidecar
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install -g @substrate/api-sidecar
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn global add @substrate/api-sidecar
    ```

You can confirm the installation by running:

```bash
substrate-api-sidecar --version
```

For more information about the Sidecar API installation, see the [installation and usage](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar?tab=readme-ov-file#npm-package-installation-and-usage){target=\_blank} section of the Sidecar API README.

## Usage

To use the Sidecar API, you have two options:

- **Local node**: Run a node locally, which Sidecar will connect to by default, requiring no additional configuration. To start, run the following:

    ```bash
    substrate-api-sidecar
    ```

- **Remote node**: Connect Sidecar to a remote node by specifying the RPC endpoint for that chain. For example, to gain access to the Polkadot Asset Hub associated endpoints.

    ```bash
    SAS_SUBSTRATE_URL=wss://polkadot-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io substrate-api-sidecar
    ```

    For more configuration details, see the [Configuration](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration){target=\_blank} section of the Sidecar API documentation.

Once the Sidecar API is running, you’ll see output similar to this:

</div>
With Sidecar running, you can access the exposed endpoints via a browser, [`Postman`](https://www.postman.com/){target=\_blank}, [`curl`](https://curl.se/){target=\_blank}, or your preferred tool.

### Endpoints

Sidecar API provides a set of REST endpoints that allow you to query different aspects of the chain, including blocks, accounts, and transactions. Each endpoint offers specific insights into the chain’s state and activities.

For example, to retrieve the version of the node, use the `/node/version` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8080/node/version' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

Alternatively, you can access `http://127.0.0.1:8080/node/version` directly in a browser since it’s a `GET` request.

In response, you’ll see output similar to this (assuming you’re connected to Polkadot Asset Hub):

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>curl -X 'GET' 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/node/version' -H 'accept: application/json'</span>
    <br>
    <span data-ty>{</span>
    <span data-ty>    "clientVersion": "1.16.1-835e0767fe8",</span>
    <span data-ty>    "clientImplName": "statemint",</span>
    <span data-ty>    "chain": "Polkadot Asset Hub"</span>
    <span data-ty>}</span>
</div>

# Smart Contracts on Polkadot Hub

## Introduction

Polkadot Hub provides a production-ready smart contract platform that combines Ethereum compatibility with the performance and cross-chain capabilities of the Polkadot ecosystem. Developers can deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot Hub while using familiar Ethereum tooling, workflows, and programming languages.

Built with a dual-VM approach, Polkadot Hub offers two execution backends: REVM for unmodified EVM compatibility and native PolkaVM for optimized computationally expensive workloads. This dual-VM architecture enables developers to migrate existing Ethereum contracts instantly or optimize for speed and efficiency with native execution.

## Why Build on Polkadot Hub

### Ethereum Compatibility

Deploy existing Ethereum contracts with zero modifications while maintaining full compatibility with your existing development stack:

- **Complete JSON-RPC API support**: Use MetaMask, Hardhat, Remix, Foundry, and all standard Ethereum tooling.
- **Standard libraries**: Integrate Ethers.js, Web3.js, Viem, Wagmi, and Web3.py without changes.
- **Solidity development**: Write contracts in Solidity or migrate existing code directly.
- **Familiar workflows**: Maintain your existing deployment, testing, and monitoring processes.

### Performance Options

Choose between two execution backends:

- **REVM**: Run unmodified Ethereum contracts with full EVM/Ethereum compatibility.
- **PolkaVM**: Compile to optimized RISC-V bytecode for enhanced performance and lower fees while keeping Ethereum-compatibility.

Both backends share the same RPC interface and tooling support, allowing seamless transitions. In addition, smart contracts can interact with Polkadot native services via [precompile contracts](/smart-contracts/precompiles/){target=\_blank}.

### Cross-VM  & Cross-Chain Capabilities

Smart contracts written for one VM (for example, EVM) can interact directly with other smart contracts written for the RISC-V PolkaVM, and back. This allows to use full EVM compatible contracts but extend to heavy/complex execution workloads to the PolkaVM RISC-V backend.

Furthermore, all smart contracts in Polkadot Hub can interact with any service in the Polkadot ecosystem through [XCM](/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm/){target=\_blank}, enabling token transfers, remote execution, and cross-chain composability without bridges or intermediaries.

## Other Smart Contract Environments

Beyond Polkadot Hub's native PolkaVM support, the ecosystem offers two main alternatives for smart contract development:

- **EVM-compatible parachains**: Provide access to Ethereum's extensive developer ecosystem, smart contract portability, and established tooling like Hardhat, Remix, Foundry, and OpenZeppelin. The main options include Moonbeam (the first full Ethereum-compatible parachain serving as an interoperability hub), Astar (featuring dual VM support for both EVM and WebAssembly contracts), and Acala (DeFi-focused with enhanced Acala EVM+ offering advanced DeFi primitives).

- **Rust (ink!)**: ink! is a Rust-based framework that can compile to PolkaVM. It uses [`#[ink(...)]`](https://use.ink/docs/v6/macros-attributes/){target=\_blank} attribute macros to create Polkadot SDK-compatible PolkaVM bytecode, offering strong memory safety from Rust, an advanced type system, high-performance PolkaVM execution, and platform independence with sandboxed security.

Page Title: Subxt Rust API

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/reference-tools-subxt.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/tools/subxt/
- Summary: Subxt is a Rust library for type-safe interaction with Polkadot SDK blockchains, enabling transactions, state queries, runtime API access, and more.

# Subxt Rust API

## Introduction

Subxt is a Rust library designed to interact with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. It provides a type-safe interface for submitting transactions, querying on-chain state, and performing other blockchain interactions. By leveraging Rust's strong type system, subxt ensures that your code is validated at compile time, reducing runtime errors and improving reliability.

## Prerequisites

Before using subxt, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install them using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/){target=\_blank}.
- A Rust project initialized. If you don't have one, create it with:
    ```bash
    cargo new my_project && cd my_project
    ```

## Installation

To use subxt in your project, you must install the necessary dependencies. Each plays a specific role in enabling interaction with the blockchain:

1. **Install the subxt CLI**: [`subxt-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/subxt-cli){target=\_blank} is a command-line tool that provides utilities for working with Polkadot SDK metadata. In the context of subxt, it is essential to download chain metadata, which is required to generate type-safe Rust interfaces for interacting with the blockchain. Install it using the following:

    ```bash
    cargo install subxt-cli@0.44.0
    ```

2. **Add core dependencies**: These dependencies are essential for interacting with the blockchain.

    - **[subxt](https://crates.io/crates/subxt){target=\_blank}**: The main library for communicating with Polkadot SDK nodes. It handles RPC requests, encoding/decoding, and type generation.

        ```bash
        cargo add subxt@0.44.0
        ```

    - **[subxt-signer](https://crates.io/crates/subxt-signer){target=\_blank}**: Provides cryptographic functionality for signing transactions. Without this, you can only read data but cannot submit transactions.

        ```bash
        cargo add subxt-signer@0.44.0
        ```

    - **[tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio){target=\_blank}**: An asynchronous runtime for Rust. Since blockchain operations are async, Tokio enables the efficient handling of network requests. The `rt` feature enables Tokio's runtime, including the current-thread single-threaded scheduler, which is necessary for async execution. The `macros` feature provides procedural macros like `#[tokio::main]` to simplify runtime setup.

        ```bash
        cargo add tokio@1.44.2 --features rt,macros
        ```

    After adding the dependencies, your `Cargo.toml` should look like this:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my_project"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2021"

    [dependencies]
    subxt = "0.41.0"
    subxt-signer = "0.41.0"
    tokio = { version = "1.44.2", features = ["rt", "macros"] }

    ```

## Get Started

This guide will walk you through the fundamental operations of subxt, from setting up your environment to executing transactions and querying blockchain state.

### Download Chain Metadata

Before interacting with a blockchain, you need to retrieve its metadata. This metadata defines storage structures, extrinsics, and other runtime details. Use the `subxt-cli` tool to download the metadata, replacing `INSERT_NODE_URL` with the URL of the node you want to interact with:

```bash
subxt metadata --url INSERT_NODE_URL > polkadot_metadata.scale
```

### Generate Type-Safe Interfaces

Use the `#[subxt::subxt]` macro to generate a type-safe Rust interface from the downloaded metadata:

```rust
// Generate an interface that we can use from the node's metadata.
#[subxt::subxt(runtime_metadata_path = "./polkadot_metadata.scale")]
pub mod polkadot {}
```

Once subxt interfaces are generated, you can interact with your node in the following ways. You can use the links below to view the related subxt documentation:

- **[Transactions](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/transactions/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Builds and submits transactions, monitors their inclusion in blocks, and retrieves associated events.
- **[Storage](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/storage/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Enables querying of node storage data.
- **[Events](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/events/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Retrieves events emitted from recent blocks.
- **[Constants](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/constants/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Accesses constant values stored in nodes that remain unchanged across a specific runtime version.
- **[Blocks](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/blocks/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Loads recent blocks or subscribes to new/finalized blocks, allowing examination of extrinsics, events, and storage at those blocks.
- **[Runtime APIs](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/runtime_apis/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Makes calls into pallet runtime APIs to fetch data.
- **[Custom values](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/custom_values/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Accesses "custom values" contained within metadata.
- **[Raw RPC calls](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/usage/rpc/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Facilitates raw RPC requests to compatible nodes.

### Initialize the Subxt Client

To interact with a blockchain node using subxt, create an asynchronous main function and initialize the client. Replace `INSERT_NODE_URL` with the URL of your target node:

```rust
use std::str::FromStr;
use subxt::utils::AccountId32;
use subxt::{OnlineClient, PolkadotConfig};
use subxt_signer::{bip39::Mnemonic,sr25519::Keypair};

// Generate an interface that we can use from the node's metadata.
#[subxt::subxt(runtime_metadata_path = "./polkadot_metadata.scale")]
pub mod polkadot {}

#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Define the node URL.
    const NODE_URL: &str = "INSERT_NODE_URL";

    // Initialize the Subxt client to interact with the blockchain.
    let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::from_url(NODE_URL).await?;

    // Your code here...

    Ok(())
}
```

### Read Chain Data

subxt provides multiple ways to access on-chain data:

- **Constants**: Constants are predefined values in the runtime that remain unchanged unless modified by a runtime upgrade.

    For example, to retrieve the existential deposit, use:
    
    ```rust
        // A query to obtain some constant.
        let constant_query = polkadot::constants().balances().existential_deposit();

        // Obtain the value.
        let value = api.constants().at(&constant_query)?;

        println!("Existential deposit: {:?}", value);
    ```

- **State**: State refers to the current chain data, which updates with each block.

    To fetch account information, replace `INSERT_ADDRESS` with the address you want to fetch data from and use:

    ```rust
        // Define the target account address.
        const ADDRESS: &str = "INSERT_ADDRESS";
        let account = AccountId32::from_str(ADDRESS).unwrap();

        // Build a storage query to access account information.
        let storage_query = polkadot::storage().system().account(&account.into());

        // Fetch the latest state for the account.
        let result = api
            .storage()
            .at_latest()
            .await?
            .fetch(&storage_query)
            .await?
            .unwrap();

        println!("Account info: {:?}", result);
    ```

### Submit Transactions

To submit a transaction, you must construct an extrinsic, sign it with your private key, and send it to the blockchain. Replace `INSERT_DEST_ADDRESS` with the recipient's address, `INSERT_AMOUNT` with the amount to transfer, and `INSERT_SECRET_PHRASE` with the sender's mnemonic phrase:

```rust
    // Define the recipient address and transfer amount.
    const DEST_ADDRESS: &str = "INSERT_DEST_ADDRESS";
    const AMOUNT: u128 = INSERT_AMOUNT;

    // Convert the recipient address into an `AccountId32`.
    let dest = AccountId32::from_str(DEST_ADDRESS).unwrap();

    // Build the balance transfer extrinsic.
    let balance_transfer_tx = polkadot::tx()
        .balances()
        .transfer_allow_death(dest.into(), AMOUNT);

    // Load the sender's keypair from a mnemonic phrase.
    const SECRET_PHRASE: &str = "INSERT_SECRET_PHRASE";
    let mnemonic = Mnemonic::parse(SECRET_PHRASE).unwrap();
    let sender_keypair = Keypair::from_phrase(&mnemonic, None).unwrap();

    // Sign and submit the extrinsic, then wait for it to be finalized.
    let events = api
        .tx()
        .sign_and_submit_then_watch_default(&balance_transfer_tx, &sender_keypair)
        .await?
        .wait_for_finalized_success()
        .await?;

    // Check for a successful transfer event.
    if let Some(event) = events.find_first::<polkadot::balances::events::Transfer>()? {
        println!("Balance transfer successful: {:?}", event);
    }
```

# Transactions

## Introduction

Transactions are essential components of blockchain networks, enabling state changes and the execution of key operations. In the Polkadot SDK, transactions, often called extrinsics, come in multiple forms, including signed, unsigned, and inherent transactions.

This guide walks you through the different transaction types and how they're formatted, validated, and processed within the Polkadot ecosystem. You'll also learn how to customize transaction formats and construct transactions for FRAME-based runtimes, ensuring a complete understanding of how transactions are built and executed in Polkadot SDK-based chains.

## What Is a Transaction?

In the Polkadot SDK, transactions represent operations that modify the chain's state, bundled into blocks for execution. The term extrinsic is often used to refer to any data that originates outside the runtime and is included in the chain. While other blockchain systems typically refer to these operations as "transactions," the Polkadot SDK adopts the broader term "extrinsic" to capture the wide variety of data types that can be added to a block.

There are three primary types of transactions (extrinsics) in the Polkadot SDK:

- **Signed transactions**: Signed by the submitting account, often carrying transaction fees.
- **Unsigned transactions**: Submitted without a signature, often requiring custom validation logic.
- **Inherent transactions**: Typically inserted directly into blocks by block authoring nodes, without gossiping between peers.

Each type serves a distinct purpose, and understanding when and how to use each is key to efficiently working with the Polkadot SDK.

### Signed Transactions

Signed transactions require an account's signature and typically involve submitting a request to execute a runtime call. The signature serves as a form of cryptographic proof that the sender has authorized the action, using their private key. These transactions often involve a transaction fee to cover the cost of execution and incentivize block producers.

Signed transactions are the most common type of transaction and are integral to user-driven actions, such as token transfers. For instance, when you transfer tokens from one account to another, the sending account must sign the transaction to authorize the operation.

For example, the [`pallet_balances::Call::transfer_allow_death`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.transfer_allow_death){target=\_blank} extrinsic in the Balances pallet allows you to transfer tokens. Since your account initiates this transaction, your account key is used to sign it. You'll also be responsible for paying the associated transaction fee, with the option to include an additional tip to incentivize faster inclusion in the block.

### Unsigned Transactions

Unsigned transactions do not require a signature or account-specific data from the sender. Unlike signed transactions, they do not come with any form of economic deterrent, such as fees, which makes them susceptible to spam or replay attacks. Custom validation logic must be implemented to mitigate these risks and ensure these transactions are secure.

Unsigned transactions typically involve scenarios where including a fee or signature is unnecessary or counterproductive. However, due to the absence of fees, they require careful validation to protect the network. For example, [`pallet_im_online::Call::heartbeat`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_im_online/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.heartbeat){target=\_blank} extrinsic allows validators to send a heartbeat signal, indicating they are active. Since only validators can make this call, the logic embedded in the transaction ensures that the sender is a validator, making the need for a signature or fee redundant.

Unsigned transactions are more resource-intensive than signed ones because custom validation is required, but they play a crucial role in certain operational scenarios, especially when regular user accounts aren't involved.

### Inherent Transactions

Inherent transactions are a specialized type of unsigned transaction that is used primarily for block authoring. Unlike signed or other unsigned transactions, inherent transactions are added directly by block producers and are not broadcasted to the network or stored in the transaction queue. They don't require signatures or the usual validation steps and are generally used to insert system-critical data directly into blocks.

A key example of an inherent transaction is inserting a timestamp into each block. The [`pallet_timestamp::Call::now`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_timestamp/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.now-1){target=\_blank} extrinsic allows block authors to include the current time in the block they are producing. Since the block producer adds this information, there is no need for transaction validation, like signature verification. The validation in this case is done indirectly by the validators, who check whether the timestamp is within an acceptable range before finalizing the block.

Another example is the [`paras_inherent::Call::enter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/paras_inherent/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.enter){target=\_blank} extrinsic, which enables parachain collator nodes to send validation data to the relay chain. This inherent transaction ensures that the necessary parachain data is included in each block without the overhead of gossiped transactions.

Inherent transactions serve a critical role in block authoring by allowing important operational data to be added directly to the chain without needing the validation processes required for standard transactions.

## Transaction Formats

Understanding the structure of signed and unsigned transactions is crucial for developers building on Polkadot SDK-based chains. Whether you're optimizing transaction processing, customizing formats, or interacting with the transaction pool, knowing the format of extrinsics, Polkadot's term for transactions, is essential.

### Types of Transaction Formats

In Polkadot SDK-based chains, extrinsics can fall into three main categories:

- **Unchecked extrinsics**: Typically used for signed transactions that require validation. They contain a signature and additional data, such as a nonce and information for fee calculation. Unchecked extrinsics are named as such because they require validation checks before being accepted into the transaction pool.
- **Checked extrinsics**: Typically used for inherent extrinsics (unsigned transactions); these don't require signature verification. Instead, they carry information such as where the extrinsic originates and any additional data required for the block authoring process.
- **Opaque extrinsics**: Used when the format of an extrinsic is not yet fully committed or finalized. They are still decodable, but their structure can be flexible depending on the context.

### Signed Transaction Data Structure

A signed transaction typically includes the following components:

- **Signature**: Verifies the authenticity of the transaction sender.
- **Call**: The actual function or method call the transaction is requesting (for example, transferring funds).
- **Nonce**: Tracks the number of prior transactions sent from the account, helping to prevent replay attacks.
- **Tip**: An optional incentive to prioritize the transaction in block inclusion.
- **Additional data**: Includes details such as spec version, block hash, and genesis hash to ensure the transaction is valid within the correct runtime and chain context.

Here's a simplified breakdown of how signed transactions are typically constructed in a Polkadot SDK runtime:

``` code
<signing account ID> + <signature> + <additional data>
```

Each part of the signed transaction has a purpose, ensuring the transaction's authenticity and context within the blockchain.

### Signed Extensions

Polkadot SDK also provides the concept of [signed extensions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/signed_extensions/index.html){target=\_blank}, which allow developers to extend extrinsics with additional data or validation logic before they are included in a block. The [`SignedExtension`](https://paritytech.github.io/try-runtime-cli/sp_runtime/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html){target=\_blank} set helps enforce custom rules or protections, such as ensuring the transaction's validity or calculating priority.

The transaction queue regularly calls signed extensions to verify a transaction's validity before placing it in the ready queue. This safeguard ensures transactions won't fail in a block. Signed extensions are commonly used to enforce validation logic and protect the transaction pool from spam and replay attacks.

In FRAME, a signed extension can hold any of the following types by default:

- **[`AccountId`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/runtime/types_common/type.AccountId.html){target=\_blank}**: To encode the sender's identity.
- **[`Call`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html#associatedtype.Call){target=\_blank}**: To encode the pallet call to be dispatched. This data is used to calculate transaction fees.
- **[`AdditionalSigned`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html#associatedtype.AdditionalSigned){target=\_blank}**: To handle any additional data to go into the signed payload allowing you to attach any custom logic prior to dispatching a transaction.
- **[`Pre`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html#associatedtype.Pre){target=\_blank}**: To encode the information that can be passed from before a call is dispatched to after it gets dispatched.

Signed extensions can enforce checks like:

- **[`CheckSpecVersion`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/src/frame_system/extensions/check_spec_version.rs.html){target=\_blank}**: Ensures the transaction is compatible with the runtime's current version.
- **[`CheckWeight`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/struct.CheckWeight.html){target=\_blank}**: Calculates the weight (or computational cost) of the transaction, ensuring the block doesn't exceed the maximum allowed weight.

These extensions are critical in the transaction lifecycle, ensuring that only valid and prioritized transactions are processed.

## Transaction Construction

Building transactions in the Polkadot SDK involves constructing a payload that can be verified, signed, and submitted for inclusion in a block. Each runtime in the Polkadot SDK has its own rules for validating and executing transactions, but there are common patterns for constructing a signed transaction.

### Construct a Signed Transaction

A signed transaction in the Polkadot SDK includes various pieces of data to ensure security, prevent replay attacks, and prioritize processing. Here's an overview of how to construct one:

1. **Construct the unsigned payload**: Gather the necessary information for the call, including:

    - **Pallet index**: Identifies the pallet where the runtime function resides.
    - **Function index**: Specifies the particular function to call in the pallet.
    - **Parameters**: Any additional arguments required by the function call.

2. **Create a signing payload**: Once the unsigned payload is ready, additional data must be included:

    - **Transaction nonce**: Unique identifier to prevent replay attacks.
    - **Era information**: Defines how long the transaction is valid before it's dropped from the pool.
    - **Block hash**: Ensures the transaction doesn't execute on the wrong chain or fork.

3. **Sign the payload**: Using the sender's private key, sign the payload to ensure that the transaction can only be executed by the account holder.
4. **Serialize the signed payload**: Once signed, the transaction must be serialized into a binary format, ensuring the data is compact and easy to transmit over the network.
5. **Submit the serialized transaction**: Finally, submit the serialized transaction to the network, where it will enter the transaction pool and wait for processing by an authoring node.

The following is an example of how a signed transaction might look:

``` rust
node_runtime::UncheckedExtrinsic::new_signed(
    function.clone(),                                      // some call
    sp_runtime::AccountId32::from(sender.public()).into(), // some sending account
    node_runtime::Signature::Sr25519(signature.clone()),   // the account's signature
    extra.clone(),                                         // the signed extensions
)
```

### Transaction Encoding

Before a transaction is sent to the network, it is serialized and encoded using a structured encoding process that ensures consistency and prevents tampering:

- **`[1]`**: Compact encoded length in bytes of the entire transaction.
- **`[2]`**: A u8 containing 1 byte to indicate whether the transaction is signed or unsigned (1 bit) and the encoded transaction version ID (7 bits).
- **`[3]`**: If signed, this field contains an account ID, an SR25519 signature, and some extra data.
- **`[4]`**: Encoded call data, including pallet and function indices and any required arguments.

This encoded format ensures consistency and efficiency in processing transactions across the network. By adhering to this format, applications can construct valid transactions and pass them to the network for execution.

To learn more about how compact encoding works using SCALE, see the [SCALE Codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} README on GitHub.

### Customize Transaction Construction

Although the basic steps for constructing transactions are consistent across Polkadot SDK-based chains, developers can customize transaction formats and validation rules. For example:

- **Custom pallets**: You can define new pallets with custom function calls, each with its own parameters and validation logic.
- **Signed extensions**: Developers can implement custom extensions that modify how transactions are prioritized, validated, or included in blocks.

By leveraging Polkadot SDK's modular design, developers can create highly specialized transaction logic tailored to their chain's needs.

## Lifecycle of a Transaction

In the Polkadot SDK, transactions are often referred to as extrinsics because the data in transactions originates outside of the runtime. These transactions contain data that initiates changes to the chain state. The most common type of extrinsic is a signed transaction, which is cryptographically verified and typically incurs a fee. This section focuses on how signed transactions are processed, validated, and ultimately included in a block.

### Define Transaction Properties

The Polkadot SDK runtime defines key transaction properties, such as:

- **Transaction validity**: Ensures the transaction meets all runtime requirements.
- **Signed or unsigned**: Identifies whether a transaction needs to be signed by an account.
- **State changes**: Determines how the transaction modifies the state of the chain.

Pallets, which compose the runtime's logic, define the specific transactions that your chain supports. When a user submits a transaction, such as a token transfer, it becomes a signed transaction, verified by the user's account signature. If the account has enough funds to cover fees, the transaction is executed, and the chain's state is updated accordingly.

### Process on a Block Authoring Node

In Polkadot SDK-based networks, some nodes are authorized to author blocks. These nodes validate and process transactions. When a transaction is sent to a node that can produce blocks, it undergoes a lifecycle that involves several stages, including validation and execution. Non-authoring nodes gossip the transaction across the network until an authoring node receives it. The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a transaction that's submitted to a network and processed by an authoring node.

![Transaction lifecycle diagram](/images/reference/parachains/blocks-transactions-fees/transactions/transactions-01.webp){ style="background:white" }

### Validate and Queue

Once a transaction reaches an authoring node, it undergoes an initial validation process to ensure it meets specific conditions defined in the runtime. This validation includes checks for:

- **Correct nonce**: Ensures the transaction is sequentially valid for the account.
- **Sufficient funds**: Confirms the account can cover any associated transaction fees.
- **Signature validity**: Verifies that the sender's signature matches the transaction data.

After these checks, valid transactions are placed in the transaction pool, where they are queued for inclusion in a block. The transaction pool regularly re-validates queued transactions to ensure they remain valid before being processed. To reach consensus, two-thirds of the nodes must agree on the order of the transactions executed and the resulting state change. Transactions are validated and queued on the local node in a transaction pool to prepare for consensus.

#### Transaction Pool

The transaction pool is responsible for managing valid transactions. It ensures that only transactions that pass initial validity checks are queued. Transactions that fail validation, expire, or become invalid for other reasons are removed from the pool.

The transaction pool organizes transactions into two queues:

- **Ready queue**: Transactions that are valid and ready to be included in a block.
- **Future queue**: Transactions that are not yet valid but could be in the future, such as transactions with a nonce too high for the current state.

Details on how the transaction pool validates transactions, including fee and signature handling, can be found in the [`validate_transaction`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_transaction_pool/runtime_api/trait.TaggedTransactionQueue.html#method.validate_transaction){target=\_blank} method.

#### Invalid Transactions

If a transaction is invalid, for example, due to an invalid signature or insufficient funds, it is rejected and won't be added to the block. Invalid transactions might be rejected for reasons such as:

- The transaction has already been included in a block.
- The transaction's signature does not match the sender.
- The transaction is too large to fit in the current block.

### Transaction Ordering and Priority

When a node is selected as the next block author, it prioritizes transactions based on weight, length, and tip amount. The goal is to fill the block with high-priority transactions without exceeding its maximum size or computational limits. Transactions are ordered as follows:

- **Inherents first**: Inherent transactions, such as block timestamp updates, are always placed first.
- **Nonce-based ordering**: Transactions from the same account are ordered by their nonce.
- **Fee-based ordering**: Among transactions with the same nonce or priority level, those with higher fees are prioritized.

### Transaction Execution

Once a block author selects transactions from the pool, the transactions are executed in priority order. As each transaction is processed, the state changes are written directly to the chain's storage. It's important to note that these changes are not cached, meaning a failed transaction won't revert earlier state changes, which could leave the block in an inconsistent state.

Events are also written to storage. Runtime logic should not emit an event before performing the associated actions. If the associated transaction fails after the event was emitted, the event will not revert.

## Transaction Mortality

Transactions in the network can be configured as either mortal (with expiration) or immortal (without expiration). Every transaction payload contains a block checkpoint (reference block number and hash) and an era/validity period that determines how many blocks after the checkpoint the transaction remains valid.

When a transaction is submitted, the network validates it against these parameters. If the transaction is not included in a block within the specified validity window, it is automatically removed from the transaction queue.

- **Mortal transactions**: Have a finite lifespan and will expire after a specified number of blocks. For example, a transaction with a block checkpoint of 1000 and a validity period of 64 blocks will be valid from blocks 1000 to 1064.

- **Immortal transactions**: Never expire and remain valid indefinitely. To create an immortal transaction, set the block checkpoint to 0 (genesis block), use the genesis hash as a reference, and set the validity period to 0.

However, immortal transactions pose significant security risks through replay attacks. If an account is reaped (balance drops to zero, account removed) and later re-funded, malicious actors can replay old immortal transactions.

The blockchain maintains only a limited number of prior block hashes for reference validation, called `BlockHashCount`. If your validity period exceeds `BlockHashCount`, the effective validity period becomes the minimum of your specified period and the block hash count.

## Unique Identifiers for Extrinsics

Transaction hashes are **not unique identifiers** in Polkadot SDK-based chains.

Key differences from traditional blockchains:

- Transaction hashes serve only as fingerprints of transaction information.
- Multiple valid transactions can share the same hash.
- Hash uniqueness assumptions lead to serious issues.

For example, when an account is reaped (removed due to insufficient balance) and later recreated, it resets to nonce 0, allowing identical transactions to be valid at different points:

| Block | Extrinsic Index | Hash | Origin    | Nonce | Call                | Result                        |
|-------|----------------|------|-----------|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 100   | 0              | 0x01 | Account A | 0     | Transfer 5 DOT to B | Account A reaped              |
| 150   | 5              | 0x02 | Account B | 4     | Transfer 7 DOT to A | Account A created (nonce = 0) |
| 200   | 2              | 0x01 | Account A | 0     | Transfer 5 DOT to B | Successful transaction        |

Notice that blocks 100 and 200 contain transactions with identical hashes (0x01) but are completely different, valid operations occurring at different times.

Additional complexity comes from Polkadot SDK's origin abstraction. Origins can represent collectives, governance bodies, or other non-account entities that don't maintain nonces like regular accounts and might dispatch identical calls multiple times with the same hash values. Each execution occurs in different chain states with different results.

The correct way to uniquely identify an extrinsic on a Polkadot SDK-based chain is to use the block ID (height or hash) and the extrinsic index. Since the Polkadot SDK defines blocks as headers plus ordered arrays of extrinsics, the index position within a canonical block provides guaranteed uniqueness.

# Blocks, Transactions, and Fees

## Introduction

Asset Hub smart contracts operate within the Polkadot ecosystem using the [`pallet_revive`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/){target=\_blank} implementation, which provides EVM compatibility. While many aspects of blocks and transactions are inherited from the underlying parachain architecture, there are specific considerations and mechanisms unique to smart contract operations on Asset Hub.

## Smart Contract Blocks

Smart contract blocks in Asset Hub follow the same fundamental structure as parachain blocks, inheriting all standard parachain block components. The `pallet_revive` implementation maintains this consistency while adding necessary [EVM-specific features](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm){target=\_blank}. For detailed implementation specifics, the [`Block`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Block.html){target=\_blank} struct in `pallet_revive` demonstrates how parachain and smart contract block implementations align.

## Smart Contract Transactions

Asset Hub implements a sophisticated transaction system that supports various transaction types and formats, encompassing both traditional parachain operations and EVM-specific interactions.

### EVM Transaction Types

The system provides a fundamental [`eth_transact`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/dispatchables/fn.eth_transact.html){target=\_blank} interface for processing raw EVM transactions dispatched through [Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs](/smart-contracts/for-eth-devs/json-rpc-apis/){target=\_blank}. This interface acts as a wrapper for Ethereum transactions, requiring an encoded signed transaction payload, though it cannot be dispatched directly. Building upon this foundation, the system supports multiple transaction formats to accommodate different use cases and optimization needs:

- **[Legacy transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.TransactionLegacyUnsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: The original Ethereum transaction format, providing basic transfer and contract interaction capabilities. These transactions use a simple pricing mechanism and are supported for backward compatibility.

- **[EIP-1559 transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Transaction1559Unsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: An improved transaction format that introduces a more predictable fee mechanism with base fee and priority fee components. This format helps optimize gas fee estimation and network congestion management.

- **[EIP-2930 transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Transaction2930Unsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: Introduces access lists to optimize gas costs for contract interactions by pre-declaring accessed addresses and storage slots.

- **[EIP-4844 transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Transaction4844Unsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: Implements blob-carrying transactions, designed to optimize Layer 2 scaling solutions by providing dedicated space for roll-up data.

Each transaction type can exist in both signed and unsigned states, with appropriate validation and processing mechanisms for each.

## Fees and Gas

Asset Hub implements a sophisticated resource management system that combines parachain transaction fees with EVM gas mechanics, providing both Ethereum compatibility and enhanced features.

### Gas Model Overview

Gas serves as the fundamental unit for measuring computational costs, with each network operation consuming a specified amount. This implementation maintains compatibility with Ethereum's approach while adding parachain-specific optimizations.

- **Dynamic gas scaling**: Asset Hub implements a dynamic pricing mechanism that reflects actual execution performance. This results in:

    - More efficient pricing for computational instructions relative to I/O operations.
    - Better correlation between gas costs and actual resource consumption.
    - Need for developers to implement flexible gas calculation rather than hardcoding values.

- **Multi-dimensional resource metering**: Asset Hub extends beyond the traditional single-metric gas model to track three distinct resources.

    - `ref_time` (computation time):

        - Functions as traditional gas equivalent.
        - Measures actual computational resource usage.
        - Primary metric for basic operation costs.


    - `proof_size` (verification overhead):

        - Tracks state proof size required for validator verification.
        - Helps manage consensus-related resource consumption.
        - Important for cross-chain operations.


    - `storage_deposit` (state management):

        - Manages blockchain state growth.
        - Implements a deposit-based system for long-term storage.
        - Refundable when storage is freed.

These resources can be limited at both transaction and contract levels, similar to Ethereum's gas limits. For more information, check the [Gas Model](/smart-contracts/for-eth-devs/gas-model/){target=\_blank} documentation.

### Fee Components

- Base fees:

    - Storage deposit for contract deployment.
    - Minimum transaction fee for network access.
    - Network maintenance costs.

- Execution fees:

    - Computed based on gas consumption.
    - Converted to native currency using network-defined rates.
    - Reflects actual computational resource usage.

- Storage fees:

    - Deposit for long-term storage usage.
    - Refundable when storage is freed.
    - Helps prevent state bloat.

### Gas Calculation and Conversion

The system maintains precise conversion mechanisms between:

- Substrate weights and EVM gas units.
- Native currency and gas costs.
- Different resource metrics within the multi-dimensional model.

This ensures accurate fee calculation while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and workflows.

# Transactions Weights and Fees

## Introductions

When transactions are executed, or data is stored on-chain, the activity changes the chain's state and consumes blockchain resources. Because the resources available to a blockchain are limited, managing how operations on-chain consume them is important. In addition to being limited in practical terms, such as storage capacity, blockchain resources represent a potential attack vector for malicious users. For example, a malicious user might attempt to overload the network with messages to stop the network from producing new blocks. To protect blockchain resources from being drained or overloaded, you need to manage how they are made available and how they are consumed. The resources to be aware of include:

- Memory usage
- Storage input and output
- Computation
- Transaction and block size
- State database size

The Polkadot SDK provides block authors with several ways to manage access to resources and to prevent individual components of the chain from consuming too much of any single resource. Two of the most important mechanisms available to block authors are weights and transaction fees.

[Weights](/reference/glossary/#weight){target=\_blank} manage the time it takes to validate a block and characterize the time it takes to execute the calls in the block's body. By controlling the execution time a block can consume, weights set limits on storage input, output, and computation.

Some of the weight allowed for a block is consumed as part of the block's initialization and finalization. The weight might also be used to execute mandatory inherent extrinsic calls. To help ensure blocks don’t consume too much execution time and prevent malicious users from overloading the system with unnecessary calls, weights are combined with transaction fees.

[Transaction fees](/reference/parachains/blocks-transactions-fees/transactions/#transaction-fees){target=\_blank} provide an economic incentive to limit execution time, computation, and the number of calls required to perform operations. Transaction fees are also used to make the blockchain economically sustainable because they are typically applied to transactions initiated by users and deducted before a transaction request is executed.

## How Fees are Calculated

The final fee for a transaction is calculated using the following parameters:

- **`base fee`**: This is the minimum amount a user pays for a transaction. It is declared a base weight in the runtime and converted to a fee using the [`WeightToFee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.WeightToFee){target=\_blank} conversion.
- **`weight fee`**: A fee proportional to the execution time (input and output and computation) that a transaction consumes.
- **`length fee`**: A fee proportional to the encoded length of the transaction.
- **`tip`**: An optional tip to increase the transaction’s priority, giving it a higher chance to be included in the transaction queue.

The base fee and proportional weight and length fees constitute the inclusion fee. The inclusion fee is the minimum fee that must be available for a transaction to be included in a block.

```text
inclusion fee = base fee + weight fee + length fee
```

Transaction fees are withdrawn before the transaction is executed. After the transaction is executed, the weight can be adjusted to reflect the resources used. If a transaction uses fewer resources than expected, the transaction fee is corrected, and the adjusted transaction fee is deposited.

## Using the Transaction Payment Pallet

The [Transaction Payment pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/polkadot-stable2506-2/substrate/frame/transaction-payment){target=\_blank} provides the basic logic for calculating the inclusion fee. You can also use the Transaction Payment pallet to:

- Convert a weight value into a deductible fee based on a currency type using [`Config::WeightToFee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.WeightToFee){target=\_blank}.
- Update the fee for the next block by defining a multiplier based on the chain’s final state at the end of the previous block using [`Config::FeeMultiplierUpdate`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.FeeMultiplierUpdate){target=\_blank}.
- Manage the withdrawal, refund, and deposit of transaction fees using [`Config::OnChargeTransaction`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.OnChargeTransaction){target=\_blank}.

You can learn more about these configuration traits in the [Transaction Payment documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_transaction_payment/index.html){target=\_blank}.

### Understanding the Inclusion Fee

The formula for calculating the inclusion fee is as follows:

```text
inclusion_fee = base_fee + length_fee + [targeted_fee_adjustment * weight_fee]
```

And then, for calculating the final fee:

```text
final_fee = inclusion_fee + tip
```

In the first formula, the `targeted_fee_adjustment` is a multiplier that can tune the final fee based on the network’s congestion.

- The `base_fee` derived from the base weight covers inclusion overhead like signature verification.
- The `length_fee` is a per-byte fee that is multiplied by the length of the encoded extrinsic.
- The `weight_fee` fee is calculated using two parameters:
  - The `ExtrinsicBaseWeight` that is declared in the runtime and applies to all extrinsics.
  - The `#[pallet::weight]` annotation that accounts for an extrinsic's complexity.

To convert the weight to `Currency`, the runtime must define a `WeightToFee` struct that implements a conversion function, [`Convert<Weight,Balance>`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.weight_to_fee){target=\_blank}.

Note that the extrinsic sender is charged the inclusion fee before the extrinsic is invoked. The fee is deducted from the sender's balance even if the transaction fails upon execution.

### Accounts with an Insufficient Balance

If an account does not have a sufficient balance to pay the inclusion fee and remain alive—that is, enough to pay the inclusion fee and maintain the minimum existential deposit—then you should ensure the transaction is canceled so that no fee is deducted and the transaction does not begin execution.

The Polkadot SDK doesn't enforce this rollback behavior. However, this scenario would be rare because the transaction queue and block-making logic perform checks to prevent it before adding an extrinsic to a block.

### Fee Multipliers

The inclusion fee formula always results in the same fee for the same input. However, weight can be dynamic and—based on how [`WeightToFee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.WeightToFee){target=\_blank} is defined—the final fee can include some degree of variability.
The Transaction Payment pallet provides the [`FeeMultiplierUpdate`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.FeeMultiplierUpdate){target=\_blank} configurable parameter to account for this variability.

The Polkadot network inspires the default update function and implements a targeted adjustment in which a target saturation level of block weight is defined. If the previous block is more saturated, the fees increase slightly. Similarly, if the last block has fewer transactions than the target, fees are decreased by a small amount. For more information about fee multiplier adjustments, see the [Web3 Research Page](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/overview/token-economics#relay-chain-transaction-fees-and-per-block-transaction-limits){target=\_blank}.

## Transactions with Special Requirements

Inclusion fees must be computable before execution and can only represent fixed logic. Some transactions warrant limiting resources with other strategies. For example:

- Bonds are a type of fee that might be returned or slashed after some on-chain event. For example, you might want to require users to place a bond to participate in a vote. The bond might then be returned at the end of the referendum or slashed if the voter attempted malicious behavior.
- Deposits are fees that might be returned later. For example, you might require users to pay a deposit to execute an operation that uses storage. The user’s deposit could be returned if a subsequent operation frees up storage.
- Burn operations are used to pay for a transaction based on its internal logic. For example, a transaction might burn funds from the sender if the transaction creates new storage items to pay for the increased state size.
- Limits enable you to enforce constant or configurable limits on specific operations. For example, the default [Staking pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/polkadot-stable2506-2/substrate/frame/staking){target=\_blank} only allows nominators to nominate 16 validators to limit the complexity of the validator election process.

It is important to note that if you query the chain for a transaction fee, it only returns the inclusion fee.

## Default Weight Annotations

All dispatchable functions in the Polkadot SDK must specify a weight. The way of doing that is using the annotation-based system that lets you combine fixed values for database read/write weight and/or fixed values based on benchmarks. The most basic example would look like this:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(100_000)]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

Note that the [`ExtrinsicBaseWeight`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/constants/struct.ExtrinsicBaseWeight.html){target=\_blank} is automatically added to the declared weight to account for the costs of simply including an empty extrinsic into a block.

### Weights and Database Read/Write Operations

To make weight annotations independent of the deployed database backend, they are defined as a constant and then used in the annotations when expressing database accesses performed by the dispatchable:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(T::DbWeight::get().reads_writes(1, 2) + 20_000)]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

This dispatchable allows one database to read and two to write, in addition to other things that add the additional 20,000. Database access is generally every time a value declared inside the [`#[pallet::storage]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.storage.html){target=\_blank} block is accessed. However, unique accesses are counted because after a value is accessed, it is cached, and reaccessing it does not result in a database operation. That is:

- Multiple reads of the exact value count as one read.
- Multiple writes of the exact value count as one write.
- Multiple reads of the same value, followed by a write to that value, count as one read and one write.
- A write followed by a read-only counts as one write.

### Dispatch Classes

Dispatches are broken into three classes:

- Normal
- Operational
- Mandatory

If a dispatch is not defined as `Operational` or `Mandatory` in the weight annotation, the dispatch is identified as `Normal` by default. You can specify that the dispatchable uses another class like this:

```rust
#[pallet::dispatch((DispatchClass::Operational))]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

This tuple notation also allows you to specify a final argument determining whether the user is charged based on the annotated weight. If you don't specify otherwise, `Pays::Yes` is assumed:

```rust
#[pallet::dispatch(DispatchClass::Normal, Pays::No)]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

#### Normal Dispatches

Dispatches in this class represent normal user-triggered transactions. These types of dispatches only consume a portion of a block's total weight limit. For information about the maximum portion of a block that can be consumed for normal dispatches, see [`AvailableBlockRatio`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/limits/struct.BlockLength.html){target=\_blank}. Normal dispatches are sent to the transaction pool.

#### Operational Dispatches

Unlike normal dispatches, which represent the usage of network capabilities, operational dispatches are those that provide network capabilities. Operational dispatches can consume the entire weight limit of a block. They are not bound by the [`AvailableBlockRatio`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/limits/struct.BlockLength.html){target=\_blank}. Dispatches in this class are given maximum priority and are exempt from paying the [`length_fee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/){target=\_blank}.

#### Mandatory Dispatches

Mandatory dispatches are included in a block even if they cause the block to surpass its weight limit. You can only use the mandatory dispatch class for inherent transactions that the block author submits. This dispatch class is intended to represent functions in the block validation process. Because these dispatches are always included in a block regardless of the function weight, the validation process must prevent malicious nodes from abusing the function to craft valid but impossibly heavy blocks. You can typically accomplish this by ensuring that:

- The operation performed is always light.
- The operation can only be included in a block once.

To make it more difficult for malicious nodes to abuse mandatory dispatches, they cannot be included in blocks that return errors. This dispatch class serves the assumption that it is better to allow an overweight block to be created than not to allow any block to be created at all.

### Dynamic Weights

In addition to purely fixed weights and constants, the weight calculation can consider the input arguments of a dispatchable. The weight should be trivially computable from the input arguments with some basic arithmetic:

```rust
use frame_support:: {
    dispatch:: {
        DispatchClass::Normal,
        Pays::Yes,
    },
   weights::Weight,
};

#[pallet::weight(FunctionOf(
  |args: (&Vec<User>,)| args.0.len().saturating_mul(10_000),
  )
]
fn handle_users(origin, calls: Vec<User>) {
    // Do something per user
}
```

## Post Dispatch Weight Correction

Depending on the execution logic, a dispatchable function might consume less weight than was prescribed pre-dispatch. To correct weight, the function declares a different return type and returns its actual weight:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(10_000 + 500_000_000)]
fn expensive_or_cheap(input: u64) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let was_heavy = do_calculation(input);

    if (was_heavy) {
        // None means "no correction" from the weight annotation.
        Ok(None.into())
    } else {
        // Return the actual weight consumed.
        Ok(Some(10_000).into())
    }
}
```

## Custom Fees

You can also define custom fee systems through custom weight functions or inclusion fee functions.

### Custom Weights

Instead of using the default weight annotations, you can create a custom weight calculation type using the weights module. The custom weight calculation type must implement the following traits:

- [`WeighData<T>`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/trait.WeighData.html){target=\_blank} to determine the weight of the dispatch.
- [`ClassifyDispatch<T>`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/trait.ClassifyDispatch.html){target=\_blank} to determine the class of the dispatch.
- [`PaysFee<T>`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/trait.PaysFee.html){target=\_blank} to determine whether the sender of the dispatch pays fees.
 
The Polkadot SDK then bundles the output information of the three traits into the [`DispatchInfo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/dispatch/struct.DispatchInfo.html){target=\_blank} struct and provides it by implementing the [`GetDispatchInfo`](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/dispatch/trait.GetDispatchInfo.html){target=\_blank} for all `Call` variants and opaque extrinsic types. This is used internally by the System and Executive modules.

`ClassifyDispatch`, `WeighData`, and `PaysFee` are generic over T, which gets resolved into the tuple of all dispatch arguments except for the origin. The following example illustrates a struct that calculates the weight as `m * len(args)`, where `m` is a given multiplier and args is the concatenated tuple of all dispatch arguments. In this example, the dispatch class is `Operational` if the transaction has more than 100 bytes of length in arguments and will pay fees if the encoded length exceeds 10 bytes.

```rust
struct LenWeight(u32);
impl<T> WeighData<T> for LenWeight {
    fn weigh_data(&self, target: T) -> Weight {
        let multiplier = self.0;
        let encoded_len = target.encode().len() as u32;
        multiplier * encoded_len
    }
}

impl<T> ClassifyDispatch<T> for LenWeight {
    fn classify_dispatch(&self, target: T) -> DispatchClass {
        let encoded_len = target.encode().len() as u32;
        if encoded_len > 100 {
            DispatchClass::Operational
        } else {
            DispatchClass::Normal
        }
    }
}

impl<T> PaysFee<T> {
    fn pays_fee(&self, target: T) -> Pays {
        let encoded_len = target.encode().len() as u32;
        if encoded_len > 10 {
            Pays::Yes
        } else {
            Pays::No
        }
    }
}
```

A weight calculator function can also be coerced to the final type of the argument instead of defining it as a vague type that can be encoded. The code would roughly look like this:

```rust
struct CustomWeight;
impl WeighData<(&u32, &u64)> for CustomWeight {
    fn weigh_data(&self, target: (&u32, &u64)) -> Weight {
        ...
    }
}

// given a dispatch:
#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config<I>, I: 'static> Pallet<T, I> {
    #[pallet::weight(CustomWeight)]
    fn foo(a: u32, b: u64) { ... }
}
```

In this example, the `CustomWeight` can only be used in conjunction with a dispatch with a particular signature `(u32, u64)`, as opposed to `LenWeight`, which can be used with anything because there aren't any assumptions about `<T>`.

#### Custom Inclusion Fee

The following example illustrates how to customize your inclusion fee. You must configure the appropriate associated types in the respective module.

```rust
// Assume this is the balance type
type Balance = u64;

// Assume we want all the weights to have a `100 + 2 * w` conversion to fees
struct CustomWeightToFee;
impl WeightToFee<Weight, Balance> for CustomWeightToFee {
    fn convert(w: Weight) -> Balance {
        let a = Balance::from(100);
        let b = Balance::from(2);
        let w = Balance::from(w);
        a + b * w
    }
}

parameter_types! {
    pub const ExtrinsicBaseWeight: Weight = 10_000_000;
}

impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {
    type ExtrinsicBaseWeight = ExtrinsicBaseWeight;
}

parameter_types! {
    pub const TransactionByteFee: Balance = 10;
}

impl transaction_payment::Config {
    type TransactionByteFee = TransactionByteFee;
    type WeightToFee = CustomWeightToFee;
    type FeeMultiplierUpdate = TargetedFeeAdjustment<TargetBlockFullness>;
}

struct TargetedFeeAdjustment<T>(sp_std::marker::PhantomData<T>);
impl<T: Get<Perquintill>> WeightToFee<Fixed128, Fixed128> for TargetedFeeAdjustment<T> {
    fn convert(multiplier: Fixed128) -> Fixed128 {
        // Don't change anything. Put any fee update info here.
        multiplier
    }
}
```

## Additional Resources

You now know the weight system, how it affects transaction fee computation, and how to specify weights for your dispatchable calls. The next step is determining the correct weight for your dispatchable operations. You can use Substrate benchmarking functions and frame-benchmarking calls to test your functions with different parameters and empirically determine the proper weight in their worst-case scenarios.

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-dev-environments-hardhat.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/dev-environments/hardhat/
- Summary: Learn how to create, compile, test, and deploy smart contracts on Polkadot Hub using Hardhat, a powerful development environment for blockchain developers.

# Hardhat

## Introduction

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank} is a flexible development environment for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Polkadot. Its task runner and plugin system support organizing contract code, running tests, managing deployments, and adding custom tooling. This page demonstrates how to set up a Hardhat project for Polkadot Hub.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Hardhat, make sure the following are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/){target=\_blank} (Hardhat requires an LTS Node version, even major numbers like 18.x, 20.x, or 22.x)
- A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/){target=\_blank}, or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}

## Initialize a Hardhat Project

1. Create a directory to hold your project files:

    ```bash
    mkdir hardhat-example
    cd hardhat-example
    ```

2. Initialize a Hardhat project:

    === "npm"

        This single command sets up your project, installs Hardhat (and optionally the Toolbox), and intializes the project:

        ```bash
        npx hardhat@^2.27.0 init
        ```

    === "pnpm"

        This single command sets up your project, installs Hardhat (and optionally the Toolbox), and intializes the project:

        ```bash
        pnpm dlx hardhat@^2.27.0 init
        ```

    === "yarn"

        These commands manually set up your project, install Hardhat (and optionally the Toolbox), and initializes the project:

        ```bash
        # Initialize a new Node.js project
        yarn init -y

        # Install Hardhat and the Hardhat Toolbox locally
        yarn add --dev hardhat@^2.27.0 @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

        # Initialize a Hardhat project
        npx hardhat init
        ```

3. You will be prompted to select certain configurations for your project. To quickly create a working setup, you can accept the default answers, which will create a JavaScript project, initialize it in the current directory, add a `.gitignore`, and install all dependencies.

After completing the setup, your Hardhat project will be fully initialized with all necessary files and dependencies. You'll see the following core components in your project:

- **`contracts`**: Stores your Solidity smart contracts.
- **`ignition`**: Contains deployment modules for safely deploying your contracts to various networks.
- **`test`**: Contains test files that validate contract functionality.
- **`hardhat.config.js | .ts`**: Defines your project's settings, including networks, compiler options, and plugins.

## Configure Hardhat for Polkadot Hub

To use Hardhat with Polkadot Hub, define the network configuration in your `hardhat.config.ts` file:

=== "Polkadot TestNet"

    ```ts title='hardhat.config.ts'
    import type { HardhatUserConfig } from 'hardhat/config';
    import '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox';

    // If you want to use a variable for your private key
    import { vars } from 'hardhat/config';

    const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
    solidity: '0.8.28',
    networks: {
        polkadotTestnet: {
        url: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
        chainId: 420420422,
        accounts: [vars.get('PRIVATE_KEY')],
        },
    },
    };

    export default config;
    ```

!!! tip

    To define a [configuration variable](https://v2.hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables){target=\_blank} for your private key, run:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat vars set PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

    Hardhat will prompt you to enter your private key and store it so it can be referenced in your configuration file.

# Remix IDE

## Introduction

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank} is a browser-based IDE that makes it easy to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts without installing any local tools. It’s a great place to experiment, learn, and quickly test contracts on Polkadot. This page introduces the main parts of the Remix interface and shows how to connect it to Polkadot so you can deploy and interact with contracts directly from your browser.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- A browser with the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank} extension installed
- MetaMask connected to Polkadot (see the [Wallet Integrations](/smart-contracts/integrations/wallets/#metamask){target=\_blank} guide for setup steps)

## Access Remix IDE

Navigate to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank}. The interface will load with a default workspace containing sample contracts. In this interface, you can access the following:

- **Editor panel**: The main coding area where you write and modify your smart contract files. Supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and linting.
- **Terminal**: Shows logs from the compiler, deployment events, transactions, and console.log output. Useful for debugging and tracking execution.
- **Plugin panel**: Displays icons for each of the preloaded plugins, the plugin manager, and the settings menu. You'll see a few icons there for each of the preloaded plugins:

    - **File explorer**: Displays your project workspace. You can create, open, rename, and organize Solidity files, scripts, and folders.
    - **File search**: A quick search tool for finding symbols, functions, or text within your project files.
    - **Solidity compiler**: A plugin that compiles your Solidity contracts. It allows you to select compiler versions, enable optimizations, and view compilation errors or warnings.
    - **Deploy & run transactions**: Used to deploy contracts and interact with them. Allows you to choose an environment (JavaScript VM, injected provider, or custom RPC), deploy contracts, send transactions, and call read/write functions.
    - **Debugger**: Allows you to step through a transaction execution line-by-line. You can inspect variables, stack values, storage slots, and opcodes to understand exactly how your contract behaved during a specific transaction.
    - **Git**: Enables basic Git version control directly inside Remix. You can initialize repositories, view diffs, commit changes, and browse project history without needing an external Git client.

## Connect Remix to Polkadot

You can connect Remix to Polkadot from the **Deploy & run transactions** tab in the plugin panel:

1. Switch your MetaMask network to Polkadot. For detailed steps on setting up MetaMask for Polkadot, see the [Wallet Integrations](/smart-contracts/integrations/wallets/#metamask){target=\_blank} guide.
2. Click on the **Environment** dropdown.
3. Hover over **browser extension**.
4. Select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**.

![](/images/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix/remix-02.webp)

Once connected, Remix will display your MetaMask account address under **Accounts**. To switch accounts, change it in MetaMask—Remix updates automatically.

Page Title: viem for Polkadot Hub Smart Contracts

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-libraries-viem.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/libraries/viem/
- Summary: This guide covers deploying and interacting with contracts on Polkadot Hub using viem, a TypeScript library for Ethereum-compatible chains.

# viem

## Introduction

[viem](https://viem.sh/){target=\_blank} is a lightweight TypeScript library designed for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains. This comprehensive guide will walk you through using viem to interact with and deploy smart contracts to Polkadot Hub.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.13.1 or later, check the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/){target=\_blank}.
- **npm**: v6.13.4 or later (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **Solidity**: This guide uses Solidity `^0.8.9` for smart contract development.

## Project Structure

This project organizes contracts, scripts, and compiled artifacts for easy development and deployment.

```text
viem-project/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── src/
│   ├── chainConfig.ts
│   ├── createClient.ts
│   ├── createWallet.ts
│   ├── compile.ts
│   ├── deploy.ts
│   └── interact.ts
├── contracts/
│   └── Storage.sol
├── abis/
│   └── Storage.json
└── artifacts/
    └── Storage.bin
```

## Set Up the Project
First, create a new folder and initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir viem-project
cd viem-project
npm init -y
```

## Install Dependencies

Install viem along with other necessary dependencies, including [`solc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc){target=\_blank}, which enables compiling smart contracts' EVM bytecode.

```bash
# Install viem and resolc
npm install viem solc

# Install TypeScript and development dependencies
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/node
```

## Initialize Project

Initialize a TypeScript project by running the following command:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file to enable running TypeScript files:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "client": "ts-node src/createClient.ts",
        "compile": "ts-node src/compile.ts",
        "deploy": "ts-node src/deploy.ts",
        "interact": "ts-node src/interact.ts"
    },
}
```

Create a directory for your TypeScript source files:

```bash
mkdir src
```

## Set Up the Chain Configuration

The first step is to set up the chain configuration. Create a new file at `src/chainConfig.ts`:

```typescript title="src/chainConfig.ts"
import { http } from 'viem';

export const TRANSPORT = http('INSERT_RPC_URL');

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
export const POLKADOT_HUB = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME`, `INSERT_NETWORK_NAME`, `INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS`, `INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME`, and `INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` with the proper values. Check the [Connect to Polkadot](/smart-contracts/connect/){target=\_blank} page for more information on the possible values.

## Set Up the viem Client

To interact with the chain, you need to create a client that is used solely for reading data. To accomplish this, create a new file at `src/createClient.ts`:

```typescript title="src/createClient.ts"
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http } from 'viem';

const transport = http('INSERT_RPC_URL');

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
const assetHub = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;

// Create a public client for reading data
export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: assetHub,
  transport,
});

```

After setting up the [Public Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public#public-client){target=\_blank}, you can begin querying the blockchain. Here's an example of fetching the latest block number:

??? code "Fetch Last Block code"

    ```js title="src/fetchLastBlock.ts"
    import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';

    const transport = http('https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'); // TODO: change to paseo asset hub once ready

    // Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
    const polkadotHubTestnet = {
      id: 420420422,
      name: 'Polkadot Hub TestNet',
      network: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
      nativeCurrency: {
        decimals: 18,
        name: 'PAS',
        symbol: 'PAS',
      },
      rpcUrls: {
        default: {
          http: ['https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'], // TODO: change to paseo asset hub once ready
        },
      },
    } as const;

    // Create a public client for reading data
    export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
      chain: polkadotHubTestnet,
      transport,
    });

    const main = async () => {
      try {
        const block = await publicClient.getBlock();
        console.log('Last block: ' + block.number.toString());
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        console.error('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + error);
      }
    };

    main();
    ```

## Set Up a Wallet

In case you need to sign transactions, you will need to instantiate a [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet#wallet-client){target=\_blank} object within your project. To do so, create `src/createWallet.ts`:

```typescript title="src/createWallet.ts"
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem';

const transport = http('INSERT_RPC_URL');

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
const assetHub = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;

// Create a wallet client for writing data
export const createWallet = (privateKey: `0x${string}`) => {
  const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
  return createWalletClient({
    account,
    chain: assetHub,
    transport,
  });
};
```

!!!note
    The wallet you import with your private key must have sufficient funds to pay for transaction fees when deploying contracts or interacting with them. Make sure to fund your wallet with the appropriate native tokens for the network you're connecting to.

## Sample Smart Contract

This example demonstrates compiling a `Storage.sol` Solidity contract for deployment to Polkadot Hub. The contract's functionality stores a number and permits users to update it with a new value.

```bash
mkdir contracts artifacts
```

You can use the following contract to interact with the blockchain. Paste the following contract in `contracts/Storage.sol`:

```solidity title="contracts/Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
// It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

## Compile the Contract

Create a new file at `src/compile.ts` for handling contract compilation:

```typescript title="src/compile.ts"
import solc from 'solc';
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync, mkdirSync, existsSync } from 'fs';
import { basename, join } from 'path';

const ensureDir = (dirPath: string): void => {
  if (!existsSync(dirPath)) {
    mkdirSync(dirPath, { recursive: true });
  }
};

const compileContract = (
  solidityFilePath: string,
  abiDir: string,
  artifactsDir: string
): void => {
  try {
    // Read the Solidity file
    const source: string = readFileSync(solidityFilePath, 'utf8');
    const fileName: string = basename(solidityFilePath);
    
    // Construct the input object for the Solidity compiler
    const input = {
      language: 'Solidity',
      sources: {
        [fileName]: {
          content: source,
        },
      },
      settings: {
        outputSelection: {
          '*': {
            '*': ['abi', 'evm.bytecode'],
          },
        },
      },
    };
    
    console.log(`Compiling contract: ${fileName}...`);
    
    // Compile the contract
    const output = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
    
    // Check for errors
    if (output.errors) {
      const errors = output.errors.filter((error: any) => error.severity === 'error');
      if (errors.length > 0) {
        console.error('Compilation errors:');
        errors.forEach((err: any) => console.error(err.formattedMessage));
        return;
      }
      // Show warnings
      const warnings = output.errors.filter((error: any) => error.severity === 'warning');
      warnings.forEach((warn: any) => console.warn(warn.formattedMessage));
    }
    
    // Ensure output directories exist
    ensureDir(abiDir);
    ensureDir(artifactsDir);
    
    // Process compiled contracts
    for (const [sourceFile, contracts] of Object.entries(output.contracts)) {
      for (const [contractName, contract] of Object.entries(contracts as any)) {
        console.log(`Compiled contract: ${contractName}`);
        
        // Write the ABI
        const abiPath = join(abiDir, `${contractName}.json`);
        writeFileSync(abiPath, JSON.stringify((contract as any).abi, null, 2));
        console.log(`ABI saved to ${abiPath}`);
        
        // Write the bytecode
        const bytecodePath = join(artifactsDir, `${contractName}.bin`);
        writeFileSync(bytecodePath, (contract as any).evm.bytecode.object);
        console.log(`Bytecode saved to ${bytecodePath}`);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error compiling contracts:', error);
  }
};

const solidityFilePath: string = './contracts/Storage.sol';
const abiDir: string = './abis';
const artifactsDir: string = './artifacts';

compileContract(solidityFilePath, abiDir, artifactsDir);
```

To compile your contract:

```bash
npm run compile
```

After executing this script, you will see the compilation results including the generated `Storage.json` (containing the contract's ABI) and `Storage.bin` (containing the compiled bytecode).

## Deploy the Contract

Create a new file at `src/deploy.ts` for handling contract deployment:

```typescript title="src/deploy.ts"
import { existsSync, readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { dirname, join } from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { createWallet } from './createWallet.ts';
import { publicClient } from './createClient.ts';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);
const ABIS_DIR = join(__dirname, '../abis');
const ARTIFACTS_DIR = join(__dirname, '../artifacts');

const deployContract = async (
  contractName: string,
  privateKey: `0x${string}`
) => {
  try {
    console.log(`Deploying ${contractName}...`);

    const abiPath = join(ABIS_DIR, `${contractName}.json`);
    const bytecodePath = join(ARTIFACTS_DIR, `${contractName}.bin`);

    if (!existsSync(abiPath) || !existsSync(bytecodePath)) {
      throw new Error(
        `Missing artifacts for ${contractName}. Try running "npm run compile" first.`
      );
    }

    // Read contract artifacts
    const abi = JSON.parse(
      readFileSync(abiPath, 'utf8')
    );
    const bytecode = `0x${readFileSync(bytecodePath, 'utf8').trim()}` as `0x${string}`;

    // Create wallet
    const wallet = createWallet(privateKey);

    // Deploy contract
    const hash = await wallet.deployContract({
      abi,
      bytecode,
      args: [], // Add constructor arguments if needed
    });

    // Wait for deployment
    const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
    const contractAddress = receipt.contractAddress;

    console.log(`Contract deployed at: ${contractAddress}`);
    return contractAddress;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Deployment failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

const privateKey = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';
deployContract('Storage', privateKey);
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` with the proper value. For further details on private key exportation, refer to the article [How to export an account's private key](https://support.metamask.io/configure/accounts/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/){target=\_blank}.

!!! warning
    Never commit or share your private key. Exposed keys can lead to immediate theft of all associated funds. Use environment variables instead.

To deploy, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If everything is successful, you will see the address of your deployed contract displayed in the terminal. This address is unique to your contract on the network you defined in the chain configuration, and you'll need it for any future interactions with your contract.

## Interact with the Contract

Create a new file at `src/interact.ts` for interacting with your deployed contract:

```typescript title="src/interact.ts"
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { dirname, join } from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { publicClient } from './createClient.ts';
import { createWallet } from './createWallet.ts';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);
const ABI_PATH = join(__dirname, '../abis/Storage.json');

const STORAGE_ABI = JSON.parse(readFileSync(ABI_PATH, 'utf8'));

const interactWithStorage = async (
  contractAddress: `0x${string}`,
  privateKey: `0x${string}`
) => {
  try {
    const wallet = createWallet(privateKey);
    const currentNumber = await publicClient.readContract({
      address: contractAddress,
      abi: STORAGE_ABI,
      functionName: 'storedNumber',
      args: [],
    });
    console.log(`Stored number: ${currentNumber}`);

    const newNumber = BigInt(42);
    const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract({
      address: contractAddress,
      abi: STORAGE_ABI,
      functionName: 'setNumber',
      args: [newNumber],
      account: wallet.account,
    });

    const hash = await wallet.writeContract(request);
    await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
    console.log(`Number updated to ${newNumber}`);

    const updatedNumber = await publicClient.readContract({
      address: contractAddress,
      abi: STORAGE_ABI,
      functionName: 'storedNumber',
      args: [],
    });
    console.log('Updated stored number:', updatedNumber);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Interaction failed:', error);
  }
};

const PRIVATE_KEY = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

interactWithStorage(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, PRIVATE_KEY);
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the proper values.

To interact with the contract:

```bash
npm run interact
```

Following a successful interaction, you will see the stored value before and after the transaction. The output will show the initial stored number (0 if you haven't modified it yet), confirm when the transaction to set the number to 42 is complete, and then display the updated stored number value. This demonstrates both reading from and writing to your smart contract.

Page Title: Wagmi for Polkadot Hub Smart Contracts

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-libraries-wagmi.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/libraries/wagmi/
- Summary: Learn how to use Wagmi React Hooks to fetch and interact with smart contracts on Polkadot Hub for seamless dApp integration.

# Wagmi

## Introduction

[Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/){target=\_blank} is a collection of [React Hooks](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks){target=\_blank} for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains, focusing on developer experience, feature richness, and reliability.

This guide demonstrates how to use Wagmi to interact with and deploy smart contracts to Polkadot Hub, providing a seamless frontend integration for your dApps.

## Set Up the Project

To start working with Wagmi, create a new React project and initialize it by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest wagmi-polkadot-hub
cd wagmi-polkadot-hub
```

## Install Dependencies

Install Wagmi v3 and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install wagmi@3 viem @tanstack/react-query
```

## Configure Wagmi for Polkadot Hub

Create a configuration file to initialize Wagmi with Polkadot Hub. In your project, create a file named `app/lib/wagmi.ts` and add the code below. Be sure to replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME`, `INSERT_NETWORK_NAME`, `INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS`, `INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME`, and `INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` with your specific values.

```typescript title="app/lib/wagmi.ts"
import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi'

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
const assetHub = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;

// Create Wagmi config
export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [assetHub],
  transports: {
    [assetHub.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

??? code "Example Polkadot Hub TestNet Configuration"

    ```typescript title="src/lib/wagmi.ts"
    import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi';

    // Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
    const assetHub = {
      id: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
      network: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
      nativeCurrency: {
        decimals: 18,
        name: 'PAS',
        symbol: 'PAS',
      },
      rpcUrls: {
        default: {
          http: ['https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'], // TODO: change to paseo asset hub once ready
        },
      },
    } as const;

    // Create wagmi config
    export const config = createConfig({
      chains: [assetHub],
      transports: {
        [assetHub.id]: http(),
      },
    });
    ```

## Set Up the Wagmi Provider

To enable Wagmi in your React application, you need to wrap your app with the [`WagmiProvider`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider#wagmiprovider){target=\_blank}. Update your `app/layout.tsx` file (for Next.js app router) with the following code:

```typescript title="app/layout.tsx"
// For app router (src/app/layout.tsx)
"use client";

import { WagmiProvider } from "wagmi";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { config } from "./lib/wagmi";

// Create a query client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <WagmiProvider config={config}>
          <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
            {children}
          </QueryClientProvider>
        </WagmiProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```

!!!note
    If you are using a Next.js pages router, you should modify the `src/pages/_app.tsx` instead.

## Connect a Wallet

Create a component to connect wallets to your dApp. Create a file named `app/components/ConnectWallet.tsx`:

```typescript title="app/components/ConnectWallet.tsx"
"use client";

import React from "react";
import { useConnect, useConnection, useDisconnect } from "wagmi";
import { injected } from "wagmi/connectors";

export function ConnectWallet() {
  const { connect } = useConnect();
  const { address, isConnected } = useConnection();
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect();

  if (isConnected) {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Connected to {address}</div>
        <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector: injected() })}>
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  );
}

```

This component uses the following React hooks:

- **[`useConnect`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useConnect#useconnect){target=\_blank}**: Provides functions and state for connecting the user's wallet to your dApp. The `connect` function initiates the connection flow with the specified connector.
- **[`useDisconnect`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useDisconnect#usedisconnect){target=\_blank}**: Provides a function to disconnect the currently connected wallet.
- **[`useConnection`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useConnection#useconnection){target=\_blank}**: Returns data about the connected account, including the address and connection status. In Wagmi v3, `useAccount` has been renamed to `useConnection`.

## Fetch Blockchain Data

Wagmi provides various hooks to fetch blockchain data. Here's an example component that demonstrates some of these hooks:

```typescript title="app/components/BlockchainInfo.tsx"
"use client";

import { useBlockNumber, useBalance, useConnection } from "wagmi";

export function BlockchainInfo() {
  const { address } = useConnection();
  // Get the latest block number
  const { data: blockNumber } = useBlockNumber({ watch: true });

  // Get balance for the connected wallet
  const { data: balance } = useBalance({
    address,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Blockchain Information</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Current Block: {blockNumber?.toString() || "Loading..."}</p>

        {address && balance && (
          <p>
            Balance:{" "}
            {(
              BigInt(balance.value) / BigInt(10 ** balance.decimals)
            ).toLocaleString()}{" "}
            {balance.symbol}
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

```

This component uses the following React hooks:

- **[`useBlockNumber`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useBlockNumber#useBlockNumber){target=\_blank}**: Fetches the current block number of the connected chain. The `watch` parameter enables real-time updates when new blocks are mined.
- **[`useBalance`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useBalance#useBalance){target=\_blank}**: Retrieves the native token balance for a specified address, including value, symbol, and decimals information.

## Interact with Deployed Contract

This guide uses a simple Storage contract already deployed to the Polkadot Hub TestNet. The code of that contract is:

??? code "Storage.sol"

    ```solidity title="Storage.sol"
    //SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

    // Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
    // It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
    pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

    contract Storage {
        // Public state variable to store a number
        uint256 public storedNumber;

        /**
        * Updates the stored number.
        *
        * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
        *
        * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
        */
        function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
            storedNumber = _newNumber;
        }
    }
    ```

Create a component to interact with your deployed contract. Create a file named `app/components/StorageContract.tsx`:

```typescript title="app/components/StorageContract.tsx"
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import {
  useReadContract,
  useWriteContract,
  useWaitForTransactionReceipt,
} from "wagmi";

const CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" as `0x${string}`;

export function StorageContract() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState<string>("42");

  // Contract ABI (should match your compiled contract)
  const abi = [
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: "storedNumber",
      outputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "", type: "uint256" }],
      stateMutability: "view",
      type: "function",
    },
    {
      inputs: [
        { internalType: "uint256", name: "_newNumber", type: "uint256" },
      ],
      name: "setNumber",
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    },
  ];

  // Read the current stored number
  const { data: storedNumber, refetch } = useReadContract({
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi,
    functionName: "storedNumber",
  });

  // Write to the contract
  const { writeContract, data: hash, error, isPending } = useWriteContract();

  // Wait for transaction to be mined
  const { isLoading: isConfirming, isSuccess: isConfirmed } =
    useWaitForTransactionReceipt({
      hash,
    });

  const handleSetNumber = () => {
    writeContract({
      address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      abi,
      functionName: "setNumber",
      args: [BigInt(number)],
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Storage Contract Interaction</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Contract Address: {CONTRACT_ADDRESS}</p>
        <p>Current Stored Number: {storedNumber?.toString() || "Loading..."}</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <input
          type="number"
          value={number}
          onChange={(e) => setNumber(e.target.value)}
          disabled={isPending || isConfirming}
        />
        <button onClick={handleSetNumber} disabled={isPending || isConfirming}>
          {isPending
            ? "Waiting for approval..."
            : isConfirming
            ? "Confirming..."
            : "Set Number"}
        </button>
      </div>

      {error && <div className="error-message">Error: {error.message}</div>}

      {isConfirmed && (
        <div className="success-message">
          Successfully updated!{" "}
          <button onClick={() => refetch()}>Refresh</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

```

This component demonstrates how to interact with a smart contract using Wagmi's hooks:

- **[`useReadContract`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useReadContract#useReadContract){target=\_blank}**: Calls a read-only function on your smart contract to retrieve data without modifying the blockchain state.
- **[`useWriteContract`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract#useWriteContract){target=\_blank}**: Calls a state-modifying function on your smart contract, which requires a transaction to be signed and sent.
- **[`useWaitForTransactionReceipt`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWaitForTransactionReceipt#useWaitForTransactionReceipt){target=\_blank}**: Tracks the status of a transaction after it's been submitted, allowing you to know when it's been confirmed.

The component also includes proper state handling to:

- Show the current value stored in the contract.
- Allow users to input a new value.
- Display transaction status (pending, confirming, or completed).
- Handle errors.
- Provide feedback when a transaction is successful.

## Integrate Components

Update your main page to combine all the components. Create or update the file `src/app/page.tsx`:

```typescript title="src/app/page.tsx"
"use client";

import { BlockchainInfo } from "./components/BlockchainInfo";
import { ConnectWallet } from "./components/ConnectWallet";
import { StorageContract } from "./components/StorageContract";
import { useConnection } from "wagmi";

export default function Home() {
  const { isConnected } = useConnection();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Wagmi - Polkadot Hub Smart Contracts</h1>
      <ConnectWallet />
      {isConnected ? <BlockchainInfo /> : <span>Connect your wallet</span>}
      {isConnected ? <StorageContract /> : <span>Connect your wallet</span>}
    </main>
  );
}

```

# Wallets for Polkadot Hub

## Introduction

Connecting a compatible wallet is the first essential step for interacting with the Polkadot Hub ecosystem. This guide explores wallet options that support both Substrate and Ethereum compatible layers, enabling transactions and smart contract interactions. Whether you're a developer testing on Polkadot Hub or a user accessing the MainNet, understanding wallet configuration is crucial for accessing the full range of Polkadot Hub's capabilities.

## Connect Your Wallet

### MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank} is a popular wallet for interacting with Ethereum-compatible chains. It allows users to connect to test networks that support Ethereum-based smart contracts. However, it's important to emphasize that MetaMask primarily facilitates interactions with smart contracts, giving users access to various chain functionalities. 

To get started with MetaMask, you need to install the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/download/){target=\_blank} and add it to the browser. Once you install MetaMask, you can set up a new wallet and securely store your seed phrase. This phrase is crucial for recovery in case you lose access.

For example, to connect to the Polkadot Hub TestNet via MetaMask, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open the MetaMask extension and click on the network icon to switch to the Polkadot Hub TestNet.

    ![](/images/smart-contracts/integrations/wallets/wallets-1.webp){: .browser-extension}

2. Click on the **Add a custom network** button.

    ![](/images/smart-contracts/integrations/wallets/wallets-2.webp){: .browser-extension}

3. Complete the necessary fields, then click the **Save** button (refer to the [Networks](/smart-contracts/connect/#networks-details){target=\_blank} section for copy and paste parameters).

Page Title: Web3.py

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-libraries-web3-py.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/
- Summary: Learn how to interact with Polkadot Hub using the Web3 python library, deploying Solidity contracts, and interacting with deployed smart contracts.

# Web3.py

## Introduction

Interacting with blockchains typically requires an interface between your application and the network. [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html){target=\_blank} offers this interface through a collection of libraries, facilitating seamless interaction with the nodes using HTTP or WebSocket protocols. 

This guide illustrates how to utilize Web3.py for interactions with Polkadot Hub.

## Set Up the Project

1. To start working with Web3.py, begin by initializing your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir web3py-project
    cd web3py-project
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment for your project:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Next, install the Web3.py library:

    ```bash
    pip install web3
    ```

## Set Up the Web3 Provider

The [provider](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html){target=\_blank} configuration is the foundation of any Web3.py application.  It serves as a bridge between your application and the blockchain, allowing you to query blockchain data and interact with smart contracts.

To interact with Polkadot Hub, you must set up a Web3.py provider. This provider connects to a blockchain node, allowing you to query blockchain data and interact with smart contracts. The following code sets up the provider configuration:

```python
from web3 import Web3

PROVIDER_RPC = "INSERT_RPC_URL"
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(PROVIDER_RPC))

```

!!! note
    Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL` with the appropriate value. For instance, to connect to Polkadot Hub TestNet, use the following parameter:

    ```python
    PROVIDER_RPC = 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'
    ```

With the Web3 provider set up, start querying the blockchain. For instance, you can use the following code snippet to fetch the latest block number of the chain.

??? code "Fetch last block example"

    ```python title="fetch_last_block.py"
    from web3 import Web3


    def main():
        try:
            PROVIDER_RPC = "https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io"
            web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(PROVIDER_RPC))
            latest_block = web3.eth.block_number
            print("Last block: " + str(latest_block))
        except Exception as error:
            print("Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: " + str(error))


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

    ```

## Compile Contracts

Polkadot Hub exposes an Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint, so you can compile Solidity contracts to familiar EVM bytecode with the [`py-solc-x`](https://solcx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){target=\_blank} compiler. The resulting artifacts work with any EVM-compatible toolchain and can be deployed through Web3.py.

First, install the `py-solc-x` package:

```bash
pip install py-solc-x

### Sample Storage Smart Contract

This example demonstrates compiling a `Storage.sol` Solidity contract for deployment to Polkadot Hub. The contract's functionality stores a number and permits users to update it with a new value.

```solidity title="Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
// It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

### Compile the Smart Contract

To compile this contract, create a Python script named `compile.py`:

```python title="compile.py"
import json
import solcx
from pathlib import Path

SOLC_VERSION = '0.8.9'
try:
    solcx.install_solc(SOLC_VERSION)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Solc version {SOLC_VERSION} already installed or error: {e}")

solcx.set_solc_version(SOLC_VERSION)

contract_path = Path('Storage.sol')
with open(contract_path, 'r') as file:
    contract_source = file.read()

compiled_sol = solcx.compile_source(
    contract_source,
    output_values=['abi', 'bin'],
    solc_version=SOLC_VERSION
)

contract_id, contract_interface = compiled_sol.popitem()

bytecode = contract_interface['bin']
abi = contract_interface['abi']

Path('abis').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
Path('artifacts').mkdir(exist_ok=True)

with open('abis/Storage.json', 'w') as abi_file:
    json.dump(abi, abi_file, indent=2)

with open('artifacts/Storage.bin', 'w') as bin_file:
    bin_file.write(bytecode)

print("✅ Contract compiled successfully!")
print(f"📄 ABI saved to: abis/Storage.json")
print(f"📦 Bytecode saved to: artifacts/Storage.bin")
```

!!! note 
    The script above is tailored to the `Storage.sol` contract. It can be adjusted for other contracts by changing the file name or modifying the ABI and bytecode paths.

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a JSON representation of your contract's functions, events, and their parameters. It serves as the interface between your Python code and the deployed smart contract, allowing your application to know how to format function calls and interpret returned data.

Execute the script by running:

```bash
python compile.py
```

After executing the script, the Solidity contract is compiled into standard EVM bytecode. The ABI and bytecode are saved into files with `.json` and `.bin` extensions, respectively:

- **ABI file (`abis/Storage.json`)**: Provides a JSON interface describing the contract's functions and how to interact with it.
- **Bytecode file (`artifacts/Storage.bin`)**: Contains the low-level machine code executable on EVM that represents the compiled smart contract ready for blockchain deployment.

You can now proceed with deploying the contract to Polkadot Hub, as outlined in the next section.

## Contract Deployment

To deploy your compiled contract to Polkadot Hub using Web3.py, you'll need an account with a private key to sign the deployment transaction. The deployment process is exactly the same as for any Ethereum-compatible chain, involving creating a contract instance, estimating gas, and sending a deployment transaction. Here's how to deploy the contract. Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL` and `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` with the appropriate values:

```python title="deploy.py"
from web3 import Web3
import json
import time
from pathlib import Path

ARTIFACTS_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
ABI_DIR = ARTIFACTS_DIR / "abis"
BYTECODE_DIR = ARTIFACTS_DIR / "artifacts"

def get_abi(contract_name):
    try:
        with open(ABI_DIR / f"{contract_name}.json", 'r') as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"❌ Could not find ABI for contract {contract_name}: {error}")
        raise error

def get_bytecode(contract_name):
    try:
        with open(BYTECODE_DIR / f"{contract_name}.bin", 'r') as file:
            bytecode = file.read().strip()
            return bytecode if bytecode.startswith('0x') else f"0x{bytecode}"
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"❌ Could not find bytecode for contract {contract_name}: {error}")
        raise error

def deploy_with_retry(config, max_retries=3):
    """Deploy with retry logic for RPC errors"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return deploy(config)
        except Exception as error:
            error_str = str(error)
            if "500" in error_str or "Internal Server Error" in error_str or "Connection" in error_str:
                if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                    wait_time = (attempt + 1) * 3
                    print(f"RPC error, retrying in {wait_time} seconds... (attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_retries})")
                    time.sleep(wait_time)
                    continue
            raise error

def deploy(config):
    try:
        # Initialize Web3 with RPC URL and longer timeout
        web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(
            config["rpc_url"],
            request_kwargs={'timeout': 120}
        ))
        
        # Prepare account
        formatted_private_key = config["private_key"] if config["private_key"].startswith('0x') else f"0x{config['private_key']}"
        account = web3.eth.account.from_key(formatted_private_key)
        print(f"Deploying from address: {account.address}")
        
        # Load ABI and bytecode
        abi = get_abi('Storage')
        bytecode = get_bytecode('Storage')
        print(f"Bytecode length: {len(bytecode)}")
        
        # Create contract instance
        contract = web3.eth.contract(abi=abi, bytecode=bytecode)
        
        # Get current nonce (this will test the connection)
        print("Getting nonce...")
        nonce = web3.eth.get_transaction_count(account.address)
        print(f"Nonce: {nonce}")
        
        # Estimate gas
        print("Estimating gas...")
        gas_estimate = web3.eth.estimate_gas({
            'from': account.address,
            'data': bytecode
        })
        print(f"Estimated gas: {gas_estimate}")
        
        # Get gas price
        print("Getting gas price...")
        gas_price = web3.eth.gas_price
        print(f"Gas price: {web3.from_wei(gas_price, 'gwei')} gwei")
        
        # Build deployment transaction
        print("Building transaction...")
        construct_txn = contract.constructor().build_transaction({
            'from': account.address,
            'nonce': nonce,
            'gas': gas_estimate,
            'gasPrice': gas_price,
        })
        
        # Sign transaction
        print("Signing transaction...")
        signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(construct_txn, private_key=formatted_private_key)
        
        # Send transaction
        print("Sending transaction...")
        tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.raw_transaction)
        print(f"Transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")
        
        # Wait for transaction receipt
        print("Waiting for transaction receipt...")
        tx_receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash, timeout=300)
        contract_address = tx_receipt.contractAddress
        
        # Log results
        print(f"✅ Contract deployed at: {contract_address}")
        print(f"Gas used: {tx_receipt.gasUsed}")
        print(f"Block number: {tx_receipt.blockNumber}")
        
        return web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)
    
    except Exception as error:
        print(f'❌ Deployment failed: {error}')
        raise error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    deployment_config = {
        "rpc_url": "https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io",
        "private_key": "0xd505c673c48556d560696d129f0e611f041638cd42d81c33ddc0e490cdcf65fc"
    }
    
    deploy_with_retry(deployment_config)
```

!!!warning
    Never commit or share your private key. Exposed keys can lead to immediate theft of all associated funds.

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
python deploy.py
```

After running this script, your contract will be deployed to Polkadot Hub, and its address will be printed in your terminal. You can use this address for future contract interactions.

## Interact with the Contract

After deployment, interact with your contract using Web3.py methods. The example below demonstrates how to set and retrieve a number.

```python title="update_storage.py"
from web3 import Web3
import json


def get_abi(contract_name):
    try:
        with open(f"{contract_name}.json", "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"❌ Could not find ABI for contract {contract_name}: {error}")
        raise error


async def update_storage(config):
    try:
        # Initialize Web3 with RPC URL
        web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(config["rpc_url"]))

        # Prepare account
        account = web3.eth.account.from_key(config["private_key"])

        # Load ABI
        abi = get_abi("Storage")

        # Create contract instance
        contract = web3.eth.contract(address=config["contract_address"], abi=abi)

        # Get initial value
        initial_value = contract.functions.storedNumber().call()
        print("Current stored value:", initial_value)

        # Get current nonce
        nonce = web3.eth.get_transaction_count(account.address)

        # Prepare transaction
        transaction = contract.functions.setNumber(1).build_transaction(
            {"from": account.address, "nonce": nonce}
        )

        # Sign transaction
        signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(
            transaction, private_key=config["private_key"]
        )

        # Send transaction
        tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.raw_transaction)
        print(f"Transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")

        # Wait for receipt
        receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

        # Get updated value
        new_value = contract.functions.storedNumber().call()
        print("New stored value:", new_value)

        return receipt

    except Exception as error:
        print("Update failed:", error)
        raise error


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    import asyncio

    config = {
        "rpc_url": "INSERT_RPC_URL",
        "private_key": "INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "contract_address": "INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
    }

    asyncio.run(update_storage(config))

```

Be sure to replace the `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` placeholders with your specific values.

To interact with the contract, run:

```bash
python update_storage.py
```

Page Title: XCM Tools

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/reference-tools-xcm-tools.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/reference/tools/xcm-tools/
- Summary: Explore essential XCM tools across Polkadot, crafted to enhance cross-chain functionality and integration within the ecosystem.

# XCM Tools

## Introduction

As described in the [Interoperability](/develop/interoperability){target=\_blank} section, XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) is a protocol used in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to enable communication and interaction between chains. It facilitates cross-chain communication, allowing assets, data, and messages to flow seamlessly across the ecosystem.

As XCM is central to enabling communication between blockchains, developers need robust tools to help interact with, build, and test XCM messages. Several XCM tools simplify working with the protocol by providing libraries, frameworks, and utilities that enhance the development process, ensuring that applications built within the Polkadot ecosystem can efficiently use cross-chain functionalities.

## Popular XCM Tools

### Moonsong Labs XCM Tools

[Moonsong Labs XCM Tools](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/xcm-tools){target=\_blank} provides a collection of scripts for managing and testing XCM operations between Polkadot SDK-based runtimes. These tools allow performing tasks like asset registration, channel setup, and XCM initialization. Key features include:

- **Asset registration**: Registers assets, setting units per second (up-front fees), and configuring error (revert) codes.
- **XCM initializer**: Initializes XCM, sets default XCM versions, and configures revert codes for XCM-related precompiles.
- **HRMP manipulator**: Manages HRMP channel actions, including opening, accepting, or closing channels.
- **XCM-Transactor-Info-Setter**: Configures transactor information, including extra weight and fee settings.
- **Decode XCM**: Decodes XCM messages on the relay chain or parachains to help interpret cross-chain communication.

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/xcm-tools && 
cd xcm-tools &&
yarn install
```

For a full overview of each script, visit the [scripts](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/xcm-tools/tree/main/scripts){target=\_blank} directory or refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/xcm-tools/blob/main/README.md){target=\_blank} on GitHub.

### ParaSpell

[ParaSpell](/reference/tools/paraspell/){target=\_blank} is a collection of open-source XCM tools that streamline cross-chain asset transfers and interactions across the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. It provides developers with an intuitive interface to build, test, and deploy interoperable dApps, featuring message composition, decoding, and practical utilities for parachain interactions that simplify debugging and cross-chain communication optimization.

### Astar XCM Tools

The [Astar parachain](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/tree/master){target=\_blank} offers a crate with a set of utilities for interacting with the XCM protocol. The [xcm-tools](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/tree/master/bin/xcm-tools){target=\_blank} crate provides a straightforward method for users to locate a sovereign account or calculate an XC20 asset ID. Some commands included by the xcm-tools crate allow users to perform the following tasks:

- **Sovereign accounts**: Obtain the sovereign account address for any parachain, either on the Relay Chain or for sibling parachains, using a simple command.
- **XC20 EVM addresses**: Generate XC20-compatible Ethereum addresses for assets by entering the asset ID, making it easy to integrate assets across Ethereum-compatible environments.
- **Remote accounts**: Retrieve remote account addresses needed for multi-location compatibility, using flexible options to specify account types and parachain IDs.

To start using these tools, clone the [Astar repository](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar){target=\_blank} and compile the xcm-tools package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar &&
cd Astar &&
cargo build --release -p xcm-tools
```

After compiling, verify the setup with the following command:

```bash
./target/release/xcm-tools --help
```
For more details on using Astar xcm-tools, consult the [official documentation](https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/interoperability/xcm/integration/tools/){target=\_blank}.

### Chopsticks

The Chopsticks library provides XCM functionality for testing XCM messages across networks, enabling you to fork multiple parachains along with a relay chain. For further details, see the [Chopsticks documentation](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/){target=\_blank} about XCM.

### Moonbeam XCM SDK

The [Moonbeam XCM SDK](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk){target=\_blank} enables developers to easily transfer assets between chains, either between parachains or between a parachain and the relay chain, within the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. With the SDK, you don't need to worry about determining the [Multilocation](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#7-universal-consensus-location-identifiers){target=\_blank} of the origin or destination assets or which extrinsics are used on which networks.

The SDK consists of two main packages:

- **[XCM SDK](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/tree/main/packages/sdk){target=\_blank}**: Core SDK for executing XCM transfers between chains in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.
- **[MRL SDK](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/tree/main/packages/mrl){target=\_blank}**: Extension of the XCM SDK for transferring liquidity into and across the Polkadot ecosystem from other ecosystems like Ethereum.

Key features include:

- **Simplified asset transfers**: Abstracts away complex multilocation determinations and extrinsic selection.
- **Cross-ecosystem support**: Enables transfers between Polkadot/Kusama chains and external ecosystems.
- **Developer-friendly API**: Provides intuitive interfaces for cross-chain functionality.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Includes usage guides and API references for both packages.

Page Title: Zero to Hero Smart Contract DApp

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/.ai/pages/smart-contracts-cookbook-dapps-zero-to-hero.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/cookbook/dapps/zero-to-hero/
- Summary: Learn how to build a decentralized application on Polkadot Hub using Viem and Next.js by creating a simple dApp that interacts with a smart contract.

# Zero to Hero Smart Contract DApp

Decentralized applications (dApps) are a key component of the Web3 ecosystem, enabling developers to build applications that communicate directly with blockchain networks. Polkadot Hub, a blockchain with smart contract support, serves as a robust platform for deploying and interacting with dApps.

This tutorial will guide you through building a fully functional dApp that interacts with a smart contract on Polkadot Hub. You'll create and deploy a smart contract with Hardhat, and then use [Viem](https://viem.sh/){target=\_blank} for blockchain interactions and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/){target=\_blank} for the frontend. By the end, you'll have a dApp that lets users connect their wallets, retrieve on-chain data, and execute transactions.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en){target=\_blank} v22.10.0 or later installed on your system.
- A crypto wallet (such as MetaMask) funded with test tokens. Refer to the [Connect to Polkadot](/smart-contracts/connect){target=\_blank} guide for more details.
- A basic understanding of React and JavaScript.
- Some familiarity with blockchain fundamentals and Solidity (helpful but not required).

## Project Overview

This dApp will interact with a basic Storage contract that you will create and deploy with Hardhat. The contract will allow you to:

- Store a number on the blockchain.
- Retrieve the stored number from the blockchain.
- Update the stored number with a new value.

Your project directory will be organized as follows:

```bash
polkadot-hub-tutorial/
├── storage-contract/          # Hardhat project for smart contract
│   ├── contracts/
│   │   └── Storage.sol
│   ├── scripts/
│   │   └── deploy.ts
│   ├── artifacts/
│   │   └── contracts/
│   │       └── Storage.sol/
│   │           └── Storage.json
│   ├── hardhat.config.ts
│   ├── .env
│   └── package.json
│
└── dapp/                 # Next.js dApp project
    ├── abis/
    │   └── Storage.json
    └── app/
        ├── components/
        │   ├── ReadContract.tsx
        │   ├── WalletConnect.tsx
        │   └── WriteContract.tsx
        ├── utils/
        │   ├── contract.ts
        │   └── viem.ts
        ├── favicon.ico
        ├── globals.css
        ├── layout.tsx
        └── page.tsx
```

Create the main folder for the project:

```bash
mkdir polkadot-hub-tutorial
cd polkadot-hub-tutorial
```

## Create and Deploy the Storage Contract

Before building the dApp, you'll need to create and deploy the Storage smart contract. This section will guide you through using Hardhat to write, compile, and deploy the contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet.

### Set Up Hardhat Project

First, create a new directory for your Hardhat project and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir storage-contract
cd storage-contract
npm init -y
```

Install Hardhat and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat@3.0.9
```

Initialize a new Hardhat project:

```bash
npx hardhat --init
```

Select **Create a TypeScript project** and accept the default options.

### Create the Storage Contract

In the `contracts` directory, create a new file called `Storage.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity title="Storage.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Storage {
    uint256 private storedNumber;

    event NumberStored(uint256 newNumber);

    function setNumber(uint256 _number) public {
        storedNumber = _number;
        emit NumberStored(_number);
    }
}
```

This simple contract stores a single number and provides functions to read and update it.

### Configure Hardhat for Polkadot Hub

Update your `hardhat.config.ts` file to include the Polkadot Hub TestNet configuration:

```typescript title="hardhat.config.ts" hl_lines="39-44"
import type { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";

import hardhatToolboxViemPlugin from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem";
import { configVariable } from "hardhat/config";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxViemPlugin],
  solidity: {
    profiles: {
      default: {
        version: "0.8.28",
      },
      production: {
        version: "0.8.28",
        settings: {
          optimizer: {
            enabled: true,
            runs: 200,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  networks: {
    hardhatMainnet: {
      type: "edr-simulated",
      chainType: "l1",
    },
    hardhatOp: {
      type: "edr-simulated",
      chainType: "op",
    },
    sepolia: {
      type: "http",
      chainType: "l1",
      url: configVariable("SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"),
      accounts: [configVariable("SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY")],
    },
    polkadotTestNet: {
      type: "http",
      chainType: "l1",
      url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8545',
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || ''],
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of your Hardhat project:

```text title=".env"
PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

Replace `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE` with your actual private key. You can get this by exporting the private key from your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

!!! warning
    Never commit your private key to version control. Use environment variables or a `.env` file (and add it to `.gitignore`) to manage sensitive information. Keep your private key safe, and never share it with anyone. If it is compromised, your funds can be stolen.


### Compile the Contract

Compile your Storage contract:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

You should see output indicating successful compilation.

### Deploy the Contract

Create a deployment script in the `ignition/modules` directory called `Storage.ts`:

```typescript title="Storage.ts"
import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";

export default buildModule("StorageModule", (m) => {
  const storage = m.contract("Storage");

  return { storage };
});
```

Deploy the contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Storage.ts --network polkadotTestNet
```

You should see output similar to:

</div>

!!! note
    Save the deployed contract address - you'll need it when building your dApp. In the following sections, we'll reference a pre-deployed contract at `0xc01Ee7f10EA4aF4673cFff62710E1D7792aBa8f3`, but you can use your own deployed contract address instead.

### Export the Contract ABI

After deployment, you'll need the contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI) for your dApp. You can find it in the `artifacts/contracts/Storage.sol/Storage.json` file generated by Hardhat. You'll use this in the next section when setting up your dApp.

Now that you have your contract deployed, you're ready to build the dApp that will interact with it!

## Set Up the DApp Project

Navigate to the root of the project, and create a new Next.js project called `dapp`:

```bash
npx create-next-app dapp --ts --eslint --tailwind --app --yes
cd dapp
```

## Install Dependencies

Install viem and related packages:

```bash
npm install viem@2.38.5
npm install --save-dev typescript@5.9.3 @types/node@22.19.24
```

## Connect to Polkadot Hub

To interact with Polkadot Hub, you need to set up a [Public Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public#public-client){target=\_blank} that connects to the blockchain. In this example, you will interact with the Polkadot Hub TestNet, to experiment safely. Start by creating a new file called `utils/viem.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript title="viem.ts"
import { createPublicClient, http, createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import 'viem/window';

const transport = http('http://127.0.0.1:8545') // TODO: change to the paseo asset hub RPC URL when it's available

// Configure the Polkadot Testnet Hub chain
export const polkadotTestnet = {
  id: 420420420,
  name: 'Polkadot Testnet',
  network: 'polkadot-testnet',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: 'PAS',
    symbol: 'PAS',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['http://127.0.0.1:8545'], // TODO: change to the paseo asset hub RPC URL
    },
  },
} as const

// Create a public client for reading data
export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: polkadotTestnet,
  transport
})

// Create a wallet client for signing transactions
export const getWalletClient = async () => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.ethereum) {
    const [account] = await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
    return createWalletClient({
      chain: polkadotTestnet,
      transport: custom(window.ethereum),
      account,
    });
  }
  throw new Error('No Ethereum browser provider detected');
};
```

This file initializes a viem client, providing helper functions for obtaining a Public Client and a [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet#wallet-client){target=\_blank}. The Public Client enables reading blockchain data, while the Wallet Client allows users to sign and send transactions. Also, note that by importing `viem/window` the global `window.ethereum` will be typed as an `EIP1193Provider`, check the [`window` Polyfill](https://viem.sh/docs/typescript#window-polyfill){target=\_blank} reference for more information.

## Set Up the Smart Contract Interface

For this dApp, you'll use a simple [Storage contract](/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-basic/basic-hardhat/#create-the-contract){target=\_blank} that's already deployed in the Polkadot Hub TestNet: `0xc01Ee7f10EA4aF4673cFff62710E1D7792aBa8f3`. To interact with it, you need to define the contract interface.

Create a folder called `abis` at the root of your project, then create a file named `Storage.json` and paste the corresponding ABI of the Storage contract. You can copy and paste the following:

```bash
cp ./storage-contract/artifacts/contracts/Storage.sol/Storage.json ./dapp/abis/Storage.json
```

Next, create a file called `utils/contract.ts`:

```typescript title="contract.ts"
import { getContract } from 'viem';
import { publicClient, getWalletClient } from './viem';
import StorageABI from '../abis/Storage.json';

export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0xc01Ee7f10EA4aF4673cFff62710E1D7792aBa8f3'; // TODO: change when the paseo asset hub RPC URL is available, and the contract is redeployed
export const CONTRACT_ABI = StorageABI.abi;

// Create a function to get a contract instance for reading
export const getContractInstance = () => {
  return getContract({
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi: CONTRACT_ABI,
    client: publicClient,
  });
};

// Create a function to get a contract instance with a signer for writing
export const getSignedContract = async () => {
  const walletClient = await getWalletClient();
  return getContract({
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi: CONTRACT_ABI,
    client: walletClient,
  });
};
```

This file defines the contract address, ABI, and functions to create a viem [contract instance](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract#contract-instances){target=\_blank} for reading and writing operations. viem's contract utilities enable more efficient, type-safe interaction with smart contracts.

## Create the Wallet Connection Component

Now, you can create a component to handle wallet connections. Create a new file called `components/WalletConnect.tsx`:

```typescript title="WalletConnect.tsx"
"use client";

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { polkadotTestnet } from "../utils/viem";

interface WalletConnectProps {
  onConnect: (account: string) => void;
}

const WalletConnect: React.FC<WalletConnectProps> = ({ onConnect }) => {
  const [account, setAccount] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [chainId, setChainId] = useState<number | null>(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if user already has an authorized wallet connection
    const checkConnection = async () => {
      if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.ethereum) {
        try {
          // eth_accounts doesn't trigger the wallet popup
          const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
            method: 'eth_accounts',
          }) as string[];
          
          if (accounts.length > 0) {
            setAccount(accounts[0]);
            const chainIdHex = await window.ethereum.request({
              method: 'eth_chainId',
            }) as string;
            setChainId(parseInt(chainIdHex, 16));
            onConnect(accounts[0]);
          }
        } catch (err) {
          console.error('Error checking connection:', err);
          setError('Failed to check wallet connection');
        }
      }
    };

    checkConnection();

    if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.ethereum) {
      // Setup wallet event listeners
      window.ethereum.on('accountsChanged', (accounts: string[]) => {
        setAccount(accounts[0] || null);
        if (accounts[0]) onConnect(accounts[0]);
      });

      window.ethereum.on('chainChanged', (chainIdHex: string) => {
        setChainId(parseInt(chainIdHex, 16));
      });
    }

    return () => {
      // Cleanup event listeners
      if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.ethereum) {
        window.ethereum.removeListener('accountsChanged', () => {});
        window.ethereum.removeListener('chainChanged', () => {});
      }
    };
  }, [onConnect]);

  const connectWallet = async () => {
    if (typeof window === 'undefined' || !window.ethereum) {
      setError(
        'MetaMask not detected! Please install MetaMask to use this dApp.'
      );
      return;
    }

    try {
      // eth_requestAccounts triggers the wallet popup
      const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
        method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
      }) as string[];
      
      setAccount(accounts[0]);

      const chainIdHex = await window.ethereum.request({
        method: 'eth_chainId',
      }) as string;
      
      const currentChainId = parseInt(chainIdHex, 16);
      setChainId(currentChainId);

      // Prompt user to switch networks if needed
      if (currentChainId !== polkadotTestnet.id) {
        await switchNetwork();
      }

      onConnect(accounts[0]);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error connecting to wallet:', err);
      setError('Failed to connect wallet');
    }
  };

  const switchNetwork = async () => {
    console.log('Switch network')
    try {
      await window.ethereum.request({
        method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',
        params: [{ chainId: `0x${polkadotTestnet.id.toString(16)}` }],
      });
    } catch (switchError: any) {
      // Error 4902 means the chain hasn't been added to MetaMask
      if (switchError.code === 4902) {
        try {
          await window.ethereum.request({
            method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
            params: [
              {
                chainId: `0x${polkadotTestnet.id.toString(16)}`,
                chainName: polkadotTestnet.name,
                rpcUrls: [polkadotTestnet.rpcUrls.default.http[0]],
                nativeCurrency: {
                  name: polkadotTestnet.nativeCurrency.name,
                  symbol: polkadotTestnet.nativeCurrency.symbol,
                  decimals: polkadotTestnet.nativeCurrency.decimals,
                },
              },
            ],
          });
        } catch (addError) {
          setError('Failed to add network to wallet');
        }
      } else {
        setError('Failed to switch network');
      }
    }
  };

  // UI-only disconnection - MetaMask doesn't support programmatic disconnection
  const disconnectWallet = () => {
    setAccount(null);
  };

  return (
    <div className="border border-pink-500 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-md bg-white text-pink-500 max-w-sm mx-auto">
      {error && <p className="text-red-500 text-sm mb-2">{error}</p>}

      {!account ? (
        <button
          onClick={connectWallet}
          className="w-full bg-pink-500 hover:bg-pink-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-lg transition"
        >
          Connect Wallet
        </button>
      ) : (
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <span className="text-sm font-mono bg-pink-100 px-2 py-1 rounded-md text-pink-700">
            {`${account.substring(0, 6)}...${account.substring(38)}`}
          </span>
          <button
            onClick={disconnectWallet}
            className="mt-3 w-full bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 text-pink-500 py-2 px-4 rounded-lg transition"
          >
            Disconnect
          </button>
          {chainId !== polkadotTestnet.id && (
            <button
              onClick={switchNetwork}
              className="mt-3 w-full bg-yellow-500 hover:bg-yellow-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-lg transition"
            >
              Switch to Polkadot Testnet
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default WalletConnect;
```

This component handles connecting to the wallet, switching networks if necessary, and keeping track of the connected account. It provides a button for users to connect their wallet and displays the connected account address once connected.

## Create the Read Contract Component

Next, create a component to read data from the contract. Create a file called `components/ReadContract.tsx`:

```typescript title="ReadContract.tsx"
'use client';

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { publicClient } from '../utils/viem';
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS, CONTRACT_ABI } from '../utils/contract';

const ReadContract: React.FC = () => {
  const [storedNumber, setStoredNumber] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Function to read data from the blockchain
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        // Call the smart contract's storedNumber function
        const number = await publicClient.readContract({
            address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
            abi: CONTRACT_ABI,
            functionName: 'storedNumber',
            args: [],
          }) as bigint;

        setStoredNumber(number.toString());
        setError(null);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error fetching stored number:', err);
        setError('Failed to fetch data from the contract');
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    // Poll for updates every 10 seconds to keep UI in sync with blockchain
    const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 10000);

    // Clean up interval on component unmount
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="border border-pink-500 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-md bg-white text-pink-500 max-w-sm mx-auto">
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-center mb-4">Contract Data</h2>
      {loading ? (
        <div className="flex justify-center my-4">
          <div className="w-6 h-6 border-4 border-pink-500 border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin"></div>
        </div>
      ) : error ? (
        <p className="text-red-500 text-center">{error}</p>
      ) : (
        <div className="text-center">
          <p className="text-sm font-mono bg-pink-100 px-2 py-1 rounded-md text-pink-700">
            <strong>Stored Number:</strong> {storedNumber}
          </p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ReadContract;
```

This component reads the `storedNumber` value from the contract and displays it to the user. It also sets up a polling interval to refresh the data periodically, ensuring that the UI stays in sync with the blockchain state.

## Create the Write Contract Component

Finally, create a component that allows users to update the stored number. Create a file called `components/WriteContract.tsx`:

```typescript title="WriteContract.tsx"
"use client";

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { publicClient, getWalletClient } from '../utils/viem';
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS, CONTRACT_ABI } from '../utils/contract';

interface WriteContractProps {
  account: string | null;
}

const WriteContract: React.FC<WriteContractProps> = ({ account }) => {
  const [newNumber, setNewNumber] = useState<string>("");
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<{
    type: string | null;
    message: string;
  }>({
    type: null,
    message: "",
  });
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [isCorrectNetwork, setIsCorrectNetwork] = useState<boolean>(true);

  // Check if the account is on the correct network
  useEffect(() => {
    const checkNetwork = async () => {
      if (!account) return;

      try {
        // Get the chainId from the public client
        const chainId = await publicClient.getChainId();

        // Get the user's current chainId from their wallet
        const walletClient = await getWalletClient();
        if (!walletClient) return;

        const walletChainId = await walletClient.getChainId();

        // Check if they match
        setIsCorrectNetwork(chainId === walletChainId);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error("Error checking network:", err);
        setIsCorrectNetwork(false);
      }
    };

    checkNetwork();
  }, [account]);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    // Validation checks
    if (!account) {
      setStatus({ type: "error", message: "Please connect your wallet first" });
      return;
    }

    if (!isCorrectNetwork) {
      setStatus({
        type: "error",
        message: "Please switch to the correct network in your wallet",
      });
      return;
    }

    if (!newNumber || isNaN(Number(newNumber))) {
      setStatus({ type: "error", message: "Please enter a valid number" });
      return;
    }

    try {
      setIsSubmitting(true);
      setStatus({ type: "info", message: "Initiating transaction..." });

      // Get wallet client for transaction signing
      const walletClient = await getWalletClient();

      if (!walletClient) {
        setStatus({ type: "error", message: "Wallet client not available" });
        return;
      }

      // Check if account matches
      if (
        walletClient.account?.address.toLowerCase() !== account.toLowerCase()
      ) {
        setStatus({
          type: "error",
          message:
            "Connected wallet account doesn't match the selected account",
        });
        return;
      }

      // Prepare transaction and wait for user confirmation in wallet
      setStatus({
        type: "info",
        message: "Please confirm the transaction in your wallet...",
      });

      // Simulate the contract call first
      console.log('newNumber', newNumber);
      const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract({
        address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        abi: CONTRACT_ABI,
        functionName: "setNumber",
        args: [BigInt(newNumber)],
        account: walletClient.account,
      });

      // Send the transaction with wallet client
      const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(request);

      // Wait for transaction to be mined
      setStatus({
        type: "info",
        message: "Transaction submitted. Waiting for confirmation...",
      });

      const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
        hash,
      });

      setStatus({
        type: "success",
        message: `Transaction confirmed! Transaction hash: ${receipt.transactionHash}`,
      });

      setNewNumber("");
    } catch (err: any) {
      console.error("Error updating number:", err);

      // Handle specific errors
      if (err.code === 4001) {
        // User rejected transaction
        setStatus({ type: "error", message: "Transaction rejected by user." });
      } else if (err.message?.includes("Account not found")) {
        // Account not found on the network
        setStatus({
          type: "error",
          message:
            "Account not found on current network. Please check your wallet is connected to the correct network.",
        });
      } else if (err.message?.includes("JSON is not a valid request object")) {
        // JSON error - specific to your current issue
        setStatus({
          type: "error",
          message:
            "Invalid request format. Please try again or contact support.",
        });
      } else {
        // Other errors
        setStatus({
          type: "error",
          message: `Error: ${err.message || "Failed to send transaction"}`,
        });
      }
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="border border-pink-500 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-md bg-white text-pink-500 max-w-sm mx-auto space-y-4">

          Connect your wallet to update the stored number.
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default WriteContract;
```

This component allows users to input a new number and send a transaction to update the value stored in the contract. It provides appropriate feedback during each step of the transaction process and handles error scenarios.

Update the `app/page.tsx` file to integrate all components:

```typescript title="page.tsx"
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import WalletConnect from "./components/WalletConnect";
import ReadContract from "./components/ReadContract";
import WriteContract from "./components/WriteContract";

export default function Home() {
  const [account, setAccount] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleConnect = (connectedAccount: string) => {
    setAccount(connectedAccount);
  };

  return (
    <section className="min-h-screen bg-white text-black flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-4 py-10">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-center">
        Polkadot Hub - Zero To Hero DApp
      </h1>
      <WalletConnect onConnect={handleConnect} />
      <ReadContract />
      <WriteContract account={account} />
    </section>
  );
}
```

Run the dApp:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see your dApp with the wallet connection button, the stored number displayed, and the form to update the number. You should see something like this:



## How It Works

This dApp uses components to interact with the blockchain in several ways.

### Wallet Connection 

The `WalletConnect` component uses the browser's Ethereum provider (MetaMask) to connect to the user's wallet and handles network switching to ensure the user is connected to the Polkadot Hub TestNet. Once connected, it provides the user's account address to the parent component.

### Data Reads

The `ReadContract` component uses viem's `readContract` function to call the `storedNumber` view function and periodically poll for updates to keep the UI in sync with the blockchain state. The component also displays a loading indicator while fetching data and handles error states.

### Data Writes

The `WriteContract` component uses viem's `writeContract` function to send a transaction to the `setNumber` function and ensures the wallet is connected before allowing a transaction. The component shows detailed feedback during transaction submission and confirmation. After a successful transaction, the value displayed in the `ReadContract` component will update on the next poll.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully built a fully functional dApp that interacts with a smart contract on Polkadot Hub using viem and Next.js. Your application can now:

- Create a smart contract with Hardhat and deploy it to Polkadot Hub TestNet.
- Connect to a user's wallet and handle network switching.
- Read data from a smart contract and keep it updated.
- Write data to the blockchain through transactions.

These fundamental skills provide the foundation for building more complex dApps on Polkadot Hub. With this knowledge, you can extend your application to interact with more sophisticated smart contracts and create advanced user interfaces.

To get started right away with a working example, you can clone the repository and navigate to the implementation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples.git
cd zero-to-hero-dapp
```

# Zombienet

## Introduction

Zombienet is a testing framework designed for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. It enables developers to efficiently deploy and test ephemeral blockchain environments on platforms like Kubernetes, Podman, and native setups. With its simple CLI and Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing tests, Zombienet streamlines network spawning, testing, and performance validation.

Key features include:

- **Multi-provider support**: Run networks on Kubernetes, Podman, or locally as native processes.
- **Network orchestration**: Spawn relay chains with multiple validators and parachains with collators.
- **Test DSL**: Write natural-language test scripts to evaluate metrics, logs, events, and on-chain storage.
- **Monitoring integration**: Built-in support for Prometheus, Grafana, and Tempo on supported providers.

## Install Zombienet

Zombienet releases are available on the [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=\_blank}. Choose one of the following installation methods:

=== "Use the executable"

    Download the appropriate executable for your operating system from the [latest release](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases){target=\_blank} page. Each release includes executables for Linux and macOS.

    Make the downloaded file executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x zombienet-macos-arm64
    ```

    Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    ./zombienet-macos-arm64 version
    ```

    Optionally, move the executable to your PATH:

    ```bash
    mv zombienet-macos-arm64 /usr/local/bin/zombienet
    ```

    Now you can use the `zombienet` command directly:

    ```bash
    zombienet version
    ```

=== "Use Nix"

    For Nix users, the Zombienet repository provides a [`flake.nix`](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/blob/main/flake.nix){target=\_blank} file. You need [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes){target=\_blank} enabled.
    
    Run Zombienet directly:

    ```bash
    nix run github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION -- \
    spawn INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME.toml
    ```

    Or include Zombienet in your current shell:
    
    ```bash
    nix shell github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION
    ```

=== "Use Docker"

    Run Zombienet using Docker:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files \
    paritytech/zombienet
    ```

    Inside the container, set up the necessary binaries:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    Add the binaries to your PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/home/nonroot/zombie-net:$PATH
    ```

    Spawn a network:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- -p native spawn host-current-files/minimal.toml
    ```

## Providers

Zombienet supports different backend providers for running nodes: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){target=\_blank}, [Podman](https://podman.io/){target=\_blank}, and native (local processes). Specify the provider using the `--provider` flag or in your network configuration file:

```bash
zombienet spawn network.toml --provider INSERT_PROVIDER
```

Or set it in the configuration:

```toml title="network.toml"
[settings]
provider = "INSERT_PROVIDER"
...
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_PROVIDER` with the appropriate provider: `kubernetes`, `podman`, or `native`.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is compatible with [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine){target=\_blank}, [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/kubernetes/){target=\_blank}, and [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/){target=\_blank}.

- **Requirements**: Install [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl){target=\_blank} and ensure proper cluster permissions.
- **Features**: Uses Prometheus operator for monitoring when available.

### Podman

Podman is a daemonless container engine for Linux. Zombienet supports Podman rootless as a provider.

- **Requirements**: Install [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank} on Linux.

- **Features**: Deploys Prometheus, Tempo, and Grafana for monitoring. Services are accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:34123` (Prometheus), `http://127.0.0.1:34125` (Tempo), and `http://127.0.0.1:41461` (Grafana).

### Native

The native provider runs nodes as local processes on your machine.

- **Requirements**: Have the necessary binaries (`polkadot`, `polkadot-parachain`) in your PATH. Install them using:

    ```bash
    zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    For custom binaries, specify the path in your configuration or add them to your PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:INSERT_PATH_TO_BINARY
    ```

- **Features**: No additional monitoring features.

## Configure Zombienet

Zombienet uses JSON or TOML configuration files to define network topology, nodes, and parameters. The [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/tree/main/examples){target=\_blank} provides example configurations.

### Basic Configuration

A minimal configuration includes settings, relay chain configuration, and parachain configuration:

=== "TOML"

    ```toml title="basic-network.toml"
    [settings]
    timeout = 1000

    [relaychain]
    chain = "rococo-local"
    default_command = "polkadot"

        [[relaychain.nodes]]
        name = "alice"
        validator = true

        [[relaychain.nodes]]
        name = "bob"
        validator = true

    [[parachains]]
    id = 1000
    chain = "asset-hub-rococo-local"

        [parachains.collator]
        name = "collator-01"
        command = "polkadot-parachain"
    ```

=== "JSON"

    ```json title="basic-network.json"
    {
      "settings": {
        "timeout": 1000
      },
      "relaychain": {
        "chain": "rococo-local",
        "default_command": "polkadot",
        "nodes": [
          {
            "name": "alice",
            "validator": true
          },
          {
            "name": "bob",
            "validator": true
          }
        ]
      },
      "parachains": [
        {
          "id": 1000,
          "chain": "asset-hub-rococo-local",
          "collator": {
            "name": "collator-01",
            "command": "polkadot-parachain"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### CLI Commands

Zombienet provides the following commands:

- **`spawn <networkConfig>`**: Spawn the network defined in the configuration file.
- **`test <testFile>`**: Run tests on the spawned network.
- **`setup <binaries>`**: Download and set up `polkadot` or `polkadot-parachain` binaries.
- **`convert <filePath>`**: Convert a [polkadot-launch](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch){target=\_blank} configuration to Zombienet format.
- **`version`**: Print Zombienet version.
- **`help`**: Print help information.

Common flags:

- **`-p`, `--provider`**: Override the provider.
- **`-d`, `--dir`**: Specify directory for network files.
- **`-m`, `--monitor`**: Start as monitor without auto cleanup.
- **`-c`, `--spawn-concurrency`**: Number of concurrent spawning processes.

## Spawn a Network

To spawn a network, create a configuration file and run:

```bash
zombienet spawn network.toml --provider native
```

Zombienet will:

1. Download or locate the required binaries.
2. Generate chain specifications.
3. Start relay chain validators.
4. Register and start parachain collators.
5. Display connection endpoints and logs.

Access the running nodes via the provided RPC endpoints (typically `ws://127.0.0.1:9944` for the first node).

## Write Tests

Zombienet provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing tests in `.zndsl` files. Tests can evaluate:

- Metrics from Prometheus
- Log patterns
- System events
- On-chain storage
- Custom JavaScript/TypeScript scripts

### Test File Structure

Test files contain a header and body:

```toml title="example-test.zndsl"
Description: Example test suite
Network: ./network.toml
Creds: config

# Test assertions
alice: is up
bob: is up
alice: parachain 1000 is registered within 200 seconds
alice: parachain 1000 block height is at least 10 within 300 seconds
```

### Run Tests

Execute tests using:

```bash
zombienet test example-test.zndsl --provider native
```

The test runner will execute each assertion and report pass/fail status.

### Common Assertions

Some frequently used assertions include:

- **Well-known functions**: `alice: is up`, `alice: parachain 100 is registered within 225 seconds`
- **Metrics**: `alice: reports node_roles is 4`
- **Logs**: `alice: log line matches glob "Imported #1" within 10 seconds`
- **System events**: `alice: system event matches ""paraId":[0-9]+" within 10 seconds`
- **Custom scripts**: `alice: js-script ./script.js return is greater than 1 within 200 seconds`
