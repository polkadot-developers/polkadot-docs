# Asset Claimer (XCM V4 â†’ XCM V5)

XCMv5 introduces the [`AssetClaimer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v5/enum.Hint.html#variant.AssetClaimer){target=\_blank} execution hint through [`SetHints`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v5/enum.Instruction.html#variant.SetHints){target=\_blank}, which significantly simplifies the process of recovering trapped assets when XCM execution fails.

## The problem before v5

When XCM execution failed and assets became trapped:

- **Governance dependency**: Most trapped asset recovery requires governance proposals.
- **Complex procedures**: Manual intervention through referendum processes.
- **Long delays**: Recovery could take weeks or months through governance.
- **Risk of loss**: Assets could remain permanently trapped if governance didn't act.
- **High barriers**: Small amounts often weren't worth the governance overhead.

## The V5 Solution: `AssetClaimer` Hint

The new [`AssetClaimer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v5/enum.Hint.html#variant.AssetClaimer){target=\_blank} hint allows XCM programs to preemptively designate who can claim trapped assets:

```typescript
// Set asset claimer before risky operations
XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ 
  hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', claimerLocation)] 
})
```

## How it Improves the Situation

The `AssetClaimer` hint transforms the recovery process by allowing proactive designation of claimers, eliminating the need for governance intervention in most cases.

- **Before XCM V5:**

    ```typescript
    // If this XCM fails, assets become trapped
    const riskyXcm = [
        XcmInstruction.WithdrawAsset([assets]),
        XcmInstruction.BuyExecution({ fees, weight_limit }),
        XcmInstruction.Transact({ /* risky call */ }),
        XcmInstruction.DepositAsset({ assets, beneficiary })
    ]

    // Recovery required governance intervention
    ```

- **With XCM V5:**

    ```typescript
    // Proactive asset claimer setup
    const saferXcm = [
        // Anyone can now claim if execution fails
        XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ 
            hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', claimerLocation)] 
        }),
        XcmV5Instruction.WithdrawAsset([assets]),
        XcmV5Instruction.PayFees({ asset }),
        XcmV5Instruction.Transact({ /* risky call */ }),
        XcmV5Instruction.DepositAsset({ assets, beneficiary })
    ]

    // Recovery can be done immediately by the claimer
    ```

## Key Improvements

The `AssetClaimer` hint addresses several critical pain points in trapped asset recovery, transforming the process from governance-dependent to user-controlled.

| Feature | Before XCM V5 | After XCM V5 |
| :-----: | :-----------: | :----------: |
| **Recovery Speed** | Wait for governance process (weeks/months) | Designated claimer can act immediately |
| **Governance Burden** | Every trapped asset requires a governance proposal | Only complex cases need governance intervention |
| **Recovery Predictability** | Uncertain if governance would approve recovery | Predetermined claimer provides certainty |
| **Accessibility** | Small amounts are often not worth governance overhead | Any amount can be efficiently recovered |

## Best Practices

Following these best practices ensures effective use of the `AssetClaimer` hint and maximizes the benefits of automated asset recovery.

### Set Hint Early

Always set the `AssetClaimer` hint before any operations that might fail, ensuring trapped assets can be recovered immediately without governance intervention.

```typescript
// Set claimer hint before any risky operations
XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', claimerLocation)] }),
// ... other instructions that might fail
```

### Use for Cross-Chain Transfers

Particularly useful for setting local accounts on destination chains:

```typescript
// In remote_xcm for cross-chain transfers
const remoteXcm = [
  XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ 
    hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', {
      parents: 0,
      interior: { X1: { AccountId32: { id: localAccountId } } }
    })] 
  }),
  // ... transfer instructions
]
```

### Consider Origin Preservation

When origin preservation is available, trapped assets are automatically associated with the original origin, making claiming easier without additional hints.

## Migration Impact

The introduction of the `AssetClaimer` hint represents a significant improvement in XCM's fault tolerance and user experience, making cross-chain operations safer and more predictable.

This change makes XCM programs more resilient and user-friendly:

- **Reduced risk**: Assets are less likely to be permanently lost.
- **Better UX**: Users can recover their own assets without waiting for governance.
- **Increased adoption**: Lower risk encourages more XCM usage.
- **Operational efficiency**: Reduces governance workload for routine recoveries.
