# XCM Versions

XCM is a versioned language that evolves to meet the growing needs of cross-chain communication in the Polkadot ecosystem. Understanding XCM versioning is essential for developers building interoperable applications to keep up with the latest improvements.

New versions are defined via [Polkadot Fellowship RFCs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/rfcs){target=\_blank}, ensuring each iteration is thoroughly reviewed. This entire documentation uses _XCM V5_ as the primary reference, which is the current stable version.

Each new version introduces new functionality while maintaining backward compatibility where possible. By understanding version differences, you can make informed decisions about which features to use and how to future-proof your applications.
