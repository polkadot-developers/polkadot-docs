# Benchmarking

## Introduction

Benchmarking is a critical component of developing efficient and secure blockchain runtimes. In the Polkadot ecosystem, accurately benchmarking your custom pallets ensures that each extrinsic has a precise [weight](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight){target=\_blank}, representing its computational and storage demands. This process is vital for maintaining the blockchain's performance and preventing potential vulnerabilities, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

The Polkadot SDK leverages the [FRAME](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities){target=\_blank} benchmarking framework, offering tools to measure and assign weights to extrinsics. These weights help determine the maximum number of transactions or system-level calls processed within a block. This guide covers how to use FRAME's [benchmarking framework](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/v2/index.html){target=\_blank}, from setting up your environment to writing and running benchmarks for your custom pallets. You'll understand how to generate accurate weights by the end, ensuring your runtime remains performant and secure.

## The Case for Benchmarking

Benchmarking helps validate that the required execution time for different functions is within reasonable boundaries to ensure your blockchain runtime can handle transactions efficiently and securely. By accurately measuring the weight of each extrinsic, you can prevent service interruptions caused by computationally intensive calls that exceed block time limits. Without benchmarking, runtime performance could be vulnerable to DoS attacks, where malicious users exploit functions with unoptimized weights.

Benchmarking also ensures predictable transaction fees. Weights derived from benchmark tests accurately reflect the resource usage of function calls, allowing fair fee calculation. This approach discourages abuse while maintaining network reliability.

### Benchmarking and Weight 

In Polkadot SDK-based chains, weight quantifies the computational effort needed to process transactions. This weight includes factors such as:

- Computational complexity.
- Storage complexity (proof size).
- Database reads and writes.
- Hardware specifications.

Benchmarking uses real-world testing to simulate worst-case scenarios for extrinsics. The framework generates a linear model for weight calculation by running multiple iterations with varied parameters. These worst-case weights ensure blocks remain within execution limits, enabling the runtime to maintain throughput under varying loads. Excess fees can be refunded if a call uses fewer resources than expected, offering users a fair cost model.
  
Because weight is a generic unit of measurement based on computation time for a specific physical machine, the weight of any function can change based on the specifications of hardware used for benchmarking. By modeling the expected weight of each runtime function, the blockchain can calculate the number of transactions or system-level calls it can execute within a certain period.

Within FRAME, each function call that is dispatched must have a `#[pallet::weight]` annotation that can return the expected weight for the worst-case scenario execution of that function given its inputs:

```rust hl_lines="2"
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::do_something())]
pub fn do_something(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo { Ok(()) }
```

The `WeightInfo` file is automatically generated during benchmarking. Based on these tests, this file provides accurate weights for each extrinsic.

## Benchmarking Process

Benchmarking a pallet involves the following steps: 

1. Creating a `benchmarking.rs` file within your pallet's structure.
2. Writing a benchmarking test for each extrinsic.
3. Executing the benchmarking tool to calculate weights based on performance metrics.

The benchmarking tool runs multiple iterations to model worst-case execution times and determine the appropriate weight. By default, the benchmarking pipeline is deactivated. To activate it, compile your runtime with the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag.

### Prepare Your Environment

Install the [`frame-omni-bencher`](https://crates.io/crates/frame-omni-bencher){target=\_blank} command-line tool:

```bash
cargo install frame-omni-bencher
```

Before writing benchmark tests, you need to ensure the `frame-benchmarking` crate is included in your pallet's `Cargo.toml` similar to the following:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
frame-benchmarking = { version = "37.0.0", default-features = false }
runtime-benchmarks = [
  "frame-benchmarking/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-support/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-system/runtime-benchmarks",
  "sp-runtime/runtime-benchmarks",
]
std = [
  # ...
  "frame-benchmarking?/std",
  # ...
]

```

You must also ensure that you add the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag as follows under the `[features]` section of your pallet's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
runtime-benchmarks = [
  "frame-benchmarking/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-support/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-system/runtime-benchmarks",
  "sp-runtime/runtime-benchmarks",
]
```

Lastly, ensure that `frame-benchmarking` is included in `std = []`: 

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
std = [
  # ...
  "frame-benchmarking?/std",
  # ...
]
```

Once complete, you have the required dependencies for writing benchmark tests for your pallet.

### Write Benchmark Tests

Create a `benchmarking.rs` file in your pallet's `src/`. Your directory structure should look similar to the following:

```
my-pallet/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs          # Main pallet implementation
│   └── benchmarking.rs # Benchmarking
└── Cargo.toml
```

With the directory structure set, you can use the [`polkadot-sdk-parachain-template`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template/tree/master/pallets){target=\_blank} to get started as follows:

```rust title="benchmarking.rs (starter template)"
//! Benchmarking setup for pallet-template
#![cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]

use super::*;
use frame_benchmarking::v2::*;

#[benchmarks]
mod benchmarks {
	use super::*;
	#[cfg(test)]
	use crate::pallet::Pallet as Template;
	use frame_system::RawOrigin;

	#[benchmark]
	fn do_something() {
		let caller: T::AccountId = whitelisted_caller();
		#[extrinsic_call]
		do_something(RawOrigin::Signed(caller), 100);

		assert_eq!(Something::<T>::get().map(|v| v.block_number), Some(100u32.into()));
	}

	#[benchmark]
	fn cause_error() {
		Something::<T>::put(CompositeStruct { block_number: 100u32.into() });
		let caller: T::AccountId = whitelisted_caller();
		#[extrinsic_call]
		cause_error(RawOrigin::Signed(caller));

		assert_eq!(Something::<T>::get().map(|v| v.block_number), Some(101u32.into()));
	}

	impl_benchmark_test_suite!(Template, crate::mock::new_test_ext(), crate::mock::Test);
}
```

In your benchmarking tests, employ these best practices:

- **Write custom testing functions**: The function `do_something` in the preceding example is a placeholder. Similar to writing unit tests, you must write custom functions to benchmark test your extrinsics. Access the mock runtime and use functions such as `whitelisted_caller()` to sign transactions and facilitate testing.
- **Use the `#[extrinsic_call]` macro**: This macro is used when calling the extrinsic itself and is a required part of a benchmarking function. See the [`extrinsic_call`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/v2/index.html#extrinsic_call-and-block){target=\_blank} docs for more details.
- **Validate extrinsic behavior**: The `assert_eq` expression ensures that the extrinsic is working properly within the benchmark context.

Add the `benchmarking` module to your pallet. In the pallet `lib.rs` file add the following:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
mod benchmarking;
```

### Add Benchmarks to Runtime

Before running the benchmarking tool, you must integrate benchmarks with your runtime as follows:

1. Navigate to your `runtime/src` directory and check if a `benchmarks.rs` file exists. If not, create one. This file will contain the macro that registers all pallets for benchmarking along with their respective configurations:

    ```rust title="benchmarks.rs"
    frame_benchmarking::define_benchmarks!(
    [frame_system, SystemBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_parachain_template, TemplatePallet]
    [pallet_balances, Balances]
    [pallet_session, SessionBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_timestamp, Timestamp]
    [pallet_message_queue, MessageQueue]
    [pallet_sudo, Sudo]
    [pallet_collator_selection, CollatorSelection]
    [cumulus_pallet_parachain_system, ParachainSystem]
    [cumulus_pallet_xcmp_queue, XcmpQueue]
);
    ```

    For example, to add a new pallet named `pallet_parachain_template` for benchmarking, include it in the macro as shown:
    ```rust title="benchmarks.rs" hl_lines="3"
    frame_benchmarking::define_benchmarks!(
    [frame_system, SystemBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_parachain_template, TemplatePallet]
    [pallet_balances, Balances]
    [pallet_session, SessionBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_timestamp, Timestamp]
    [pallet_message_queue, MessageQueue]
    [pallet_sudo, Sudo]
    [pallet_collator_selection, CollatorSelection]
    [cumulus_pallet_parachain_system, ParachainSystem]
    [cumulus_pallet_xcmp_queue, XcmpQueue]
);
    );
    ```

    !!!warning "Updating `define_benchmarks!` macro is required"
        Any pallet that needs to be benchmarked must be included in the [`define_benchmarks!`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/macro.define_benchmarks.html){target=\_blank} macro. The CLI will only be able to access and benchmark pallets that are registered here.

2. Check your runtime's `lib.rs` file to ensure the `benchmarks` module is imported. The import should look like this:

    ```rust title="lib.rs"
    #[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
    mod benchmarks;
    ```

    The `runtime-benchmarks` feature gate ensures benchmark tests are isolated from production runtime code.

3. Enable runtime benchmarking for your pallet in `runtime/Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    runtime-benchmarks = [
  # ...
  "pallet_parachain_template/runtime-benchmarks",
]

    ```

### Run Benchmarks

You can now compile your runtime with the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag. This feature flag is crucial as the benchmarking tool will look for this feature being enabled to know when it should run benchmark tests. Follow these steps to compile the runtime with benchmarking enabled:

1. Run `build` with the feature flag included:

    ```bash
    cargo build --features runtime-benchmarks --release
    ```

2. Create a `weights.rs` file in your pallet's `src/` directory. This file will store the auto-generated weight calculations:

    ```bash
    touch weights.rs
    ```

3. Before running the benchmarking tool, you'll need a template file that defines how weight information should be formatted. Download the official template from the Polkadot SDK repository and save it in your project folders for future use:

    ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/refs/tags/polkadot-stable2412/substrate/.maintain/frame-weight-template.hbs \
    --output ./pallets/benchmarking/frame-weight-template.hbs
    ```

4. Run the benchmarking tool to measure extrinsic weights:

    ```bash
    frame-omni-bencher v1 benchmark pallet \
    --runtime INSERT_PATH_TO_WASM_RUNTIME \
    --pallet INSERT_NAME_OF_PALLET \
    --extrinsic "" \
    --template ./frame-weight-template.hbs \
    --output weights.rs
    ```

    !!! tip "Flag definitions"
        - **`--runtime`**: The path to your runtime's Wasm.
        - **`--pallet`**: The name of the pallet you wish to benchmark. This pallet must be configured in your runtime and defined in `define_benchmarks`.
        - **`--extrinsic`**: Which extrinsic to test. Using `""` implies all extrinsics will be benchmarked.
        - **`--template`**: Defines how weight information should be formatted.
        - **`--output`**: Where the output of the auto-generated weights will reside.

The generated `weights.rs` file contains weight annotations for your extrinsics, ready to be added to your pallet. The output should be similar to the following. Some output is omitted for brevity:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>frame-omni-bencher v1 benchmark pallet \</span>
  <span data-ty>--runtime INSERT_PATH_TO_WASM_RUNTIME \</span>
  <span data-ty>--pallet "INSERT_NAME_OF_PALLET" \</span>
  <span data-ty>--extrinsic "" \</span>
  <span data-ty>--template ./frame-weight-template.hbs \</span>
  <span data-ty>--output ./weights.rs</span>
  <span data-ty>...</span>
  <span data-ty>2025-01-15T16:41:33.557045Z INFO polkadot_sdk_frame::benchmark::pallet: [ 0 % ] Starting benchmark: pallet_parachain_template::do_something</span>
  <span data-ty>2025-01-15T16:41:33.564644Z INFO polkadot_sdk_frame::benchmark::pallet: [ 50 % ] Starting benchmark: pallet_parachain_template::cause_error</span>

  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>


#### Add Benchmark Weights to Pallet

Once the `weights.rs` is generated, you must integrate it with your pallet. 

1. To begin the integration, import the `weights` module and the `WeightInfo` trait, then add both to your pallet's `Config` trait. Complete the following steps to set up the configuration:

    ```rust title="lib.rs"
    pub mod weights;
use crate::weights::WeightInfo;

/// Configure the pallet by specifying the parameters and types on which it depends.
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    // ...
    /// A type representing the weights required by the dispatchables of this pallet.
    type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
}
    ```

2. Next, you must add this to the `#[pallet::weight]` annotation in all the extrinsics via the `Config` as follows:

    ```rust hl_lines="2" title="lib.rs"
    #[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::do_something())]
pub fn do_something(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo { Ok(()) }
    ```

3. Finally, configure the actual weight values in your runtime. In `runtime/src/config/mod.rs`, add the following code:

    ```rust title="mod.rs"
    // Configure pallet.
impl pallet_parachain_template::Config for Runtime {
    // ...
    type WeightInfo = pallet_parachain_template::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
}
    ```
