# E2E Testing with Moonwall

## Introduction

Moonwall is an end-to-end testing framework designed explicitly for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. It addresses one of the most significant challenges in blockchain development: managing complex test environments and network configurations.

Moonwall consolidates this complexity by providing the following:

- A centralized configuration management system that explicitly defines all network parameters.
- A standardized approach to environment setup across different Substrate-based chains.
- Built-in utilities for common testing scenarios and network interactions.

Developers can focus on writing meaningful tests rather than managing infrastructure complexities or searching through documentation for configuration options.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank} (version 20.10 or higher).
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}, or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/){target=\_blank}.

## Install Moonwall

Moonwall can be installed globally for system-wide access or locally within specific projects. This section covers both installation methods.

!!! tip
    This documentation corresponds to Moonwall version `5.15.0`. To avoid compatibility issues with the documented features, ensure you're using the matching version.

### Global Installation

Global installation provides system-wide access to the Moonwall CLI, making it ideal for developers working across multiple blockchain projects. Install it by running one of the following commands:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install -g @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm -g install @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn global add @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

Now, you can run the `moonwall` command from your terminal.

### Local Installation

Local installation is recommended for better dependency management and version control within a specific project. First, initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir my-moonwall-project
cd my-moonwall-project
npm init -y
```

Then, install it as a local dependency:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @moonwall/cli@5.15.0
    ```

## Initialize Moonwall

The `moonwall init` command launches an interactive wizard to create your configuration file:

```bash
moonwall init
```

During setup, you will see prompts for the following parameters:

- **`label`**: Identifies your test configuration.
- **`global timeout`**: Maximum time (ms) for test execution.
- **`environment name`**: Name for your testing environment.
- **`network foundation`**: Type of blockchain environment to use.
- **`tests directory`**: Location of your test files.

Select `Enter` to accept defaults or input custom values. You should see something like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>moonwall init</span>
  <span data-ty>‚úî Provide a label for the config file moonwall_config</span>
  <span data-ty>‚úî Provide a global timeout value 30000</span>
  <span data-ty>‚úî Provide a name for this environment default_env</span>
  <span data-ty>‚úî What type of network foundation is this? dev</span>
  <span data-ty>‚úî Provide the path for where tests for this environment are kept tests/</span>
  <span data-ty>? Would you like to generate this config? (no to restart from beginning) (Y/n)</span>
</div>


The wizard generates a `moonwall.config` file:

```json
{
    "label": "moonwall_config",
    "defaultTestTimeout": 30000,
    "environments": [
        {
            "name": "default_env",
            "testFileDir": ["tests/"],
            "foundation": {
                "type": "dev"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The default configuration requires specific details about your blockchain node and test requirements:

- The `foundation` object defines how your test blockchain node will be launched and managed. The dev foundation, which runs a local node binary, is used for local development.

    For more information about available options, check the [Foundations](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/foundations.html){target=\_blank} section.

- The `connections` array specifies how your tests will interact with the blockchain node. This typically includes provider configuration and endpoint details.

    A provider is a tool that allows you or your application to connect to a blockchain network and simplifies the low-level details of the process. A provider handles submitting transactions, reading state, and more. For more information on available providers, check the [Providers supported](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/providers.html#providers-supported){target=\_blank} page in the Moonwall documentation.

Here's a complete configuration example for testing a local node using Polkadot.js as a provider:

```json
{
    "label": "moonwall_config",
    "defaultTestTimeout": 30000,
    "environments": [
        {
            "name": "default_env",
            "testFileDir": ["tests/"],
            "foundation": {
                "launchSpec": [
                    {
                        "binPath": "./node-template",
                        "newRpcBehaviour": true,
                        "ports": { "rpcPort": 9944 }
                    }
                ],
                "type": "dev"
            },
            "connections": [
                {
                    "name": "myconnection",
                    "type": "polkadotJs",
                    "endpoints": ["ws://127.0.0.1:9944"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

## Writing Tests

Moonwall uses the [`describeSuite`](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/moonwall/blob/7568048c52e9f7844f38fb4796ae9e1b9205fdaa/packages/cli/src/lib/runnerContext.ts#L65){target=\_blank} function to define test suites, like using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/){target=\_blank}. Each test suite requires the following:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the suite.
- **`title`**: Descriptive name for the suite.
- **`foundationMethods`**: Specifies the testing environment (e.g., `dev` for local node testing).
- **`testCases`**: A callback function that houses the individual test cases of this suite.

The following example shows how to test a balance transfer between two accounts:

```ts
import '@polkadot/api-augment';
import { describeSuite, expect } from '@moonwall/cli';
import { Keyring } from '@polkadot/api';

describeSuite({
  id: 'D1',
  title: 'Demo suite',
  foundationMethods: 'dev',
  testCases: ({ it, context, log }) => {
    it({
      id: 'T1',
      title: 'Test Case',
      test: async () => {
        // Set up polkadot.js API and testing accounts
        let api = context.polkadotJs();
        let alice = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' }).addFromUri('//Alice');
        let charlie = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' }).addFromUri('//Charlie');

        // Query Charlie's account balance before transfer
        const balanceBefore = (await api.query.system.account(charlie.address))
          .data.free;

        // Before transfer, Charlie's account balance should be 0
        expect(balanceBefore.toString()).toEqual('0');
        log('Balance before: ' + balanceBefore.toString());

        // Transfer from Alice to Charlie
        const amount = 1000000000000000;
        await api.tx.balances
          .transferAllowDeath(charlie.address, amount)
          .signAndSend(alice);

        // Wait for the transaction to be included in a block.
        // This is necessary because the balance is not updated immediately.
        // Block time is 6 seconds.
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 6000));

        // Query Charlie's account balance after transfer
        const balanceAfter = (await api.query.system.account(charlie.address))
          .data.free;

        // After transfer, Charlie's account balance should be 1000000000000000
        expect(balanceAfter.toString()).toEqual(amount.toString());
        log('Balance after: ' + balanceAfter.toString());
      },
    });
  },
});

```

This test demonstrates several key concepts:

- Initializing the Polkadot.js API through Moonwall's context and setting up test accounts.
- Querying on-chain state.
- Executing transactions.
- Waiting for block inclusion.
- Verifying results using assertions.

## Running the Tests

Execute your tests using the `test` Moonwall CLI command. For the default environment setup run:

```bash
moonwall test default_env -c moonwall.config
```

The test runner will output detailed results showing:

- Test suite execution status.
- Individual test case results.
- Execution time.
- Detailed logs and error messages (if any).
