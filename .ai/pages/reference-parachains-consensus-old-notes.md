### Compute Advantage
Below is a table showing the main advantages of asynchronous over synchronous backing.

|                                      | Sync Backing | Async Backing | Async Backing Advantage                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------  | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Parablocks included every**        | 12 seconds   | 6 seconds     | **2x** more parablocks included           |
| **Parablock maximum execution time** | 0.5 seconds  | 2 seconds     | **4x** more execution time in a parablock |
| **Total Computer Gain (per core)**   |              |               | **8x Compute Throughput**                 |
