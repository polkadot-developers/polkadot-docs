## Introduction

Polkadot Hub is the entry point for all users and application developers to Polkadot. It provides access to essential Web3 services, including smart contracts, staking, governance, identity management, and cross-ecosystem interoperability—without requiring you to deploy or manage a parachain.

The Hub encompasses a set of core functionality that enables developers and users to build and interact with applications on Polkadot. This specialized system of parachains and services works together seamlessly to deliver a unified platform experience. The modular approach lets you interact with services optimized for specific use cases, while still benefiting from Polkadot's shared security.

## Polkadot Hub Capabilities

Whether you're just getting started or building complex applications, the Hub supports the ability to:
 
- Hold, send, and receive DOT and other assets across the network.
- Stake DOT to participate in network security and earn rewards.
- Vote in governance referendums and shape Polkadot's future.
- Create both fungible and non-fungible tokens and assets for your projects.
- Pay transaction fees in any asset, not just DOT.
- Register as an individual and establish your on-chain identity.

For more sophisticated development use cases, the Hub enables you to:

- Deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts using Solidity or other EVM languages.
- Build decentralized applications that leverage Polkadot's security and interoperability.
- Create and manage fungible tokens and NFTs with low fees and flexible operations.
- Manage cross-chain interactions through XCM messaging with other parachains.
- Set verified identities and apply for network opportunities like the Ambassador Program.
- Join collectives and participate in governance organizations with specialized roles.

## Core Components

The Polkadot Hub consists of several specialized system parachains and services working together as described in the following sections. 

### Smart Contracts

[Smart Contracts](/reference/polkadot-hub/smart-contracts/){target=\_blank} on Polkadot Hub enable developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts written in Solidity and other familiar EVM languages. Build decentralized applications with full access to Polkadot's security, interoperability, and cross-chain capabilities. Smart contracts on the Hub benefit from lower fees and integration with native Polkadot features, such as identity management and asset operations.

### Asset Management

[Asset Management](/reference/polkadot-hub/assets/){target=\_blank} provides the foundation for on-chain asset management. Create, manage, and transfer fungible tokens and NFTs across the ecosystem. Asset Management offers significantly lower transaction fees—approximately one-tenth the cost of relay chain transactions—and reduced deposit requirements, making it ideal for projects managing digital assets at scale. It also enables payment of transaction fees in non-native assets, providing developers and users with greater flexibility.

### People Chain

[People Chain](/reference/polkadot-hub/people-and-identity/){target=\_blank} powers Polkadot's decentralized identity system. Establish verifiable on-chain identities, control disclosure of personal information, and receive verification from trusted registrars. People Chain enables secure identity management with hierarchical sub-account support, forming the foundation for trusted interactions throughout the ecosystem.

### Bridge Hub

[Bridge Hub](/reference/polkadot-hub/bridging/){target=\_blank} facilitates trustless interactions between Polkadot and external blockchains like Ethereum and Kusama. Through implementations such as Snowbridge, Bridge Hub enables secure cross-chain communication via on-chain light clients and trustless relayers. This component ensures seamless interoperability beyond the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Consensus & Security

[Consensus and Security](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/){target=\_blank} covers the fundamental mechanisms that protect the network. Learn about validator participation, how the relay chain validates all transactions, and the cryptoeconomic incentives that secure Polkadot. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for validators and anyone building critical infrastructure on the network.

### Collectives & DAOs

[Collectives and DAOs](/reference/polkadot-hub/collectives-and-daos/){target=\_blank} enable specialized governance organizations within Polkadot. Participate in collective membership, manage treasury operations, and engage in coordinated decision-making with groups aligned around specific purposes. This functionality supports the creation of autonomous organizations on Polkadot.
