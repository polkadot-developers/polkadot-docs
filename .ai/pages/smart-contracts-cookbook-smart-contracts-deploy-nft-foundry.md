# Deploy an NFT with Foundry

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets commonly used for digital art, collectibles, gaming, and identity verification.

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721){target=\_blank} NFT contract to [Polkadot Hub](/smart-contracts/overview/#smart-contract-development){target=\_blank}. It showcases a secure approach using [OpenZeppelin's battle-tested NFT implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts){target=\_blank} and the [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank} toolchain. Foundry, a fast, Rust-written toolkit, ensures high-performance compilation and is fully compatible with the Hubâ€™s EVM environment via standard Solidity compilation.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Solidity programming and NFT standards
- Test tokens for gas fees (available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank})
- A wallet with a private key for signing transactions

## Set Up Your Project

To get started, take the following steps:

1. Install Foundry:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    foundryup
    ```

2. Initialize your project:

    ```bash
    forge init foundry-nft-deployment
    cd foundry-nft-deployment
    ```

3. Install OpenZeppelin contracts:

    ```bash
    forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
    ```

## Configure Foundry

Edit `foundry.toml`:

```toml title="foundry.toml"
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
remappings = ['@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/']

[rpc_endpoints]
polkadot_hub_testnet = "https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io"
```

## Create Your Contract

Create `src/MyNFT.sol`:

```solidity title="src/MyNFT.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 private _nextTokenId;

    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC721("MyToken", "MTK")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
    {}

    function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

## Compile

```bash
forge build
```

Verify the compilation by inspecting the bytecode:

```bash
forge inspect MyNFT bytecode
```

## Deploy

Deploy to Polkadot Hub TestNet:

```bash
forge create MyNFT \
    --rpc-url polkadot_hub_testnet \
    --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --constructor-args YOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS \
    --broadcast
```

Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key and `YOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS` with the address that will own the NFT contract.
