# Block Explorers

## Introduction

Block explorers serve as comprehensive blockchain analytics platforms that provide access to on-chain data. These web applications function as search engines for blockchain networks, allowing users to query, visualize, and analyze blockchain data in real time through intuitive interfaces.

## Core Functionality

These block explorers provide essential capabilities for interacting with smart contracts in Polkadot Hub:

- **Transaction tracking**: Monitor transaction status, confirmations, fees, and metadata.
- **Address analysis**: View account balances, transaction history, and associated contracts.
- **Block information**: Examine block contents.
- **Smart contract interaction**: Review contract code, verification status, and interaction history.
- **Token tracking**: Monitor ERC-20, ERC-721, and other token standards with transfer history and holder analytics.
- **Network statistics**: Access metrics on transaction volume, gas usage, and other network parameters.

## Available Block Explorers

The following block explorers are available for PVM smart contracts, providing specialized tools for monitoring and analyzing contract activity within the Polkadot ecosystem.



### BlockScout

BlockScout is an open-source explorer platform with a user-friendly interface adapted for PVM contracts. It excels at detailed contract analytics and provides developers with comprehensive API access.
