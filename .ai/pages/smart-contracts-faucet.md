# Faucet

Test tokens allow you to experiment with smart contracts, test transactions, and validate your dApp functionality without using real cryptocurrency. 

Polkadot has a faucet that distributes free TestNet tokens to developers for testing purposes:

- Execute transactions on TestNet networks.
- Pay for gas fees when deploying smart contracts.
- Test dApp functionality before MainNet deployment.
- Experiment with blockchain interactions without financial risk.


## Get Test Tokens

For Polkadot Hub TestNet, you can use the [Polkadot Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111){target=\_blank} to obtain test tokens. Here's how to do it:

1. Navigate to the [Polkadot Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111){target=\_blank}. If the desired network is not already selected, choose it from the **Network** drop-down. This example uses the Polkadot Hub TestNet.
2. Copy your address linked to the TestNet and paste it into the designated field.
3. Click the **Get Some PASs** button to request free test PAS tokens. These tokens will be sent to your wallet shortly.

## Things to Consider

!!! info "Rate Limiting"
    Faucets typically implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. You may need to wait between requests if you've recently obtained tokens from the same faucet.

!!! warning "Network Compatibility"
    Ensure your wallet is connected to the correct network (Polkadot Hub TestNet) before requesting tokens. Tokens sent to addresses on different networks will not be accessible.

## Using Your Test Tokens

Getting started with test tokens is the first step in your Polkadot development journey. These free resources enable you to build, experiment with, and refine your applications without financial constraints, ensuring your projects are robust and ready for deployment on MainNet.
