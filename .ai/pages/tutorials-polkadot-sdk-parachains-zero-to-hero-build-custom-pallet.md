# Build a Custom Pallet

## Introduction

In Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, runtime functionality is built through modular components called [pallets](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#pallet){target=\_blank}. These pallets are Rust-based runtime modules created using [FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modular Entities)](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/overview/){target=\_blank}, a powerful library that simplifies blockchain development by providing specialized macros and standardized patterns for building blockchain logic.
A pallet encapsulates a specific set of blockchain functionalities, such as managing token balances, implementing governance mechanisms, or creating custom state transitions.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a custom pallet from scratch. You will develop a simple counter pallet with the following features:

- Users can increment and decrement a counter.
- Only a [root origin](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/type.Origin.html#variant.Root){target=\_blank} can set an arbitrary counter value.

## Prerequisites

You'll use the [Polkadot SDK Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/parachain){target=\_blank} created in the [Set Up a Template](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/set-up-a-template/){target=\_blank} tutorial. 

## Create a New Project

In this tutorial, you'll build a custom pallet from scratch to demonstrate the complete workflow, rather than starting with the pre-built `pallet-template`. The first step is to create a new Rust package for your pallet:

1. Navigate to the `pallets` directory in your workspace:

    ```bash
    cd pallets
    ```

2. Create a new Rust library project for your custom pallet by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo new --lib custom-pallet
    ```

3. Enter the new project directory:

    ```bash
    cd custom-pallet
    ```

4. Ensure the project was created successfully by checking its structure. The file layout should resemble the following:

    ```
    custom-pallet 
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── lib.rs
    ```

    If the files are in place, your project setup is complete, and you're ready to start building your custom pallet.

## Add Dependencies

To build and integrate your custom pallet into a Polkadot SDK-based runtime, you must add specific dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file of your pallet's project. These dependencies provide essential modules and features required for pallet development. Since your custom pallet is part of a workspace that includes other components, such as the runtime, the configuration must align with the workspace structure. Follow the steps below to set up your `Cargo.toml` file properly:

1. Open your `Cargo.toml` file.

2. Add the required dependencies in the `[dependencies]` section:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
codec = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
scale-info = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
frame = { features = ["experimental", "runtime"], workspace = true }
    ```

3. Enable `std` features:

    ```toml
    [features]
default = ["std"]
std = ["codec/std", "frame/std", "scale-info/std"]
    ```

The final `Cargo.toml` file should resemble the following:

??? code "Cargo.toml"

    ```toml
    [package]
name = "custom-pallet"
version = "0.1.0"
license.workspace = true
authors.workspace = true
homepage.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true

[dependencies]
codec = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
scale-info = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
frame = { features = ["experimental", "runtime"], workspace = true }

[features]
default = ["std"]
std = ["codec/std", "frame/std", "scale-info/std"]
runtime-benchmarks = ["frame/runtime-benchmarks"]

    ```

## Implement the Pallet Logic

In this section, you will construct the core structure of your custom pallet, starting with setting up its basic scaffold. This scaffold acts as the foundation, enabling you to later add functionality such as storage items, events, errors, and dispatchable calls.

### Add Scaffold Pallet Structure

You now have the bare minimum of package dependencies that your pallet requires specified in the `Cargo.toml` file. The next step is to prepare the scaffolding for your new pallet.

1. Open `src/lib.rs` in a text editor and delete all the content.
   
2. Prepare the scaffolding for the pallet by adding the following:

    ```rust title="lib.rs"
    #![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

pub use pallet::*;

    #[frame::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
    use super::*;
    use frame::prelude::*;
    #[pallet::pallet]
    pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

    // Configuration trait for the pallet.
    #[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        // Defines the event type for the pallet.
            }
    }
    ```

3. Verify that it compiles by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo build --package custom-pallet
    ```

### Pallet Configuration

Implementing the `#[pallet::config]` macro is mandatory and sets the module's dependency on other modules and the types and values specified by the runtime-specific settings.

In this step, you will configure two essential components that are critical for the pallet's functionality:

- **`RuntimeEvent`**: Since this pallet emits events, the [`RuntimeEvent`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.RuntimeEvent){target=\_blank} type is required to handle them. This ensures that events generated by the pallet can be correctly processed and interpreted by the runtime.

- **`CounterMaxValue`**: A constant that sets an upper limit on the value of the counter, ensuring that the counter remains within a predefined range.

Add the following `Config` trait definition to your pallet:

```rust title="lib.rs"
    #[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        // Defines the event type for the pallet.
        type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

        // Defines the maximum value the counter can hold.
        #[pallet::constant]
        type CounterMaxValue: Get<u32>;
    }
```

### Add Events

Events allow the pallet to communicate with the outside world by emitting signals when specific actions occur. These events are critical for transparency, debugging, and integration with external systems such as UIs or monitoring tools.

Below are the events defined for this pallet:

- **`CounterValueSet`**: Is emitted when the counter is explicitly set to a new value. This event includes the counter's updated value.

- **`CounterIncremented`**: Is emitted after a successful increment operation. It includes.

    - The new counter value.
    - The account responsible for the increment.
    - The amount by which the counter was incremented.

- **`CounterDecremented`**: Is emitted after a successful decrement operation. It includes.

    - The new counter value.
    - The account responsible for the decrement.
    - The amount by which the counter was decremented.

Define the events in the pallet as follows:

```rust title="lib.rs"
    #[pallet::event]
    #[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
    pub enum Event<T: Config> {
        /// The counter value has been set to a new value by Root.
        CounterValueSet {
            /// The new value set.
            counter_value: u32,
        },
        /// A user has successfully incremented the counter.
        CounterIncremented {
            /// The new value set.
            counter_value: u32,
            /// The account who incremented the counter.
            who: T::AccountId,
            /// The amount by which the counter was incremented.
            incremented_amount: u32,
        },
        /// A user has successfully decremented the counter.
        CounterDecremented {
            /// The new value set.
            counter_value: u32,
            /// The account who decremented the counter.
            who: T::AccountId,
            /// The amount by which the counter was decremented.
            decremented_amount: u32,
        },
    }

```

### Add Storage Items

Storage items are used to manage the pallet's state. This pallet defines two items to handle the counter's state and user interactions:

- **`CounterValue`**: A single storage value that keeps track of the current value of the counter. This value is the core state variable manipulated by the pallet's functions.

- **`UserInteractions`**: A storage map that tracks the number of times each account interacts with the counter.
  
Define the storage items as follows:

```rust title="lib.rs"
    #[pallet::storage]
    pub type CounterValue<T> = StorageValue<_, u32>;

    /// Storage map to track the number of interactions performed by each account.
    #[pallet::storage]
    pub type UserInteractions<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Twox64Concat, T::AccountId, u32>;

```

### Implement Custom Errors

The `#[pallet::error]` macro defines a custom `Error` enum to handle specific failure conditions within the pallet. Errors help provide meaningful feedback to users and external systems when an extrinsic cannot be completed successfully. They are critical for maintaining the pallet's clarity and robustness.

To add custom errors, use the `#[pallet::error]` macro to define the `Error` enum. Each variant represents a unique error that the pallet can emit, and these errors should align with the logic and constraints of the pallet. 

Add the following errors to the pallet:

```rust title="lib.rs"
    #[pallet::error]
    pub enum Error<T> {
        /// The counter value exceeds the maximum allowed value.
        CounterValueExceedsMax,
        /// The counter value cannot be decremented below zero.
        CounterValueBelowZero,
        /// Overflow occurred in the counter.
        CounterOverflow,
        /// Overflow occurred in user interactions.
        UserInteractionOverflow,
    }

```

### Implement Calls

The `#[pallet::call]` macro defines the dispatchable functions (or calls) the pallet exposes. These functions allow users or the runtime to interact with the pallet's logic and state. Each call includes comprehensive validations, modifies the state, and optionally emits events to signal successful execution.

The structure of the dispatchable calls in this pallet is as follows:

```rust title="lib.rs"
    #[pallet::call]
    impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
        /// Set the value of the counter.
        ///
        /// The dispatch origin of this call must be _Root_.
        ///
        /// - `new_value`: The new value to set for the counter.
        ///
        /// Emits `CounterValueSet` event when successful.
        #[pallet::call_index(0)]
    #[pallet::weight(0)]
            pub fn set_counter_value(origin: OriginFor<T>, new_value: u32) -> DispatchResult {
            }

            /// Increment the counter by a specified amount.
        ///
        /// This function can be called by any signed account.
        ///
        /// - `amount_to_increment`: The amount by which to increment the counter.
        ///
        /// Emits `CounterIncremented` event when successful.
        #[pallet::call_index(1)]
    #[pallet::weight(0)]
            pub fn increment(origin: OriginFor<T>, amount_to_increment: u32) -> DispatchResult {
            }

            /// Decrement the counter by a specified amount.
        ///
        /// This function can be called by any signed account.
        ///
        /// - `amount_to_decrement`: The amount by which to decrement the counter.
        ///
        /// Emits `CounterDecremented` event when successful.
        #[pallet::call_index(2)]
    #[pallet::weight(0)]
            pub fn decrement(origin: OriginFor<T>, amount_to_decrement: u32) -> DispatchResult {
        }
}
```

Expand the following items to view the implementations of each dispatchable call in this pallet.

???- code "set_counter_value(origin: OriginFor<T>, new_value: u32) -> DispatchResult"

        - Prevents underflow during the subtraction.
        - Ensures the counter does not drop below zero.
    - Behavior:
        - Updates the `CounterValue` storage item.
        - Tracks the number of interactions by the user in the `UserInteractions` storage map.
        - Emits a `CounterDecremented` event on success.

            });

            Ok(())
        }
    ```

## Verify Compilation

After implementing all the pallet components, verifying that the code still compiles successfully is crucial. Run the following command in your terminal to ensure there are no errors:

```bash
cargo build --package custom-pallet
```

If you encounter any errors or warnings, carefully review your code to resolve the issues. Once the build is complete without errors, your pallet implementation is ready.

## Key Takeaways

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a custom pallet by defining storage, implementing errors, adding dispatchable calls, and emitting events. These are the foundational building blocks for developing robust Polkadot SDK-based blockchain logic.
