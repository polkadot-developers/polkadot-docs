# Accounts on Asset Hub Smart Contracts

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Asset Hub natively utilizes Polkadot's 32-byte account system while providing interoperability with Ethereum's 20-byte addresses through an automatic conversion system. When interacting with smart contracts:

- Ethereum-compatible wallets (like MetaMask) can use their familiar 20-byte addresses.
- Polkadot accounts continue using their native 32-byte format.
- The Asset Hub chain automatically handles conversion between the two formats behind the scenes:

    - 20-byte Ethereum addresses are padded with `0xEE` bytes to create valid 32-byte Polkadot accounts.
    - 32-byte Polkadot accounts can optionally register a mapping to a 20-byte address for Ethereum compatibility.

This dual-format approach enables Asset Hub to maintain compatibility with Ethereum tooling while fully integrating with the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Address Types and Mappings

The platform handles two distinct address formats:

- [Ethereum-style addresses (20 bytes)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#account-creation){target=\_blank}
- [Polkadot native account IDs (32 bytes)](/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/accounts/){target=\_blank}

### Ethereum to Polkadot Mapping

The [`AccountId32Mapper`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/struct.AccountId32Mapper.html){target=\_blank} implementation in [`pallet_revive`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} handles the core address conversion logic. For converting a 20-byte Ethereum address to a 32-byte Polkadot address, the pallet uses a simple concatenation approach:

- [**Core mechanism**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_fallback_account_id){target=\_blank}: Takes a 20-byte Ethereum address and extends it to 32 bytes by adding twelve `0xEE` bytes at the end. The key benefits of this approach are:
    - Able to fully revert, allowing a smooth transition back to the Ethereum format.
    - Provides clear identification of Ethereum-controlled accounts through the `0xEE` suffix pattern.
    - Maintains cryptographic security with a `2^96` difficulty for pattern reproduction.

### Polkadot to Ethereum Mapping

The conversion from 32-byte Polkadot accounts to 20-byte Ethereum addresses is more complex than the reverse direction due to the lossy nature of the conversion. The [`AccountId32Mapper`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/struct.AccountId32Mapper.html){target=\_blank} handles this through two distinct approaches:

- **For Ethereum-derived accounts**: The system uses the [`is_eth_derived`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/fn.is_eth_derived.html){target=\_blank} function to detect accounts that were originally Ethereum addresses (identified by the `0xEE` suffix pattern). For these accounts, the conversion strips the last 12 bytes to recover the original 20-byte Ethereum address.

- **For native Polkadot accounts**: Since these accounts utilize the whole 32-byte space and weren't derived from Ethereum addresses, direct truncation would result in lost information. Instead, the system:

    1. Hashes the entire 32-byte account using Keccak-256.
    2. Takes the last 20 bytes of the hash to create the Ethereum address.
    3. This ensures a deterministic mapping while avoiding simple truncation.

The conversion process is implemented through the [`to_address`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_address){target=\_blank} function, which automatically detects the account type and applies the appropriate conversion method.

**Stateful Mapping for Reversibility** : Since the conversion from 32-byte to 20-byte addresses is inherently lossy, the system provides an optional stateful mapping through the [`OriginalAccount`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/storage_types/struct.OriginalAccount.html){target=\_blank} storage. When a Polkadot account registers a mapping (via the [`map`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.map){target=\_blank} function), the system stores the original 32-byte account ID, enabling the [`to_account_id`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_account_id){target=\_blank} function to recover the exact original account rather than falling back to a default conversion.


### Account Mapping for Native Polkadot Accounts

If you have a native Polkadot account (32-byte format) that was created with a Polkadot/Substrate keypair (Ed25519/Sr25519) rather than an Ethereum-compatible keypair (secp256k1), you'll need to map your account to enable Ethereum compatibility.

To map your account, call the [`map_account`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/dispatchables/fn.map_account.html){target=\_blank} extrinsic of the [`pallet_revive`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet using your original Substrate account. This creates a stateful mapping that allows your 32-byte account to interact with the Ethereum-compatible smart contract system.

Once mapped, you'll be able to:

- Transfer funds between 20-byte format addresses.
- Interact with smart contracts using Ethereum-compatible tools like MetaMask.
- Maintain full reversibility to your original 32-byte account format.

!!! warning "Mapping Requirement"
    Without this mapping, native Polkadot accounts cannot transfer funds or interact with the Ethereum-compatible layer on the Hub.

## Account Registration

The registration process is implemented through the [`map`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.map){target=\_blank} function. This process involves:

- Checking if the account is already mapped.
- Calculating and collecting required deposits based on data size.
- Storing the address suffix for future reference.
- Managing the currency holds for security.

## Fallback Accounts

The fallback mechanism is integrated into the [`to_account_id`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_account_id){target=\_blank} function. It provides a safety net for address conversion by:

- First, attempting to retrieve stored mapping data.
- Falling back to the default conversion method if no mapping exists.
- Maintaining consistency in address representation.

## Contract Address Generation

The system supports two methods for generating contract addresses:

- [CREATE1 method](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/fn.create1.html){target=\_blank}:

    - Uses the deployer address and nonce.
    - Generates deterministic addresses for standard contract deployment.

- [CREATE2 method](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/fn.create2.html){target=\_blank}:

    - Uses the deployer address, initialization code, input data, and salt.
    - Enables predictable address generation for advanced use cases.

## Security Considerations

The address mapping system maintains security through several design choices evident in the implementation:

- The stateless mapping requires no privileged operations, as shown in the [`to_fallback_account_id`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/trait.AddressMapper.html#tymethod.to_fallback_account_id){target=\_blank} implementation.
- The stateful mapping requires a deposit managed through the [`Currency`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.Currency){target=\_blank} trait.
- Mapping operations are protected against common errors through explicit checks.
- The system prevents double-mapping through the [`ensure!(!Self::is_mapped(account_id))`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/stable2412/substrate/frame/revive/src/address.rs#L125){target=\_blank} check.

All source code references are from the [`address.rs`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/stable2412/substrate/frame/revive/src/address.rs){target=\_blank} file in the Revive pallet of the Polkadot SDK repository.

# Create a Smart Contract

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Creating [smart contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/overview/){target=\_blank} is fundamental to blockchain development. While many frameworks and tools are available, understanding how to write a contract from scratch with just a text editor is essential knowledge.

This tutorial will guide you through creating a basic smart contract that can be used with other tutorials for deployment and integration on Polkadot Hub. To understand how smart contracts work in Polkadot Hub, check the [Smart Contract Basics](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/){target=\_blank} guide for more information.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A text editor of your choice ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=\_blank}, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/){target=\_blank}, etc.).
- Basic understanding of programming concepts.
- Familiarity with the Solidity programming language syntax. For further references, check the official [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/){target=\_blank}.

## Understanding Smart Contract Structure

Let's explore these components before building the contract:

- **[SPDX license identifier](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.8/layout-of-source-files.html){target=\_blank}**: A standardized way to declare the license under which your code is released. This helps with legal compliance and is required by the Solidity compiler to avoid warnings.
- **Pragma directive**: Specifies which version of Solidity compiler should be used for your contract.
- **Contract declaration**: Similar to a class in object-oriented programming, it defines the boundaries of your smart contract.
- **State variables**: Data stored directly in the contract that persists between function calls. These represent the contract's "state" on the blockchain.
- **Functions**: Executable code that can read or modify the contract's state variables.
- **Events**: Notification mechanisms that applications can subscribe to in order to track blockchain changes.

## Create the Smart Contract

In this section, you'll build a simple storage contract step by step. This basic Storage contract is a great starting point for beginners. It introduces key concepts like state variables, functions, and events in a simple way, demonstrating how data is stored and updated on the blockchain. Later, you'll explore each component in more detail to understand what's happening behind the scenes.

This contract will:

- Store a number.
- Allow updating the stored number.
- Emit an event when the number changes.

To build the smart contract, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new file named `Storage.sol`.

2. Add the SPDX license identifier at the top of the file:

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    ```

    This line tells users and tools which license governs your code. The [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit){target=\_blank} is commonly used for open-source projects. The Solidity compiler requires this line to avoid licensing-related warnings.

3. Specify the Solidity version:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.28;
    ```

    The caret `^` means "this version or any compatible newer version." This helps ensure your contract compiles correctly with the intended compiler features.

4. Create the contract structure:

    ```solidity
    contract Storage {
        // Contract code will go here
    }
    ```

    This defines a contract named "Storage", similar to how you would define a class in other programming languages.

5. Add the state variables and event:

    ```solidity
    contract Storage {
        // State variable to store a number
        uint256 private number;
        
        // Event to notify when the number changes
        event NumberChanged(uint256 newNumber);
    }
    ```

    Here, you're defining:

    - A state variable named `number` of type `uint256` (unsigned integer with 256 bits), which is marked as `private` so it can only be accessed via functions within this contract.
    - An event named `NumberChanged` that will be triggered whenever the number changes. The event includes the new value as data.

6. Add the getter and setter functions:

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

    contract Storage {
        // State variable to store our number
        uint256 private number;

        // Event to notify when the number changes
        event NumberChanged(uint256 newNumber);

        // Function to store a new number
        function store(uint256 newNumber) public {
            number = newNumber;
            emit NumberChanged(newNumber);
        }

        // Function to retrieve the stored number
        function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
            return number;
        }
    }
    ```

??? code "Complete Storage.sol contract"

    ```solidity title="Storage.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

    contract Storage {
        // State variable to store our number
        uint256 private number;

        // Event to notify when the number changes
        event NumberChanged(uint256 newNumber);

        // Function to store a new number
        function store(uint256 newNumber) public {
            number = newNumber;
            emit NumberChanged(newNumber);
        }

        // Function to retrieve the stored number
        function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
            return number;
        }
    }
    ```

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down the key components of the contract:

- **State Variable**

    - **`uint256 private number`**: A private variable that can only be accessed through the contract's functions.
    - The `private` keyword prevents direct access from other contracts, but it's important to note that while other contracts cannot read this variable directly, the data itself is still visible on the blockchain and can be read by external tools or applications that interact with the blockchain. "Private" in Solidity doesn't mean the data is encrypted or truly hidden.
    - State variables in Solidity are permanent storage on the blockchain, making them different from variables in traditional programming. Every change to a state variable requires a transaction and costs gas (the fee paid for blockchain operations).

- **Event**

    - **`event NumberChanged(uint256 newNumber)`**: Emitted when the stored number changes.
    - When triggered, events write data to the blockchain's log, which can be efficiently queried by applications.
    - Unlike state variables, events cannot be read by smart contracts, only by external applications.
    - Events are much more gas-efficient than storing data when you only need to notify external systems of changes.

- **Functions**

    - **`store(uint256 newNumber)`**: Updates the stored number and emits an event.
        - This function changes the state of the contract and requires a transaction to execute.
        - The `emit` keyword is used to trigger the defined event.

    - **`retrieve()`**: Returns the current stored number.
        - The `view` keyword indicates that this function only reads data and doesn't modify the contract's state.
        - View functions don't require a transaction and don't cost gas when called externally.

    For those new to Solidity, this naming pattern (getter/setter functions) is a common design pattern. Instead of directly accessing state variables, the convention is to use functions to control access and add additional logic if needed.

This basic contract serves as a foundation for learning smart contract development. Real-world contracts often require additional security considerations, more complex logic, and thorough testing before deployment.

For more detailed information about Solidity types, functions, and best practices, refer to the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/){target=\_blank} or this [beginner's guide to Solidity](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/index.htm){target=\_blank}.

Page Title: Deploy an ERC-20 to Polkadot Hub

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/tutorials-smart-contracts-deploy-erc20.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/
- Summary: Deploy an ERC-20 token on Polkadot Hub using PolkaVM. This guide covers contract creation, compilation, deployment, and interaction via Polkadot Remix IDE.

# Deploy an ERC-20 to Polkadot Hub

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank} tokens are fungible tokens commonly used for creating cryptocurrencies, governance tokens, and staking mechanisms. Polkadot Hub enables easy token deployment with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via PolkaVM.

This tutorial covers deploying an ERC-20 contract on the Polkadot Hub TestNet using [Polkadot Remix IDE](https://remix.polkadot.io){target=\_blank}, a web-based development tool. [OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.4.0/contracts/token/ERC20){target=\_blank} are used for security and compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank} installed and connected to Polkadot Hub. For detailed instructions, see the [Connect Your Wallet](/develop/smart-contracts/wallets){target=\_blank} section.
- A funded account with some PAS tokens (you can get them from the [Polkadot Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111){target=\_blank}). To learn how to get test tokens, check out the [Test Tokens](/develop/smart-contracts/connect-to-polkadot#test-tokens){target=\_blank} section.
- Basic understanding of Solidity and fungible tokens.

## Create the ERC-20 Contract

To create the ERC-20 contract, you can follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the [Polkadot Remix IDE](https://remix.polkadot.io){target=\_blank}.
2. Click in the **Create new file** button under the **contracts** folder, and name your contract as `MyToken.sol`.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/deploy-erc20-1.webp)

3. Now, paste the following ERC-20 contract code into the editor:

    ```solidity title="MyToken.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    // Compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts ^5.0.0
    pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

    import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
    import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract MyToken is ERC20, Ownable {
        constructor(address initialOwner)
            ERC20("MyToken", "MTK")
            Ownable(initialOwner)
        {}

        function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
            _mint(to, amount);
        }
    }
    ```

    The key components of the code above are:

    - Contract imports:

        - **[`ERC20.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.4.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank}**: The base contract for fungible tokens, implementing core functionality like transfers, approvals, and balance tracking.
        - **[`Ownable.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.4.0/contracts/access/Ownable.sol){target=\_blank}**: Provides basic authorization control, ensuring only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
    
    - Constructor parameters:

        - **`initialOwner`**: Sets the address that will have administrative rights over the contract.
        - **`"MyToken"`**: The full name of your token.
        - **`"MTK"`**: The symbol representing your token in wallets and exchanges.

    - Key functions:

        - **`mint(address to, uint256 amount)`**: Allows the contract owner to create new tokens for any address. The amount should include 18 decimals (e.g., 1 token = 1000000000000000000).
        - Inherited [Standard ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/){target=\_blank} functions:
            - **`transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`**: Sends a specified amount of tokens to another address.
            - **`approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`**: Grants permission for another address to spend a specific number of tokens on behalf of the token owner.
            - **`transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`**: Transfers tokens from one address to another, if previously approved.
            - **`balanceOf(address account)`**: Returns the token balance of a specific address.
            - **`allowance(address owner, address spender)`**: Checks how many tokens an address is allowed to spend on behalf of another address.

    !!! tip
        Use the [OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/){target=\_blank} to quickly generate customized smart contracts. Simply configure your contract, copy the generated code, and paste it into Polkadot Remix IDE for deployment. Below is an example of an ERC-20 token contract created with it:

        ![Screenshot of the OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard showing an ERC-20 contract configuration.](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/deploy-erc20-2.webp)
        

## Compile the Contract

The compilation transforms your Solidity source code into bytecode that can be deployed on the blockchain. During this process, the compiler checks your contract for syntax errors, ensures type safety, and generates the machine-readable instructions needed for blockchain execution. To compile your contract, follow the instructions below:

1. Select the **Solidity Compiler** plugin from the left panel.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/deploy-erc20-3.webp)

2. Click the **Compile MyToken.sol** button.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/deploy-erc20-4.webp)

3. If the compilation succeeded, you'll see a green checkmark indicating success in the **Solidity Compiler** icon.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/deploy-erc20-5.webp)

## Deploy the Contract

Deployment is the process of publishing your compiled smart contract to the blockchain, making it permanently available for interaction. During deployment, you'll create a new instance of your contract on the blockchain, which involves:

1. Select the **Deploy & Run Transactions** plugin from the left panel.

    If the transaction succeeds, you will see the following output in the terminal:

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/deploy-erc20-14.webp)

Other common functions you can use:

- **`balanceOf(address)`**: Check token balance of any address.
- **`transfer(address to, uint256 amount)`**: Send tokens to another address.
- **`approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`**: Allow another address to spend your tokens.

Feel free to explore and interact with the contract's other functions using the same approach - selecting the method, providing any required parameters, and confirming the transaction through Talisman when needed.

# Deploy an NFT to Polkadot Hub

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets commonly used for digital art, collectibles, gaming, and identity verification. Polkadot Hub supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts through PolkaVM, enabling straightforward NFT deployment.

This tutorial guides you through deploying an [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721){target=\_blank} NFT contract on the Polkadot Hub TestNet using the [Polkadot Remix IDE](https://remix.polkadot.io){target=\_blank}, a web-based development environment. To ensure security and standard compliance, it uses [OpenZeppelin's NFT contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.4.0){target=\_blank} implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/){target=\_blank} installed and connected to the Polkadot Hub TestNet. Check the [Connect to Polkadot](/develop/smart-contracts/connect-to-polkadot/){target=\_blank} guide for more information.
- A funded account with some PAS tokens (you can get them from the [Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111){target=\_blank}, noting that the faucet imposes a daily token limit, which may require multiple requests to obtain sufficient funds for testing).
- Basic understanding of Solidity and NFTs, see the [Solidity Basics](https://soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} and the [NFT Overview](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/){target=\_blank} guides for more details.

## Create the NFT Contract

To create the NFT contract, you can follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the [Polkadot Remix IDE](https://remix.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}.
2. Click in the **Create new file** button under the **contracts** folder, and name your contract as `MyNFT.sol`.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-1.webp)

3. Now, paste the following NFT contract code into the editor.

    ```solidity title="MyNFT.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    // Compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts ^5.0.0
    pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

    import {ERC721} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
    import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract MyToken is ERC721, Ownable {
        uint256 private _nextTokenId;

        constructor(address initialOwner)
            ERC721("MyToken", "MTK")
            Ownable(initialOwner)
        {}

        function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner {
            uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
            _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        }
    }
    ```

    The key components of the code above are:

    - Contract imports:

        - **[`ERC721.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol){target=\_blank}**: The base contract for non-fungible tokens, implementing core NFT functionality like transfers and approvals.
        - **[`Ownable.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/access/Ownable.sol){target=\_blank}**: Provides basic authorization control, ensuring only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
    
    - Constructor parameters:

        - **`initialOwner`**: Sets the address that will have administrative rights over the contract.
        - **`"MyToken"`**: The full name of your NFT collection.
        - **`"MTK"`**: The symbol representing your token in wallets and marketplaces.

    - Key functions:

        - **[`_safeMint(to, tokenId)`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L304){target=\_blank}**: An internal function from `ERC721` that safely mints new tokens. It includes checks to ensure the recipient can handle `ERC721` tokens, with the `_nextTokenId` mechanism automatically generating unique sequential token IDs and the `onlyOwner` modifier restricting minting rights to the contract owner.
        - Inherited [Standard ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/){target=\_blank} functions provide a standardized set of methods that enable interoperability across different platforms, wallets, and marketplaces, ensuring that your NFT can be easily transferred, traded, and managed by any system that supports the `ERC721` standard:
            - **`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Transfers a specific NFT from one address to another.
            - **`safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Safely transfers an NFT, including additional checks to prevent loss.
            - **`approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Grants permission for another address to transfer a specific NFT.
            - **`setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`**: Allows an address to manage all of the owner's NFTs.
            - **`balanceOf(address owner)`**: Returns the number of NFTs owned by a specific address.
            - **`ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`**: Returns the current owner of a specific NFT.

    !!! tip
        Use the [OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/){target=\_blank} to generate customized smart contracts quickly. Simply configure your contract, copy the generated code, and paste it into Polkadot Remix IDE for deployment. Below is an example of an ERC-721 token contract created with it:

        ![Screenshot of the OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard showing an ERC-721 contract configuration.](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-2.webp)


## Compile the Contract

Compilation is a stage that converts your Solidity source code into bytecode suitable for deployment on the blockchain. Throughout this process, the compiler examines your contract for syntax errors, verifies type safety, and produces machine-readable instructions for execution on the blockchain.

1. Select the **Solidity Compiler** plugin from the left panel.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-3.webp)

2. Click in the **Compile MyNFT.sol** button.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-4.webp)

3. If the compilation succeeded, you can see a green checkmark indicating success in the **Solidity Compiler** icon.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-5.webp)

## Deploy the Contract

Deployment is the process of uploading your compiled smart contract to the blockchain, allowing for interaction. During deployment, you will instantiate your contract on the blockchain, which involves:

1. Select the **Deploy & Run Transactions** plugin from the left panel.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-6.webp)

2. Configure the deployment settings:

    1. From the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown, select **Injected Provider - Talisman** (check the [Deploying Contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix/#deploying-contracts){target=\_blank} section of the Remix IDE guide for more details).
    2. From the **ACCOUNT** dropdown, select the account you want to use for the deploy.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-7.webp)

3. Configure the contract parameters:

    1. Enter the address that will own the deployed NFT.
    2. Click the **Deploy** button to initiate the deployment.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-8.webp)

4. **Talisman will pop up**: Review the transaction details. Click **Approve** to deploy your contract.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-9.webp){: .browser-extension}

    Deploying this contract requires paying gas fees in PAS tokens on the Polkadot Hub TestNet. Ensure your Talisman account is funded with sufficient PAS tokens from the faucet before confirming the transaction, check the [Test Tokens](/develop/smart-contracts/connect-to-polkadot/#test-tokens){target=\_blank} section for more information. Gas fees cover the computational resources needed to deploy and execute the smart contract on the blockchain.

    If the deployment process succeeded, you will see the following output in the terminal:

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-10.webp)

## Interact with Your NFT Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with your contract through Remix:

1. Find your contract under **Deployed/Unpinned Contracts**, and click it to expand the available methods for the contract.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-11.webp)

2. To mint an NFT:

    1. Click on the contract to expand its associated methods.
    2. Expand the **safeMint** function.
    3. Enter the recipient address.
    4. Click **Transact**.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-12.webp)

3. Click **Approve** to confirm the transaction in the Talisman popup.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-13.webp){: .browser-extension}

    If the transaction is successful, the terminal will display the following output, which details the information about the transaction, including the transaction hash, the block number, the associated logs, and so on.

    ![](/images/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/deploy-nft-14.webp)

Page Title: Deploy Contracts to Polkadot Hub with Ethers.js

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/develop-smart-contracts-libraries-ethers-js.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/ethers-js/
- Summary: Learn how to interact with Polkadot Hub using Ethers.js, from compiling and deploying Solidity contracts to interacting with deployed smart contracts.

# Ethers.js

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

[Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank} is a lightweight library that enables interaction with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains through JavaScript. Ethers is widely used as a toolkit to establish connections and read and write blockchain data. This article demonstrates using Ethers.js to interact and deploy smart contracts to Polkadot Hub.

This guide is intended for developers who are familiar with JavaScript and want to interact with Polkadot Hub using Ethers.js.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.13.1 or later, check the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/){target=\_blank}.
- **npm**: v6.13.4 or later (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **Solidity**: This guide uses Solidity `^0.8.9` for smart contract development.

## Project Structure

This project organizes contracts, scripts, and compiled artifacts for easy development and deployment.

```text title="Ethers.js Polkadot Hub"
ethers-project
├── contracts
│   ├── Storage.sol
├── scripts
│   ├── connectToProvider.js
│   ├── fetchLastBlock.js
│   ├── compile.js
│   ├── deploy.js
│   ├── checkStorage.js

├── artifacts
│   ├── Storage.polkavm
├── contract-address.json
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

## Set Up the Project

To start working with Ethers.js, create a new folder and initialize your project by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir ethers-project
cd ethers-project
npm init -y
```

## Install Dependencies

Next, run the following command to install the Ethers.js library:

```bash
npm install ethers
```

## Set Up the Ethers.js Provider

A [`Provider`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Provider){target=\_blank} is an abstraction of a connection to the Ethereum network, allowing you to query blockchain data and send transactions. It serves as a bridge between your application and the blockchain.

To interact with Polkadot Hub, you must set up an Ethers.js provider. This provider connects to a blockchain node, allowing you to query blockchain data and interact with smart contracts. In the root of your project, create a file named `connectToProvider.js` and add the following code:

```js title="scripts/connectToProvider.js"
const { JsonRpcProvider } = require('ethers');

const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
  const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, {
    chainId: chainId,
    name: chainName,
  });

  return provider;
};

const PROVIDER_RPC = {
  rpc: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
  chainId: 'INSERT_CHAIN_ID',
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
};

createProvider(PROVIDER_RPC.rpc, PROVIDER_RPC.chainId, PROVIDER_RPC.name);

```

!!! note
    Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, and `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME` with the appropriate values. For example, to connect to Polkadot Hub TestNet's Ethereum RPC instance, you can use the following parameters:

    ```js
    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
        rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
        chainId: 420420422,
        name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet'
    };
    ```

To connect to the provider, execute:

```bash
node connectToProvider
```

With the provider set up, you can start querying the blockchain. For instance, to fetch the latest block number:

??? code "Fetch Last Block code"

    ```js title="scripts/fetchLastBlock.js"
    const { JsonRpcProvider } = require('ethers');

    const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
      const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, {
        chainId: chainId,
        name: chainName,
      });

      return provider;
    };

    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
    };

    const main = async () => {
      try {
        const provider = createProvider(
          PROVIDER_RPC.rpc,
          PROVIDER_RPC.chainId,
          PROVIDER_RPC.name,
        );
        const latestBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber();
        console.log(`Latest block: ${latestBlock}`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + error.message);
      }
    };

    main();

    ```

## Compile Contracts

!!! note "Contracts Code Blob Size Disclaimer"
    The maximum contract code blob size on Polkadot Hub networks is _100 kilobytes_, significantly larger than Ethereum’s EVM limit of 24 kilobytes.

    For detailed comparisons and migration guidelines, see the [EVM vs. PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/evm-vs-polkavm/#current-memory-limits){target=\_blank} documentation page.

The `revive` compiler transforms Solidity smart contracts into [PolkaVM](/develop/smart-contracts/overview#native-smart-contracts){target=\_blank} bytecode for deployment on Polkadot Hub. Revive's Ethereum RPC interface allows you to use familiar tools like Ethers.js and MetaMask to interact with contracts.

### Install the Revive Library

The [`@parity/resolc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parity/resolc){target=\_blank} library will compile your Solidity code for deployment on Polkadot Hub. Run the following command in your terminal to install the library:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @parity/resolc 
```

This guide uses `@parity/resolc` version `0.2.0`.

### Sample Storage Smart Contract

This example demonstrates compiling a `Storage.sol` Solidity contract for deployment to Polkadot Hub. The contract's functionality stores a number and permits users to update it with a new value.

```solidity title="contracts/Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
// It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

### Compile the Smart Contract

To compile this contract, use the following script:

```js title="scripts/compile.js"
const { compile } = require('@parity/resolc');
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync } = require('fs');
const { basename, join } = require('path');

const compileContract = async (solidityFilePath, outputDir) => {
  try {
    // Read the Solidity file
    const source = readFileSync(solidityFilePath, 'utf8');

    // Construct the input object for the compiler
    const input = {
      [basename(solidityFilePath)]: { content: source },
    };

    console.log(`Compiling contract: ${basename(solidityFilePath)}...`);

    // Compile the contract
    const out = await compile(input);

    for (const contracts of Object.values(out.contracts)) {
      for (const [name, contract] of Object.entries(contracts)) {
        console.log(`Compiled contract: ${name}`);

        // Write the ABI
        const abiPath = join(outputDir, `${name}.json`);
        writeFileSync(abiPath, JSON.stringify(contract.abi, null, 2));
        console.log(`ABI saved to ${abiPath}`);

        // Write the bytecode
        const bytecodePath = join(outputDir, `${name}.polkavm`);
        writeFileSync(
          bytecodePath,
          Buffer.from(contract.evm.bytecode.object, 'hex'),
        );
        console.log(`Bytecode saved to ${bytecodePath}`);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error compiling contracts:', error);
  }
};

const solidityFilePath = join(__dirname, '../contracts/Storage.sol');
const outputDir = join(__dirname, '../contracts');

compileContract(solidityFilePath, outputDir);

```

!!! note 
     The script above is tailored to the `Storage.sol` contract. It can be adjusted for other contracts by changing the file name or modifying the ABI and bytecode paths.

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a JSON representation of your contract's functions, events, and their parameters. It serves as the interface between your JavaScript code and the deployed smart contract, allowing your application to know how to format function calls and interpret returned data.

Execute the script above by running:

```bash
node compile
```

After executing the script, the Solidity contract will be compiled into the required PolkaVM bytecode format. The ABI and bytecode will be saved into files with `.json` and `.polkavm` extensions, respectively. You can now proceed with deploying the contract to Polkadot Hub, as outlined in the next section.

## Deploy the Compiled Contract

To deploy your compiled contract to Polkadot Hub, you'll need a wallet with a private key to sign the deployment transaction.

You can create a `deploy.js` script in the root of your project to achieve this. The deployment script can be divided into key components:

1. Set up the required imports and utilities:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    // Deploy an EVM-compatible smart contract using ethers.js
    const { writeFileSync, existsSync, readFileSync } = require('fs');
    const { join } = require('path');
    const { ethers, JsonRpcProvider } = require('ethers');

    const codegenDir = join(__dirname);
    ```

2. Create a provider to connect to Polkadot Hub:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"

    // Creates an Ethereum provider with specified RPC URL and chain details
    const createProvider = (rpcUrl, chainId, chainName) => {
      const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, {
        chainId: chainId,
        name: chainName,
      });
      return provider;
    };
    ```
 
3. Set up functions to read contract artifacts:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    // Reads and parses the ABI file for a given contract
    const getAbi = (contractName) => {
      try {
        return JSON.parse(
          readFileSync(join(codegenDir, `${contractName}.json`), 'utf8'),
        );
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };

    // Reads the compiled bytecode for a given contract
    const getByteCode = (contractName) => {
      try {
        const bytecodePath = join(
          codegenDir,
          '../contracts',
          `${contractName}.polkavm`,
        );
        return `0x${readFileSync(bytecodePath).toString('hex')}`;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(
          `Could not find bytecode for contract ${contractName}:`,
          error.message,
        );
        throw error;
      }
    };
    ```

4. Create the main deployment function:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"

    const deployContract = async (contractName, mnemonic, providerConfig) => {
      console.log(`Deploying ${contractName}...`);

      try {
        // Step 1: Set up provider and wallet
        const provider = createProvider(
          providerConfig.rpc,
          providerConfig.chainId,
          providerConfig.name,
        );
        const walletMnemonic = ethers.Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic);
        const wallet = walletMnemonic.connect(provider);

        // Step 2: Create and deploy the contract
        const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(
          getAbi(contractName),
          getByteCode(contractName),
          wallet,
        );
        const contract = await factory.deploy();
        await contract.waitForDeployment();

        // Step 3: Save deployment information
        const address = await contract.getAddress();
        console.log(`Contract ${contractName} deployed at: ${address}`);

        const addressesFile = join(codegenDir, 'contract-address.json');
        const addresses = existsSync(addressesFile)
          ? JSON.parse(readFileSync(addressesFile, 'utf8'))
          : {};
        addresses[contractName] = address;
        writeFileSync(addressesFile, JSON.stringify(addresses, null, 2), 'utf8');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to deploy contract ${contractName}:`, error);
      }
    };
    ```

5. Configure and execute the deployment:

    ```js title="scripts/deploy.js"
    const providerConfig = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
      chainId: 420420422,

    !!! note
        A mnemonic (seed phrase) is a series of words that can generate multiple private keys and their corresponding addresses. It's used here to derive the wallet that will sign and pay for the deployment transaction. **Always keep your mnemonic secure and never share it publicly**.

        Ensure to replace the `INSERT_MNEMONIC` placeholder with your actual mnemonic.

    const mnemonic = 'INSERT_MNEMONIC';

    deployContract('Storage', mnemonic, providerConfig);

    ```

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
node deploy
```

After running this script, your contract will be deployed to Polkadot Hub, and its address will be saved in `contract-address.json` within your project directory. You can use this address for future contract interactions.

## Interact with the Contract

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling its functions. For example, to set a number, read it and then modify that number by its double, you can create a file named `checkStorage.js` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```js title="scripts/checkStorage.js"
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
const { join } = require('path');

const createProvider = (providerConfig) => {
  return new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerConfig.rpc, {
    chainId: providerConfig.chainId,
    name: providerConfig.name,
  });
};

const createWallet = (mnemonic, provider) => {
  return ethers.Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic).connect(provider);
};

const loadContractAbi = (contractName, directory = __dirname) => {
  const contractPath = join(directory, `${contractName}.json`);
  const contractJson = JSON.parse(readFileSync(contractPath, 'utf8'));
  return contractJson.abi || contractJson; // Depending on JSON structure
};

const createContract = (contractAddress, abi, wallet) => {
  return new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, wallet);
};

const interactWithStorageContract = async (
  contractName,
  contractAddress,
  mnemonic,
  providerConfig,
  numberToSet,
) => {
  try {
    console.log(`Setting new number in Storage contract: ${numberToSet}`);

    // Create provider and wallet
    const provider = createProvider(providerConfig);
    const wallet = createWallet(mnemonic, provider);

    // Load the contract ABI and create the contract instance
    const abi = loadContractAbi(contractName);
    const contract = createContract(contractAddress, abi, wallet);

    // Send a transaction to set the stored number
    const tx1 = await contract.setNumber(numberToSet);
    await tx1.wait(); // Wait for the transaction to be mined
    console.log(`Number successfully set to ${numberToSet}`);

    // Retrieve the updated number
    const storedNumber = await contract.storedNumber();
    console.log(`Retrieved stored number:`, storedNumber.toString());

    // Send a transaction to set the stored number
    const tx2 = await contract.setNumber(numberToSet * 2);
    await tx2.wait(); // Wait for the transaction to be mined
    console.log(`Number successfully set to ${numberToSet * 2}`);

    // Retrieve the updated number
    const updatedNumber = await contract.storedNumber();
    console.log(`Retrieved stored number:`, updatedNumber.toString());
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error interacting with Storage contract:', error.message);
  }
};

const providerConfig = {
  name: 'asset-hub-smart-contracts',
  rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
  chainId: 420420422,
};

const mnemonic = 'INSERT_MNEMONIC';
const contractName = 'Storage';
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const newNumber = 42;

interactWithStorageContract(
  contractName,
  contractAddress,
  mnemonic,
  providerConfig,
  newNumber,
);

```

Ensure you replace the `INSERT_MNEMONIC`, `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, and `INSERT_ADDRESS_TO_CHECK` placeholders with actual values. Also, ensure the contract ABI file (`Storage.json`) is correctly referenced.

To interact with the contract, run:

```bash
node checkStorage
```

## Where to Go Next

Now that you have the foundational knowledge to use Ethers.js with Polkadot Hub, you can:

- **Dive into Ethers.js utilities**: Discover additional Ethers.js features, such as wallet management, signing messages, etc.
- **Implement batch transactions**: Use Ethers.js to execute batch transactions for efficient multi-step contract interactions.
- **Build scalable applications**: Combine Ethers.js with frameworks like [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} or [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en){target=\_blank} to create full-stack decentralized applications (dApps).

# EVM vs PolkaVM

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

While [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design/){target=\_blank} strives for maximum Ethereum compatibility, several fundamental design decisions create necessary divergences from the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/){target=\_blank}. These differences represent trade-offs that enhance performance and resource management while maintaining accessibility for Solidity developers.

## Core Virtual Machine Architecture

The most significant departure from Ethereum comes from PolkaVM's foundation itself. Rather than implementing the EVM, PolkaVM utilizes a RISC-V instruction set. For most Solidity developers, this architectural change remains transparent thanks to the [Revive compiler's](https://github.com/paritytech/revive){target=\_blank} complete Solidity support, including inline assembler functionality.

    end

    EthExecution -.-> DifferencesNote["Key Differences:
    - Instruction Set Architecture
    - Bytecode Format
    - Runtime Behavior"]
    PolkaExecution -.-> DifferencesNote
```

However, this architectural difference becomes relevant in specific scenarios. Tools that attempt to download and inspect contract bytecode will fail, as they expect EVM bytecode rather than PolkaVM's RISC-V format. Most applications typically pass bytecode as an opaque blob, making this a non-issue for standard use cases.

This primarily affects contracts using [`EXTCODECOPY`](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=cancun#3c){target=\_blank} to manipulate code at runtime. A contract encounters problems specifically when it uses `EXTCODECOPY` to copy contract code into memory and then attempts to mutate it. This pattern is not possible in standard Solidity and requires dropping down to YUL assembly. An example would be a factory contract written in assembly that constructs and instantiates new contracts by generating code at runtime. Such contracts are rare in practice.

PolkaVM offers an elegant alternative through its [on-chain constructors](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.bare_instantiate){target=\_blank}, enabling contract instantiation without runtime code modification, making this pattern unnecessary. This architectural difference also impacts how contract deployment works more broadly, as discussed in the [Contract Deployment](#contract-deployment) section.

## Gas Model

Ethereum's resource model relies on a single metric: [gas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#what-is-gas){target=\_blank}, which serves as the universal unit for measuring computational costs. Each operation on the network consumes a specific amount of gas. Most platforms aiming for Ethereum compatibility typically adopt identical gas values to ensure seamless integration.

The significant changes to Ethereum's gas model will be outlined in the following sections.

### Dynamic Gas Value Scaling

Instead of adhering to Ethereum's fixed gas values, PolkaVM implements benchmark-based pricing that better reflects its improved execution performance. This makes instructions cheaper relative to I/O-bound operations but requires developers to avoid hardcoding gas values, particularly in cross-contract calls.

### Multi-Dimensional Resource Metering

Moving beyond Ethereum's single gas metric, PolkaVM meters three distinct resources:

- **`ref_time`**: Equivalent to traditional gas, measuring computation time.
- **`proof_size`**: Tracks state proof size for validator verification.
- **`storage_deposit`**: Manages state bloat through a deposit system.

All three resources can be limited at the transaction level, just like gas on Ethereum. The [Ethereum RPC proxy](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/revive/rpc){target=\_blank} maps all three dimensions into the single gas dimension, ensuring everything behaves as expected for users.

These resources can also be limited when making cross-contract calls, which is essential for security when interacting with untrusted contracts. However, Solidity only allows specifying `gas_limit` for cross-contract calls. The `gas_limit` is most similar to Polkadots `ref_time_limit`, but the Revive compiler doesn't supply any imposed `gas_limit` for cross-contract calls for two key reasons:

- **Semantic differences**: `gas_limit` and `ref_time_limit` are not semantically identical; blindly passing EVM gas as `ref_time_limit` can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Incomplete protection**: The other two resources (`proof_size` and `storage_deposit`) would remain uncapped anyway, making it insufficient to prevent malicious callees from performing DOS attacks.

When resources are "uncapped" in cross-contract calls, they remain constrained by transaction-specified limits, preventing abuse of the transaction signer.

!!! note
    The runtime will provide a special precompile, allowing cross-contract calls with limits specified for all weight dimensions in the future.

All gas-related opcodes like [`GAS`](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=cancun#5a){target=\_blank} or [`GAS_LIMIT`](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=cancun#45){target=\_blank} return only the `ref_time` value as it's the closest match to traditional gas. Extended APIs will be provided through precompiles to make full use of all resources, including cross-contract calls with all three resources specified.

## Memory Management

The EVM and the PolkaVM take fundamentally different approaches to memory constraints:

|         Feature          |      Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)       |                    PolkaVM                     |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
|  **Memory Constraints**  |      Indirect control via gas costs       |        Hard memory limits per contract         |
|      **Cost Model**      | Increasing gas curve with allocation size |    Fixed costs separated from execution gas    |
|    **Memory Limits**     | Soft limits through prohibitive gas costs |         Hard fixed limits per contract         |
|  **Pricing Efficiency**  |     Potential overcharging for memory     | More efficient through separation of concerns  |
|   **Contract Nesting**   |         Limited by available gas          |    Limited by constant memory per contract     |
|   **Memory Metering**    |     Dynamic based on total allocation     |      Static limits per contract instance       |
| **Future Improvements**  |       Incremental gas cost updates        | Potential dynamic metering for deeper nesting  |
| **Cross-Contract Calls** |      Handled through gas forwarding       | Requires careful boundary limit implementation |

The architecture establishes a constant memory limit per contract, which is the basis for calculating maximum contract nesting depth. This calculation assumes worst-case memory usage for each nested contract, resulting in a straightforward but conservative limit that operates independently of actual memory consumption. Future iterations may introduce dynamic memory metering, allowing deeper nesting depths for contracts with smaller memory footprints. However, such an enhancement would require careful implementation of cross-contract boundary limits before API stabilization, as it would introduce an additional resource metric to the system.

### Current Memory Limits

The following table depicts memory-related limits at the time of writing:

|                   Limit                    |     Maximum     |
|:------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
|              Call stack depth              |        5        |
|                Event topics                |        4        |
| Event data payload size (including topics) |    416 bytes    |
|             Storage value size             |    416 bytes    |
|        Transient storage variables         | 128 uint values |
|            Immutable variables             | 16 uint values  |
|          Contract code blob size           | ~100 kilobytes  |

!!! note
    Limits might be increased in the future. To guarantee existing contracts work as expected, limits will never be decreased.

## Account Management - Existential Deposit

Ethereum and Polkadot handle account persistence differently, affecting state management and contract interactions:

### Account Management Comparison

|          Feature          |                   Ethereum Approach                   |               PolkaVM/Polkadot Approach                |
|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|
|  **Account Persistence**  | Accounts persist indefinitely, even with zero balance | Requires existential deposit (ED) to maintain account  |
|    **Minimum Balance**    |                         None                          |                      ED required                       |
|   **Account Deletion**    |               Accounts remain in state                |      Accounts below ED are automatically deleted       |
|   **Contract Accounts**   |                  Exist indefinitely                   |                    Must maintain ED                    |
|   **Balance Reporting**   |                 Reports full balance                  |      Reports ED-adjusted balance via Ethereum RPC      |
| **New Account Transfers** |                   Standard transfer                   |     Includes ED automatically with extra fee cost      |
| **Contract-to-Contract**  |                   Direct transfers                    | ED drawn from transaction signer, not sending contract |
|   **State Management**    |      Potential bloat from zero-balance accounts       |     Optimized with auto-deletion of dust accounts      |

This difference introduces potential compatibility challenges for Ethereum-based contracts and tools, particularly wallets. To mitigate this, PolkaVM implements several transparent adjustments:

- Balance queries via Ethereum RPC automatically deduct the ED, ensuring reported balances match spendable amounts.
- Account balance checks through EVM opcodes reflect the ED-adjusted balance.
- Transfers to new accounts automatically include the ED (`x + ED`), with the extra cost incorporated into transaction fees.
- Contract-to-contract transfers handle ED requirements by:
    - Drawing ED from the transaction signer instead of the sending contract.
    - Keeping transfer amounts transparent for contract logic.
    - Treating ED like other storage deposit costs.

This approach ensures that Ethereum contracts work without modifications while maintaining Polkadot's optimized state management.

## Contract Deployment

For most users deploying contracts (like ERC-20 tokens), contract deployment works seamlessly without requiring special steps. However, when using advanced patterns like factory contracts that dynamically create other contracts at runtime, you'll need to understand PolkaVM's unique deployment model.

In the PolkaVM, contract deployment follows a fundamentally different model from EVM. The EVM allows contracts to be deployed with a single transaction, where the contract code is bundled with the deployment transaction. In contrast, PolkaVM has a different process for contract instantiation.

- **Code must be pre-uploaded**: Unlike EVM, where contract code is bundled within the deploying contract, PolkaVM requires all contract bytecode to be uploaded to the chain before instantiation.
- **Factory pattern limitations**: The common EVM pattern, where contracts dynamically create other contracts, will fail with a `CodeNotFound` error unless the dependent contract code was previously uploaded.
- **Separate upload and instantiation**: This creates a two-step process where developers must first upload all contract code, then instantiate relationships between contracts.

This architecture impacts several common EVM patterns and requires developers to adapt their deployment strategies accordingly. _Factory contracts must be modified to work with pre-uploaded code rather than embedding bytecode_, and runtime code generation is not supported due to PolkaVM's RISC-V bytecode format. The specific behavior of contract creation opcodes is detailed in the [YUL IR Translation](#yul-function-translation-differences) section.

When migrating EVM projects to PolkaVM, developers should identify all contracts that will be instantiated at runtime and ensure they are pre-uploaded to the chain before any instantiation attempts.

## Solidity and YUL IR Translation Incompatibilities

While PolkaVM maintains high-level compatibility with Solidity, several low-level differences exist in the translation of YUL IR and specific Solidity constructs. These differences are particularly relevant for developers working with assembly code or utilizing advanced contract patterns.

### Contract Code Structure

PolkaVM's contract runtime does not differentiate between runtime code and deploy (constructor) code. Instead, both are emitted into a single PolkaVM contract code blob and live on-chain. Therefore, in EVM terminology, the deploy code equals the runtime code. For most standard Solidity contracts, this is transparent. However, if you are analyzing raw bytecode or building tools that expect separate deploy and runtime sections, you'll need to adjust for this unified structure.

In the constructor code, the `codesize` instruction returns the call data size instead of the actual code blob size, which differs from standard EVM behavior. Developers might consider that the constructor logic uses `codesize` to inspect the deployed contract's size (e.g., for self-validation or specific deployment patterns); this will return an incorrect value on PolkaVM. Re-evaluate such logic or use alternative methods to achieve your goal.

### Solidity-Specific Differences

Solidity constructs behave differently under PolkaVM:

- **`address.creationCode`**: Returns the bytecode keccak256 hash instead of the actual creation code, reflecting PolkaVM's hash-based code referencing system.
    - If your contract relies on `address.creationCode` to verify or interact with the full raw bytecode of a newly deployed contract, this will not work as expected. You will receive a hash, not the code itself. This typically affects highly specialized factory contracts or introspection tools.

### YUL Function Translation Differences

The following YUL functions exhibit notable behavioral differences in PolkaVM:

- Memory operations:

    - **`mload`, `mstore`, `msize`, `mcopy`**: PolkaVM preserves memory layout but implements several constraints.

        - EVM linear heap memory is emulated using a fixed 64KB byte buffer, limiting maximum contract memory usage.
        - Accessing memory offsets larger than the buffer size traps the contract with an `OutOfBound` error.
        - Compiler optimizations may eliminate unused memory operations, potentially causing `msize` to differ from EVM behavior.

        For Solidity developers, the compiler generally handles memory efficiently within this 64KB limit. However, if you are writing low-level YUL assembly and perform direct memory manipulations, you must respect the 64KB buffer limit. Attempting to access memory outside this range will cause your transaction to revert. Be aware that `msize` might not always reflect the exact EVM behavior if compiler optimizations occur.

- Call data operations:

    - **`calldataload`, `calldatacopy`**: In constructor code, the offset parameter is ignored and these functions always return `0`, diverging from EVM behavior where call data represents constructor arguments.

        - If your constructor logic in YUL assembly attempts to read constructor arguments using `calldataload` or `calldatacopy` with specific offsets, this will not yield the expected constructor arguments. Instead, these functions will return `zeroed` values. Standard Solidity constructors are handled correctly by the compiler, but manual YUL assembly for constructor argument parsing will need adjustment.

- Code operations:

    - **`codecopy`**: Only supported within constructor code, reflecting PolkaVM's different approach to code handling and the unified code blob structure.

        - If your contracts use `codecopy` (e.g., for self-modifying code or inspecting other contract's runtime bytecode) outside of the constructor, this will not be supported and will likely result in a compile-time error or runtime trap. This implies that patterns like dynamically generating or modifying contract code at runtime are not directly feasible with `codecopy` on PolkaVM.

- Control flow:

    - **`invalid`**: Traps the contract execution but does not consume remaining gas, unlike EVM where it consumes all available gas.

        - While `invalid` still reverts the transaction, the difference in gas consumption could subtly affect very specific error handling or gas accounting patterns that rely on `invalid` to consume all remaining gas. For most error scenarios, `revert()` is the standard and recommended practice.

- Cross-contract calls:

    - **`call`, `delegatecall`, `staticall`**: These functions ignore supplied gas limits and forward all remaining resources due to PolkaVM's multi-dimensional resource model. This creates important security implications:

        - Contract authors must implement reentrancy protection since gas stipends don't provide protection.
        - The compiler detects `address payable.{send,transfer}` patterns and disables call reentrancy as a protective heuristic.
        - Using `address payable.{send,transfer}` is already deprecated; PolkaVM will provide dedicated precompiles for safe balance transfers.

        The traditional EVM pattern of limiting gas in cross-contract calls (especially with the 2300 gas stipend for send/transfer) does not provide reentrancy protection on PolkaVM. Developers must explicitly implement reentrancy guards (e.g., using a reentrancy lock mutex) in their Solidity code when making external calls to untrusted contracts. Relying on gas limits alone for reentrancy prevention is unsafe and will lead to vulnerabilities on PolkaVM.

        !!! warning
            The 2300 gas stipend that is provided by solc for address payable.{send, transfer} calls offers no reentrancy protection in PolkaVM. While the compiler attempts to detect and mitigate this pattern, developers should avoid these deprecated functions.

- Contract creation:

    - **`create`, `create2`**: Contract instantiation works fundamentally differently in PolkaVM. Instead of supplying deploy code concatenated with constructor arguments, the runtime expects:

        1. A buffer containing the code hash to deploy.
        2. The constructor arguments buffer.

        PolkaVM translates `dataoffset` and `datasize` instructions to handle contract hashes instead of contract code, enabling seamless use of the `new` keyword in Solidity. However, this translation may fail for contracts creating other contracts within `assembly` blocks.

        If you use the Solidity `new` keyword to deploy contracts, the Revive compiler handles this transparently. However, if you are creating contracts manually in YUL assembly using `create` or `create2` opcodes, you must provide the code hash of the contract to be deployed, not its raw bytecode. Attempting to pass raw bytecode will fail. This fundamentally changes how manual contract creation is performed in assembly.

        !!! warning
            Avoid using `create` family opcodes for manual deployment crafting in `assembly` blocks. This pattern is discouraged due to translation complexity and offers no gas savings benefits in PolkaVM.

- Data operations:

    - **`dataoffset`**: Returns the contract hash instead of code offset, aligning with PolkaVM's hash-based code referencing.
    - **`datasize`**: Returns the constant contract hash size (32 bytes) rather than variable code size.

    These changes are primarily relevant for low-level YUL assembly developers who are trying to inspect or manipulate contract code directly. `dataoffset` will provide a hash, not a memory offset to the code, and `datasize` will always be 32 bytes (the size of a hash). This reinforces that direct manipulation of contract bytecode at runtime, as might be done in some EVM patterns, is not supported.

- Resource queries:

    - **`gas`, `gaslimit`**: Return only the `ref_time` component of PolkaVM's multi-dimensional weight system, providing the closest analog to traditional gas measurements.

        - While `gas` and `gaslimit` still provide a useful metric, consider that they represent `ref_time` (computation time) only. If your contract logic depends on precise knowledge of other resource costs (like `proof_size` or `storage_deposit`), you won't get that information from these opcodes. You'll need to use future precompiles for full multi-dimensional resource queries.

- Blockchain state:

    - **`prevrandao`, `difficulty`**: Both translate to a constant value of `2500000000000000`, as PolkaVM doesn't implement Ethereum's difficulty adjustment or randomness mechanisms.

        - If your Solidity contract relies on `block.difficulty` (or its equivalent YUL opcode `difficulty`) for randomness generation or any logic tied to Ethereum's proof-of-work difficulty, this will not provide true randomness on PolkaVM. The value will always be constant. Developers needing on-chain randomness should utilize Polkadot's native randomness sources or dedicated VRF (Verifiable Random Function) solutions if available. 

### Unsupported Operations

Several EVM operations are not supported in PolkaVM and produce compile-time errors:

- **`pc`, `extcodecopy`**: These operations are EVM-specific and have no equivalent functionality in PolkaVM's RISC-V architecture.

    - Any Solidity contracts that utilize inline assembly to interact with `pc` (program counter) or `extcodecopy` will fail to compile or behave unexpectedly. This means patterns involving introspection of the current execution location or copying external contract bytecode at runtime are not supported.

- **`blobhash`, `blobbasefee`**: Related to Ethereum's rollup model and blob data handling, these operations are unnecessary given Polkadot's superior rollup architecture.

    - If you are porting contracts designed for Ethereum's EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) and rely on these blob-related opcodes, they will not be available on PolkaVM.

- **`extcodecopy`, `selfdestruct`**: These deprecated operations are not supported and generate compile-time errors.

    - The `selfdestruct` opcode, which allowed contracts to remove themselves from the blockchain, is not supported. Contracts cannot be self-destroyed on PolkaVM. This affects contract upgradeability patterns that rely on self-destruction and redeployment. Similarly, `extcodecopy` is unsupported, impacting contracts that intend to inspect or copy the bytecode of other deployed contracts.

### Compilation Pipeline Considerations

PolkaVM processes YUL IR exclusively, meaning all contracts exhibit behavior consistent with Solidity's `via-ir` compilation mode. Developers familiar with the legacy compilation pipeline should expect [IR-based codegen behavior](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/ir-breaking-changes.html){target=\_blank} when working with PolkaVM contracts.

If you've previously worked with older Solidity compilers that did not use the `via-ir` pipeline by default, you might observe subtle differences in compiled bytecode size or gas usage. It's recommended to familiarize yourself with Solidity's IR-based codegen behavior, as this is the standard for PolkaVM.

### Memory Pointer Limitations

YUL functions accepting memory buffer offset pointers or size arguments are limited by PolkaVM's 32-bit pointer size. Supplying values above `2^32-1` will trap the contract immediately. The Solidity compiler typically generates valid memory references, making this primarily a concern for low-level assembly code.

For standard Solidity development, this limitation is unlikely to be hit as the compiler handles memory addresses correctly within typical contract sizes. However, if you are writing extremely large contracts using YUL assembly that manually and extensively manipulate memory addresses, ensure that your memory offsets and sizes do not exceed PolkaVM's **fixed 64KB memory limit per contract**. While the YUL functions might accept 32-bit pointers (up to 2^32-1), attempting to access memory beyond the allocated 64KB buffer will trap the contract immediately.

These incompatibilities reflect the fundamental architectural differences between EVM and PolkaVM while maintaining high-level Solidity compatibility. Most developers using standard Solidity patterns will encounter no issues, but those working with assembly code or advanced contract patterns should carefully review these differences during migration.

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/tutorials-polkadot-sdk-testing-fork-live-chains.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/
- Summary: Learn how to fork live Polkadot SDK chains with Chopsticks. Configure forks, replay blocks, test XCM, and interact programmatically or via UI.

# Fork a Chain with Chopsticks

## Introduction

Chopsticks is an innovative tool that simplifies the process of forking live Polkadot SDK chains. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure and fork chains, enabling developers to:

- Replay blocks for state analysis.
- Test cross-chain messaging (XCM).
- Simulate blockchain environments for debugging and experimentation.

With support for both configuration files and CLI commands, Chopsticks offers flexibility for diverse development workflows. Whether you're testing locally or exploring complex blockchain scenarios, Chopsticks empowers developers to gain deeper insights and accelerate application development.

Chopsticks uses the [Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=\_blank} light client, which does not support calls made through the Ethereum JSON-RPC. As a result, you can't fork your chain using Chopsticks and then interact with it using tools like MetaMask.

For additional support and information, please reach out through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/issues){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have completed the following:

- **Installed Chopsticks**: If you still need to do so, see the [Install Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/#install-chopsticks){target=\_blank} guide for assistance.
- **Reviewed** [Configure Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/#configure-chopsticks){target=\_blank}: And understand how forked chains are configured.

## Configuration File 

To run Chopsticks using a configuration file, utilize the `--config` flag. You can use a raw GitHub URL, a path to a local file, or simply the chain's name. The following commands all look different but they use the `polkadot` configuration in the same way:

=== "GitHub URL"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
    --config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

=== "Local File Path"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

=== "Chain Name"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=polkadot
    ```

Regardless of which method you choose from the preceding examples, you'll see an output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=polkadot</span>
  <br />
  <span data-ty>[18:38:26.155] INFO: Loading config file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot.yml</span>
  <span data-ty> app: "chopsticks"</span>
  <span data-ty> chopsticks::executor TRACE: Calling Metadata_metadata</span>
  <span data-ty> chopsticks::executor TRACE: Completed Metadata_metadata</span>
  <span data-ty>[18:38:28.186] INFO: Polkadot RPC listening on port 8000</span>
  <span data-ty> app: "chopsticks"</span>
</div>

If using a file path, make sure you've downloaded the [Polkadot configuration file](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/blob/master/configs/polkadot.yml){target=\_blank}, or have created your own.

## Create a Fork

Once you've configured Chopsticks, use the following command to fork Polkadot at block 100:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
--endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com \
--block 100
```

If the fork is successful, you will see output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx @acala-network/chopsticks \ --endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com \ --block 100</span>
  <br />
  <span data-ty>[19:12:21.023] INFO: Polkadot RPC listening on port 8000</span>
  <span data-ty> app: "chopsticks"</span>
</div>

Access the running Chopsticks fork using the default address.

```bash
ws://localhost:8000
```

## Interact with a Fork

You can interact with the forked chain using various [libraries](/develop/toolkit/#libraries){target=\_blank} such as [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/){target=\_blank} and its user interface, [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank}.

### Use Polkadot.js Apps

To interact with Chopsticks via the hosted user interface, visit [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} and follow these steps:

1. Select the network icon in the top left corner.

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/chopsticks-1.webp)

2. Scroll to the bottom and select **Development**.
3. Choose **Custom**.
4. Enter `ws://localhost:8000` in the input field.
5. Select the **Switch** button.

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/chopsticks-2.webp)

You should now be connected to your local fork and can interact with it as you would with a real chain.

### Use Polkadot.js Library

For programmatic interaction, you can use the Polkadot.js library. The following is a basic example:

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

async function connectToFork() {
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('ws://localhost:8000');
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });
  await api.isReady;

  // Now you can use 'api' to interact with your fork
  console.log(`Connected to chain: ${await api.rpc.system.chain()}`);
}

connectToFork();

```

## Replay Blocks

Chopsticks allows you to replay specific blocks from a chain, which is useful for debugging and analyzing state changes. You can use the parameters in the [Configuration](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/#configure-chopsticks){target=\_blank} section to set up the chain configuration, and then use the run-block subcommand with the following additional options:

- **`output-path`**: Path to print output.
- **`html`**: Generate HTML with storage diff.
- **`open`**: Open generated HTML.

For example, the command to replay block 1000 from Polkadot and save the output to a JSON file would be as follows:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks run-block  \
--endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com  \
--output-path ./polkadot-output.json  \
--block 1000
```

??? code "polkadot-output.json"

    ```json
    {
        "Call": {
            "result": "0xba754e7478944d07a1f7e914422b4d973b0855abeb6f81138fdca35beb474b44a10f6fc59a4d90c3b78e38fac100fc6adc6f9e69a07565ec8abce6165bd0d24078cc7bf34f450a2cc7faacc1fa1e244b959f0ed65437f44208876e1e5eefbf8dd34c040642414245b501030100000083e2cc0f00000000d889565422338aa58c0fd8ebac32234149c7ce1f22ac2447a02ef059b58d4430ca96ba18fbf27d06fe92ec86d8b348ef42f6d34435c791b952018d0a82cae40decfe5faf56203d88fdedee7b25f04b63f41f23da88c76c876db5c264dad2f70c",

## XCM Testing

To test XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) messages between networks, you can fork multiple parachains and a relay chain locally using Chopsticks.

- **`relaychain`**: Relay chain config file.
- **`parachain`**: Parachain config file.

For example, to fork Moonbeam, Astar, and Polkadot enabling XCM between them, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks xcm \
--r polkadot \
--p moonbeam \
--p astar
```

After running it, you should see output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx @acala-network/chopsticks xcm \</span>
  <span data-ty>--r polkadot \</span>

Page Title: Glossary

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/polkadot-protocol-glossary.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/glossary/
- Summary: Glossary of terms used within the Polkadot ecosystem, Polkadot SDK, its subsequent libraries, and other relevant Web3 terminology.

# Glossary

Key definitions, concepts, and terminology specific to the Polkadot ecosystem are included here.

Additional glossaries from around the ecosystem you might find helpful:

- [Polkadot Wiki Glossary](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/glossary){target=\_blank}
- [Polkadot SDK Glossary](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/glossary/index.html){target=\_blank}

## Authority

The role in a blockchain that can participate in consensus mechanisms. 

- **[GRANDPA](#grandpa)**: The authorities vote on chains they consider final.
- **[Blind Assignment of Blockchain Extension](#blind-assignment-of-blockchain-extension-babe) (BABE)**: The authorities are also [block authors](#block-author).

Authority sets can be used as a basis for consensus mechanisms such as the [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos) protocol.

## Authority Round (Aura)

A deterministic [consensus](#consensus) protocol where block production is limited to a rotating list of [authorities](#authority) that take turns creating blocks. In authority round (Aura) consensus, most online authorities are assumed to be honest. It is often used in combination with [GRANDPA](#grandpa) as a [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus) protocol.

Learn more by reading the official [Aura consensus algorithm](https://openethereum.github.io/Aura){target=\_blank} wiki article.

## Blind Assignment of Blockchain Extension (BABE)

A [block authoring](#block-author) protocol similar to [Aura](#authority-round-aura), except [authorities](#authority) win [slots](#slot) based on a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) instead of the round-robin selection method. The winning authority can select a chain and submit a new block.

Learn more by reading the official Web3 Foundation [BABE research document](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/protocols/block-production/Babe){target=\_blank}.

## Block Author

The node responsible for the creation of a block, also called _block producers_. In a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, these nodes are called _miners_.

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

The ability of a distributed computer network to remain operational if a certain proportion of its nodes or [authorities](#authority) are defective or behaving maliciously. A distributed network is typically considered Byzantine fault tolerant if it can remain functional, with up to one-third of nodes assumed to be defective, offline, actively malicious, and part of a coordinated attack.

### Byzantine Failure

The loss of a network service due to node failures that exceed the proportion of nodes required to reach consensus.

### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)

An early approach to Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) systems tolerate Byzantine behavior from up to one-third of participants.

The communication overhead for such systems is `O(n²)`, where `n` is the number of nodes (participants) in the system.

### Preimage

A preimage is the data that is input into a hash function to calculate a hash. Since a hash function is a [one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function){target=\_blank}, the output, the hash, cannot be used to reveal the input, the preimage.

## Call

In the context of pallets containing functions to be dispatched to the runtime, `Call` is an enumeration data type that describes the functions that can be dispatched with one variant per pallet. A `Call` represents a [dispatch](#dispatchable) data structure object.

## Chain Specification 

A chain specification file defines the properties required to run a node in an active or new Polkadot SDK-built network. It often contains the initial genesis runtime code, network properties (such as the network's name), the initial state for some pallets, and the boot node list. The chain specification file makes it easy to use a single Polkadot SDK codebase as the foundation for multiple independently configured chains.

## Collator

An [author](#block-author) of a [parachain](#parachain) network.
They aren't [authorities](#authority) in themselves, as they require a [relay chain](#relay-chain) to coordinate [consensus](#consensus).

More details are found on the [Polkadot Collator Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-collator/){target=\_blank}.

## Collective

Most often used to refer to an instance of the Collective pallet on Polkadot SDK-based networks such as [Kusama](#kusama) or [Polkadot](#polkadot) if the Collective pallet is part of the FRAME-based runtime for the network.

## Consensus

Consensus is the process blockchain nodes use to agree on a chain's canonical fork. It is composed of [authorship](#block-author), finality, and [fork-choice rule](#fork-choice-rulestrategy). In the Polkadot ecosystem, these three components are usually separate and the term consensus often refers specifically to authorship.

See also [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus).

## Consensus Algorithm

Ensures a set of [actors](#authority)—who don't necessarily trust each other—can reach an agreement about the state as the result of some computation. Most consensus algorithms assume that up to one-third of the actors or nodes can be [Byzantine fault tolerant](#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft).

Consensus algorithms are generally concerned with ensuring two properties:

- **Safety**: Indicating that all honest nodes eventually agreed on the state of the chain.
- **Liveness**: Indicating the ability of the chain to keep progressing.

## Consensus Engine

The node subsystem responsible for consensus tasks.

For detailed information about the consensus strategies of the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network, see the [Polkadot Consensus](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank} blog series.

See also [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus).

## Coretime

The time allocated for utilizing a core, measured in relay chain blocks. There are two types of coretime: *on-demand* and *bulk*.

On-demand coretime refers to coretime acquired through bidding in near real-time for the validation of a single parachain block on one of the cores reserved specifically for on-demand orders. They are available as an on-demand coretime pool. Set of cores that are available on-demand. Cores reserved through bulk coretime could also be made available in the on-demand coretime pool, in parts or in entirety.

Bulk coretime is a fixed duration of continuous coretime represented by an NFT that can be split, shared, or resold. It is managed by the [Broker pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## Development Phrase

A [mnemonic phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic#For_numerical_sequences_and_mathematical_operations){target=\_blank} that is intentionally made public.

Well-known development accounts, such as Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve, and Ferdie, are generated from the same secret phrase:

```
bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk
```

Many tools in the Polkadot SDK ecosystem, such as [`subkey`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/polkadot-stable2506-2/substrate/bin/utils/subkey){target=\_blank}, allow you to implicitly specify an account using a derivation path such as `//Alice`.

## Digest

An extensible field of the [block header](#header) that encodes information needed by several actors in a blockchain network, including:

- [Light clients](#light-client) for chain synchronization.
- Consensus engines for block verification.
- The runtime itself, in the case of pre-runtime digests.

## Dispatchable

Function objects that act as the entry points in FRAME [pallets](#pallet). Internal or external entities can call them to interact with the blockchain’s state. They are a core aspect of the runtime logic, handling [transactions](#transaction) and other state-changing operations.

## Events

A means of recording that some particular [state](#state) transition happened.

In the context of [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities), events are composable data types that each [pallet](#pallet) can individually define. Events in FRAME are implemented as a set of transient storage items inspected immediately after a block has been executed and reset during block initialization.

## Executor

A means of executing a function call in a given [runtime](#runtime) with a set of dependencies.
There are two orchestration engines in Polkadot SDK, _WebAssembly_ and _native_.

- The _native executor_ uses a natively compiled runtime embedded in the node to execute calls. This is a performance optimization available to up-to-date nodes.

- The _WebAssembly executor_ uses a [Wasm](#webassembly-wasm) binary and a Wasm interpreter to execute calls. The binary is guaranteed to be up-to-date regardless of the version of the blockchain node because it is persisted in the [state](#state) of the Polkadot SDK-based chain.

## Existential Deposit

The minimum balance an account is allowed to have in the [Balances pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/index.html){target=\_blank}. Accounts cannot be created with a balance less than the existential deposit amount. 

If an account balance drops below this amount, the Balances pallet uses [a FRAME System API](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.dec_ref){target=\_blank} to drop its references to that account.

If the Balances pallet reference to an account is dropped, the account can be [reaped](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.allow_death){target=\_blank}.

## Extrinsic

A general term for data that originates outside the runtime, is included in a block, and leads to some action. This includes user-initiated transactions and inherent transactions placed into the block by the block builder.

It is a SCALE-encoded array typically consisting of a version number, signature, and varying data types indicating the resulting runtime function to be called. Extrinsics can take two forms: [inherents](#inherent-transactions) and [transactions](#transaction). 

For more technical details, see the [Polkadot spec](https://spec.polkadot.network/id-extrinsics){target=\_blank}.

## Fork Choice Rule/Strategy

A fork choice rule or strategy helps determine which chain is valid when reconciling several network forks. A common fork choice rule is the [longest chain](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/struct.LongestChain.html){target=\_blank}, in which the chain with the most blocks is selected.

## FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)

Enables developers to create blockchain [runtime](#runtime) environments from a modular set of components called [pallets](#pallet). It utilizes a set of procedural macros to construct runtimes.

[Visit the Polkadot SDK docs for more details on FRAME.](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html){target=\_blank}

## Full Node

A node that prunes historical states, keeping only recently finalized block states to reduce storage needs. Full nodes provide current chain state access and allow direct submission and validation of [extrinsics](#extrinsic), maintaining network decentralization.

## Genesis Configuration

A mechanism for specifying the initial state of a blockchain. By convention, this initial state or first block is commonly referred to as the genesis state or genesis block. The genesis configuration for Polkadot SDK-based chains is accomplished by way of a [chain specification](#chain-specification) file.

## GRANDPA

A deterministic finality mechanism for blockchains that is implemented in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language.

The [formal specification](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa-old.pdf){target=\_blank} is maintained by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/){target=\_blank}.

## Header

A structure that aggregates the information used to summarize a block. Primarily, it consists of cryptographic information used by [light clients](#light-client) to get minimally secure but very efficient chain synchronization.

## Hybrid Consensus

A blockchain consensus protocol that consists of independent or loosely coupled mechanisms for [block production](#block-author) and finality.

Hybrid consensus allows the chain to grow as fast as probabilistic consensus protocols, such as [Aura](#authority-round-aura), while maintaining the same level of security as deterministic finality consensus protocols, such as [GRANDPA](#grandpa).

## Inherent Transactions

A special type of unsigned transaction, referred to as _inherents_, that enables a block authoring node to insert information that doesn't require validation directly into a block.

Only the block-authoring node that calls the inherent transaction function can insert data into its block. In general, validators assume the data inserted using an inherent transaction is valid and reasonable even if it can't be deterministically verified.

## JSON-RPC

A stateless, lightweight remote procedure call protocol encoded in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON-RPC provides a standard way to call functions on a remote system by using JSON.

For Polkadot SDK, this protocol is implemented through the [Parity JSON-RPC](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpc){target=\_blank} crate.

## Keystore

A subsystem for managing keys for the purpose of producing new blocks.

## Kusama

[Kusama](https://kusama.network/){target=\_blank} is a Polkadot SDK-based blockchain that implements a design similar to the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network.

Kusama is a [canary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine){target=\_blank} network and is referred to as [Polkadot's "wild cousin."](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-comparisons-kusama/){target=\_blank}.

As a canary network, Kusama is expected to be more stable than a test network like [Westend](#westend) but less stable than a production network like [Polkadot](#polkadot). Kusama is controlled by its network participants and is intended to be stable enough to encourage meaningful experimentation.

## libp2p

A peer-to-peer networking stack that allows the use of many transport mechanisms, including WebSockets (usable in a web browser).

Polkadot SDK uses the [Rust implementation](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p){target=\_blank} of the `libp2p` networking stack.

## Light Client

A type of blockchain node that doesn't store the [chain state](#state) or produce blocks.

A light client can verify cryptographic primitives and provides a [remote procedure call (RPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call){target=\_blank} server, enabling blockchain users to interact with the network.

## Metadata

Data that provides information about one or more aspects of a system.
The metadata that exposes information about a Polkadot SDK blockchain enables you to interact with that system.

## Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)

A method for determining [validators](#validator) or _[authorities](#authority)_ based on a willingness to commit their stake to the proper functioning of one or more block-producing nodes.

## Oracle

An entity that connects a blockchain to a non-blockchain data source. Oracles enable the blockchain to access and act upon information from existing data sources and incorporate data from non-blockchain systems and services.

## Origin

A [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities) primitive that identifies the source of a [dispatched](#dispatchable) function call into the [runtime](#runtime). The FRAME System pallet defines three built-in [origins](#origin). As a [pallet](#pallet) developer, you can also define custom origins, such as those defined by the [Collective pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_collective/enum.RawOrigin.html){target=\_blank}.

## Pallet

A module that can be used to extend the capabilities of a [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities)-based [runtime](#runtime).
Pallets bundle domain-specific logic with runtime primitives like [events](#events) and [storage items](#storage-item).

## Parachain

A parachain is a blockchain that derives shared infrastructure and security from a _[relay chain](#relay-chain)_.
You can learn more about parachains on the [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-parachains/){target=\_blank}.

## Paseo

Paseo TestNet provisions testing on Polkadot's "production" runtime, which means less chance of feature or code mismatch when developing parachain apps. Specifically, after the [Polkadot Technical fellowship](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship/){target=\_blank} proposes a runtime upgrade for Polkadot, this TestNet is updated, giving a period where the TestNet will be ahead of Polkadot to allow for testing.

## Polkadot

The [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.com/){target=\_blank} is a blockchain that serves as the central hub of a heterogeneous blockchain network. It serves the role of the [relay chain](#relay-chain) and provides shared infrastructure and security to support [parachains](#parachain).

## Polkadot Cloud

Polkadot Cloud is a platform for deploying resilient, customizable and scalable Web3 applications through Polkadot's functionality. It encompasses the wider Polkadot network infrastructure and security layer where parachains operate. The platform enables users to launch Ethereum-compatible chains, build specialized blockchains, and flexibly manage computing resources through on-demand or bulk coretime purchases. Initially launched with basic parachain functionality, Polkadot Cloud has evolved to offer enhanced flexibility with features like coretime, elastic scaling, and async backing for improved performance.

## Polkadot Hub

Polkadot Hub is a Layer 1 platform that serves as the primary entry point to the Polkadot ecosystem, providing essential functionality without requiring parachain deployment. It offers core services including smart contracts, identity management, staking, governance, and interoperability with other ecosystems, making it simple and fast for both builders and users to get started in Web3.

## PolkaVM

PolkaVM is a custom virtual machine optimized for performance, leveraging a RISC-V-based architecture to support Solidity and any language that compiles to RISC-V. It is specifically designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling smart contract deployment and execution.

## Relay Chain

Relay chains are blockchains that provide shared infrastructure and security to the [parachains](#parachain) in the network. In addition to providing [consensus](#consensus) capabilities, relay chains allow parachains to communicate and exchange digital assets without needing to trust one another.

## Rococo

A [parachain](#parachain) test network for the Polkadot network. The [Rococo](#rococo) network is a Polkadot SDK-based blockchain with an October 14, 2024 deprecation date. Development teams are encouraged to use the Paseo TestNet instead.

## Runtime

The runtime represents the [state transition function](#state-transition-function-stf) for a blockchain. In Polkadot SDK, the runtime is stored as a [Wasm](#webassembly-wasm) binary in the chain state. The Runtime is stored under a unique state key and can be modified during the execution of the state transition function.

## Slot

A fixed, equal interval of time used by consensus engines such as [Aura](#authority-round-aura) and [BABE](#blind-assignment-of-blockchain-extension-babe). In each slot, a subset of [authorities](#authority) is permitted, or obliged, to [author](#block-author) a block.

## Sovereign Account

The unique account identifier for each chain in the relay chain ecosystem. It is often used in cross-consensus (XCM) interactions to sign XCM messages sent to the relay chain or other chains in the ecosystem.

The sovereign account for each chain is a root-level account that can only be accessed using the Sudo pallet or through governance. The account identifier is calculated by concatenating the Blake2 hash of a specific text string and the registered parachain identifier.

## SS58 Address Format

A public key address based on the Bitcoin [`Base-58-check`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding){target=\_blank} encoding. Each Polkadot SDK SS58 address uses a `base-58` encoded value to identify a specific account on a specific Polkadot SDK-based chain

The [canonical `ss58-registry`](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry){target=\_blank} provides additional details about the address format used by different Polkadot SDK-based chains, including the network prefix and website used for different networks

## State Transition Function (STF)

The logic of a blockchain that determines how the state changes when a block is processed. In Polkadot SDK, the state transition function is effectively equivalent to the [runtime](#runtime).

## Storage Item

[FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities) primitives that provide type-safe data persistence capabilities to the [runtime](#runtime).
Learn more in the [storage items](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/storage/types/index.html){target=\_blank} reference document in the Polkadot SDK.

## Substrate

A flexible framework for building modular, efficient, and upgradeable blockchains. Substrate is written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language and is maintained by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/){target=\_blank}.

## Transaction

An [extrinsic](#extrinsic) that includes a signature that can be used to verify the account authorizing it inherently or via [signed extensions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/signed_extensions/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## Transaction Era

A definable period expressed as a range of block numbers during which a transaction can be included in a block.
Transaction eras are used to protect against transaction replay attacks if an account is reaped and its replay-protecting nonce is reset to zero.

## Trie (Patricia Merkle Tree)

A data structure used to represent sets of key-value pairs and enables the items in the data set to be stored and retrieved using a cryptographic hash. Because incremental changes to the data set result in a new hash, retrieving data is efficient even if the data set is very large. With this data structure, you can also prove whether the data set includes any particular key-value pair without access to the entire data set.

In Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, state is stored in a trie data structure that supports the efficient creation of incremental digests. This trie is exposed to the [runtime](#runtime) as [a simple key/value map](#storage-item) where both keys and values can be arbitrary byte arrays.

## Validator

A validator is a node that participates in the consensus mechanism of the network. Its roles include block production, transaction validation, network integrity, and security maintenance.

## WebAssembly (Wasm)

An execution architecture that allows for the efficient, platform-neutral expression of
deterministic, machine-executable logic.

[Wasm](https://webassembly.org/){target=\_blank} can be compiled from many languages, including
the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language. Polkadot SDK-based chains use a Wasm binary to provide portable [runtimes](#runtime) that can be included as part of the chain's state.

## Weight

A convention used in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains to measure and manage the time it takes to validate a block.
Polkadot SDK defines one unit of weight as one picosecond of execution time on reference hardware.

The maximum block weight should be equivalent to one-third of the target block time with an allocation of one-third each for:

- Block construction
- Network propagation
- Import and verification

By defining weights, you can trade-off the number of transactions per second and the hardware required to maintain the target block time appropriate for your use case. Weights are defined in the runtime, meaning you can tune them using runtime updates to keep up with hardware and software improvements.

## Westend

Westend is a Parity-maintained, Polkadot SDK-based blockchain that serves as a test network for the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network.

Page Title: Interact with Precompiles

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/develop-smart-contracts-precompiles-interact-with-precompiles.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/interact-with-precompiles/
- Summary: Learn how to interact with Polkadot Hub’s precompiles from Solidity to access native, low-level functions like hashing, pairing, EC ops, etc.

# Interact with Precompiles

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Precompiles offer Polkadot Hub developers access to high-performance native functions directly from their smart contracts. Each precompile has a specific address and accepts a particular input data format. When called correctly, they execute optimized, native implementations of commonly used functions much more efficiently than equivalent contract-based implementations.

This guide demonstrates how to interact with each standard precompile available in Polkadot Hub through Solidity smart contracts.

## Basic Precompile Interaction Pattern

All precompiles follow a similar interaction pattern:

```solidity
// Generic pattern for calling precompiles
function callPrecompile(address precompileAddress, bytes memory input)
    internal
    returns (bool success, bytes memory result)
{
    // Direct low-level call to the precompile address
    (success, result) = precompileAddress.call(input);

    // Ensure the call was successful
    require(success, "Precompile call failed");

    return (success, result);
}
```

Feel free to check the [`precompiles-hardhat`](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/tree/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat){target=\_blank} repository to check all the precompiles examples. The repository contains a set of example contracts and test files demonstrating how to interact with each precompile in Polkadot Hub.

Now, you'll explore how to use each precompile available in Polkadot Hub.

## ECRecover (0x01)

ECRecover recovers an Ethereum address associated with the public key used to sign a message.

```solidity title="ECRecover.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ECRecoverExample {
    event ECRecovered(bytes result);

    // Address of the ECRecover precompile
    address constant EC_RECOVER_ADDRESS = address(0x01);
    bytes public result;

    function callECRecover(bytes calldata input) public {
        bool success;
        bytes memory resultInMemory;

        (success, resultInMemory) = EC_RECOVER_ADDRESS.call{value: 0}(input);

        if (success) {
            emit ECRecovered(resultInMemory);
        }

        result = resultInMemory;
    }

    function getRecoveredAddress() public view returns (address) {
        require(result.length == 32, "Invalid result length");
        return address(uint160(uint256(bytes32(result))));
    }
}
```

To interact with the ECRecover precompile, you can deploy the `ECRecoverExample` contract in [Remix](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank} or any Solidity-compatible environment. The `callECRecover` function takes a 128-byte input combining the message `hash`, `v`, `r`, and `s` signature values. Check this [test file](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/blob/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat/test/ECRecover.js){target=\_blank} that shows how to format this input and verify that the recovered address matches the expected result.

## SHA-256 (0x02)

The SHA-256 precompile computes the SHA-256 hash of the input data.

```solidity title="SHA256.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SHA256Example {
    event SHA256Called(bytes result);

    // Address of the SHA256 precompile
    address constant SHA256_PRECOMPILE = address(0x02);

    bytes public result;

    function callH256(bytes calldata input) public {
        bool success;
        bytes memory resultInMemory;

        (success, resultInMemory) = SHA256_PRECOMPILE.call{value: 0}(input);

        if (success) {
            emit SHA256Called(resultInMemory);
        }

        result = resultInMemory;
    }
}
```

To use it, you can deploy the `SHA256Example` contract in [Remix](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank} or any Solidity-compatible environment and call callH256 with arbitrary bytes. Check out this [test file](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/blob/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat/test/SHA256.js){target=\_blank} shows how to pass a UTF-8 string, hash it using the precompile, and compare it with the expected hash from Node.js's [crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js){target=\_blank} module.

## RIPEMD-160 (0x03)

The RIPEMD-160 precompile computes the RIPEMD-160 hash of the input data.

```solidity title="RIPEMD160.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract RIPEMD160Example {
    // RIPEMD-160 precompile address
    address constant RIPEMD160_PRECOMPILE = address(0x03);

    bytes32 public result;

    event RIPEMD160Called(bytes32 result);

    function calculateRIPEMD160(bytes calldata input) public returns (bytes32) {
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = RIPEMD160_PRECOMPILE.call(
            input
        );
        require(success, "RIPEMD-160 precompile call failed");
        // return full 32 bytes, no assembly extraction
        bytes32 fullHash;
        assembly {
            fullHash := mload(add(returnData, 32))
        }
        result = fullHash;
        emit RIPEMD160Called(fullHash);
        return fullHash;
    }
}
```

To use it, you can deploy the `RIPEMD160Example` contract in [Remix](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank} or any Solidity-compatible environment and call `calculateRIPEMD160` with arbitrary bytes. This [test file](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/blob/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat/test/RIPEMD160.js){target=\_blank} shows how to hash a UTF-8 string, pad the 20-byte result to 32 bytes, and verify it against the expected output.

## Identity (Data Copy) (0x04)

The Identity precompile simply returns the input data as output. While seemingly trivial, it can be useful for testing and certain specialized scenarios.

```solidity title="Identity.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IdentityExample {
    event IdentityCalled(bytes result);

    // Address of the Identity precompile
    address constant IDENTITY_PRECOMPILE = address(0x04);

    bytes public result;

    function callIdentity(bytes calldata input) public {
        bool success;
        bytes memory resultInMemory;

        (success, resultInMemory) = IDENTITY_PRECOMPILE.call(input);

        if (success) {
            emit IdentityCalled(resultInMemory);
        }

        result = resultInMemory;
    }
}
```

To use it, you can deploy the `IdentityExample` contract in [Remix](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank} or any Solidity-compatible environment and call `callIdentity` with arbitrary bytes. This [test file](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/blob/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat/test/Identity.js){target=\_blank} shows how to pass input data and verify that the precompile returns it unchanged.

## Modular Exponentiation (0x05)

The ModExp precompile performs modular exponentiation, which is an operation commonly needed in cryptographic algorithms.

```solidity title="ModExp.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ModExpExample {
    address constant MODEXP_ADDRESS = address(0x05);

    function modularExponentiation(
        bytes memory base,
        bytes memory exponent,
        bytes memory modulus
    ) public view returns (bytes memory) {
        bytes memory input = abi.encodePacked(
            toBytes32(base.length),
            toBytes32(exponent.length),
            toBytes32(modulus.length),
            base,
            exponent,
            modulus
        );

        (bool success, bytes memory result) = MODEXP_ADDRESS.staticcall(input);
        require(success, "ModExp precompile call failed");

        return result;
    }

    function toBytes32(uint256 value) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return bytes32(value);
    }
}
```

To use it, you can deploy the `ModExpExample` contract in [Remix](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank} or any Solidity-compatible environment and call `modularExponentiation` with encoded `base`, `exponent`, and `modulus` bytes. This [test file](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/blob/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat/test/ModExp.js){target=\_blank} shows how to test modular exponentiation like (4 ** 13) % 497 = 445.

## BN128 Addition (0x06)

The BN128Add precompile performs addition on the alt_bn128 elliptic curve, which is essential for zk-SNARK operations.

```solidity title="BN128Add.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract BN128AddExample {
    address constant BN128_ADD_PRECOMPILE = address(0x06);

    event BN128Added(uint256 x3, uint256 y3);

    uint256 public resultX;
    uint256 public resultY;

    function callBN128Add(uint256 x1, uint256 y1, uint256 x2, uint256 y2) public {
        bytes memory input = abi.encodePacked(
            bytes32(x1), bytes32(y1), bytes32(x2), bytes32(y2)
        );

        bool success;
        bytes memory output;

        (success, output) = BN128_ADD_PRECOMPILE.call{value: 0}(input);

        require(success, "BN128Add precompile call failed");
        require(output.length == 64, "Invalid output length");

        (uint256 x3, uint256 y3) = abi.decode(output, (uint256, uint256));

        resultX = x3;
        resultY = y3;

        emit BN128Added(x3, y3);
    }
}
```

To use it, you can deploy the `BN128AddExample` contract in [Remix](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank} or any Solidity-compatible environment and call `callBN128Add` with valid `alt_bn128` points. This [test file](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/blob/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat/test/BN128Add.js){target=\_blank} demonstrates a valid curve addition and checks the result against known expected values.

## BN128 Scalar Multiplication (0x07)

The BN128Mul precompile performs scalar multiplication on the alt_bn128 curve.

```solidity title="BN128Mul.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BN128MulExample {
    // Precompile address for BN128Mul
    address constant BN128_MUL_ADDRESS = address(0x07);

    bytes public result;

    // Performs scalar multiplication of a point on the alt_bn128 curve
    function bn128ScalarMul(uint256 x1, uint256 y1, uint256 scalar) public {
        // Format: [x, y, scalar] - each 32 bytes
        bytes memory input = abi.encodePacked(
            bytes32(x1),
            bytes32(y1),
            bytes32(scalar)
        );

        (bool success, bytes memory resultInMemory) = BN128_MUL_ADDRESS.call{
            value: 0
        }(input);
        require(success, "BN128Mul precompile call failed");

        result = resultInMemory;
    }

    // Helper to decode result from `result` storage
    function getResult() public view returns (uint256 x2, uint256 y2) {
        bytes memory tempResult = result;
        require(tempResult.length >= 64, "Invalid result length");
        assembly {
            x2 := mload(add(tempResult, 32))
            y2 := mload(add(tempResult, 64))
        }
    }
}
```

To use it, deploy `BN128MulExample` in [Remix](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank} or any Solidity-compatible environment and call `bn128ScalarMul` with a valid point and scalar. This [test file](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkavm-hardhat-examples/blob/v0.0.3/precompiles-hardhat/test/BN128Mul.js){target=\_blank} shows how to test the operation and verify the expected scalar multiplication result on `alt_bn128`.

## BN128 Pairing Check (0x08)

    // Performs a pairing check on the alt_bn128 curve
    function bn128Pairing(bytes memory input) public {
        // Call the precompile
        (bool success, bytes memory resultInMemory) = BN128_PAIRING_ADDRESS
            .call{value: 0}(input);
        require(success, "BN128Pairing precompile call failed");

        result = resultInMemory;
    }

    // Helper function to decode the result from `result` storage
    function getResult() public view returns (bool isValid) {
        bytes memory tempResult = result;
        require(tempResult.length == 32, "Invalid result length");

        uint256 output;
        assembly {
            output := mload(add(tempResult, 32))
        }

        isValid = (output == 1);
    }
}
```

## Blake2F (0x09)

The Blake2F precompile performs the Blake2 compression function F, which is the core of the Blake2 hash function.

```solidity title="Blake2F.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Blake2FExample {

        bytes memory input = abi.encodePacked(rounds);

        // Add state vector h (8 * 32 = 256 bytes)
        for (uint i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            input = abi.encodePacked(input, h[i]);
        }

        // Add message block m (16 * 32 = 512 bytes, but we need to convert to 16 * 8 = 128 bytes)
        // Blake2F expects 64-bit words in little-endian format
        for (uint i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
            // Take only the first 8 bytes of each bytes32 and reverse for little-endian
            bytes8 word = bytes8(m[i]);
            input = abi.encodePacked(input, word);

- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/

# XCM Precompile

## Introduction

The [XCM (Cross-Consensus Message)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm){target=\_blank} precompile enables Polkadot Hub developers to access XCM functionality directly from their smart contracts using a Solidity interface.

Located at the fixed address `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a0000`, the XCM precompile offers three primary functions:

- **`execute`**: For local XCM execution.
- **`send`**: For cross-chain message transmission.
- **`weighMessage`**: For cost estimation.

This guide demonstrates how to interact with the XCM precompile through Solidity smart contracts using [Remix IDE](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank}.

!!!note
    The XCM precompile provides the barebones XCM functionality. While it provides a lot of flexibility, it doesn't provide abstractions to hide away XCM details. These have to be built on top.

## Precompile Interface

The XCM precompile implements the `IXcm` interface, which defines the structure for interacting with XCM functionality. The source code for the interface is as follows:

```solidity title="IXcm.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

/// @dev The on-chain address of the XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) precompile.
address constant XCM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS = address(0xA0000);

/// @title XCM Precompile Interface
/// @notice A low-level interface for interacting with `pallet_xcm`.
/// It forwards calls directly to the corresponding dispatchable functions,
/// providing access to XCM execution and message passing.
/// @dev Documentation:
/// @dev - XCM: https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/interoperability
/// @dev - SCALE codec: https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/data-encoding
/// @dev - Weights: https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/blocks-transactions-fees/fees/#transactions-weights-and-fees
interface IXcm {
    /// @notice Weight v2 used for measurement for an XCM execution
    struct Weight {
        /// @custom:property The computational time used to execute some logic based on reference hardware.
        uint64 refTime;
        /// @custom:property The size of the proof needed to execute some logic.
        uint64 proofSize;
    }

    /// @notice Executes an XCM message locally on the current chain with the caller's origin.
    /// @dev Internally calls `pallet_xcm::execute`.
    /// @param message A SCALE-encoded Versioned XCM message.
    /// @param weight The maximum allowed `Weight` for execution.
    /// @dev Call @custom:function weighMessage(message) to ensure sufficient weight allocation.
    function execute(bytes calldata message, Weight calldata weight) external;

    /// @notice Sends an XCM message to another parachain or consensus system.
    /// @dev Internally calls `pallet_xcm::send`.
    /// @param destination SCALE-encoded destination MultiLocation.
    /// @param message SCALE-encoded Versioned XCM message.
    function send(bytes calldata destination, bytes calldata message) external;

    /// @notice Estimates the `Weight` required to execute a given XCM message.
    /// @param message SCALE-encoded Versioned XCM message to analyze.
    /// @return weight Struct containing estimated `refTime` and `proofSize`.
    function weighMessage(bytes calldata message) external view returns (Weight memory weight);
}
```

The interface defines a `Weight` struct that represents the computational cost of XCM operations. Weight has two components: 

- **`refTime`**: Computational time on reference hardware.
- **`proofSize`**: The size of the proof required for execution.

All XCM messages must be encoded using the [SCALE codec](/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/data-encoding/#data-encoding){target=\_blank}, Polkadot's standard serialization format.

For further information, check the [`precompiles/IXCM.sol`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/cb629d46ebf00aa65624013a61f9c69ebf02b0b4/polkadot/xcm/pallet-xcm/src/precompiles/IXcm.sol){target=\_blank} file present in `pallet-xcm`.

## Interact with the XCM Precompile

To interact with the XCM precompile, you can use the precompile interface directly in [Remix IDE](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix/){target=\_blank}:

1. Create a new file called `IXcm.sol` in Remix.
2. Copy and paste the `IXcm` interface code into the file.
3. Compile the interface by selecting the button or using **Ctrl +S** keys:

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/xcm-precompile-01.webp)

4. In the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select the `IXcm` interface from the contract dropdown.
5. Enter the precompile address `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a0000` in the **At Address** input field.
6. Select the **At Address** button to connect to the precompile.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/xcm-precompile-02.webp)

7. Once connected, you can use the Remix interface to interact with the XCM precompile's  `execute`, `send`, and `weighMessage` functions.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/xcm-precompile-03.webp)

The main entrypoint of the precompile is the `execute` function. However, it's necessary to first call `weighMessage` to fill in the required parameters.

### Weigh a Message

The `weighMessage` function estimates the computational cost required to execute an XCM message. This estimate is crucial for understanding the resources needed before actually executing or sending a message.

To test this functionality in Remix, you can call `callWeighMessage` with a SCALE-encoded XCM message. For example, for testing, you can use the following encoded XCM message:

```text title="encoded-xcm-message-example"
0x050c000401000003008c86471301000003008c8647000d010101000000010100368e8759910dab756d344995f1d3c79374ca8f70066d3a709e48029f6bf0ee7e
```

![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/xcm-precompile-04.webp)

This encoded message represents a sequence of XCM instructions:

- **[Withdraw Asset](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#withdrawasset){target=\_blank}**: This instruction removes assets from the local chain's sovereign account or the caller's account, making them available for use in subsequent XCM instructions.
- **[Buy Execution](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#buyexecution){target=\_blank}**: This instruction purchases execution time on the destination chain using the withdrawn assets, ensuring the message can be processed.
- **[Deposit Asset](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#depositasset){target=\_blank}**: This instruction deposits the remaining assets into a specified account on the destination chain after execution costs have been deducted.

This encoded message is provided as an example. You can craft your own XCM message tailored to your specific use case as needed.

The function returns a `Weight` struct containing `refTime` and `proofSize` values, which indicate the estimated computational cost of executing this message. If successful, after calling the `callWeighMessage` function, you should see the `refTime` and `proofSize` of the message:

![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/xcm-precompile-05.webp)

!!!note
    You can find many more examples of XCMs in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/franciscoaguirre/a6dea0c55e81faba65bedf700033a1a2){target=\_blank}, which connects to the Polkadot Hub TestNet.

### Execute a Message

The `execute` function runs an XCM message locally using the caller's origin.
This function is the main entrypoint to cross-chain interactions.

Follow these steps to execute a message:

1. Call `weighMessage` with your message to get the required weight.
2. Pass the same message bytes and the weight obtained from the previous step to `execute`.
For example, using the same message from the weighing example, you would call `execute` with:

    - **`message`**: The encoded XCM message bytes.
    - **`weight`**: The `Weight` struct returned from `weighMessage`.

    You can use the [papi console](https://dev.papi.how/extrinsics#networkId=localhost&endpoint=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-passet-hub.polkadot.io&data=0x1f03050c000401000003008c86471301000003008c8647000d010101000000010100368e8759910dab756d344995f1d3c79374ca8f70066d3a709e48029f6bf0ee7e0750c61e2901daad0600){target=\_blank} to examine the complete extrinsic structure for this operation.

3. On Remix, click on the **Transact** button to execute the XCM message:
  
    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/xcm-precompile-06.webp)

    If successful, you will see the following output in the Remix terminal:

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm-precompile/xcm-precompile-07.webp)

Additionally, you can verify that the execution of this specific message was successful by checking that the beneficiary account associated with the XCM message has received the funds accordingly.

### Send a Message

While most cross-chain operations can be performed via `execute`, `send` is sometimes necessary, for example, when opening HRMP channels.

To send a message:

1. Prepare your destination location encoded in XCM format.
2. Prepare your XCM message (similar to the execute example).
3. Call `send` with both parameters.

The destination parameter must be encoded according to XCM's location format, specifying the target parachain or consensus system. The message parameter contains the XCM instructions to be executed on the destination chain.

Unlike `execute`, the `send` function doesn't require a weight parameter since the destination chain will handle execution costs according to its fee structure.

## Cross Contract Calls

Beyond direct interaction and wrapper contracts, you can integrate XCM functionality directly into your existing smart contracts by inheriting from or importing the `IXcm` interface. This approach enables you to embed cross-chain capabilities into your application logic seamlessly.

Whether you're building DeFi protocols, governance systems, or any application requiring cross-chain coordination, you can incorporate XCM calls directly within your contract's functions.

## Conclusion

The XCM precompile provides a simple yet powerful interface for cross-chain interactions within the Polkadot ecosystem and beyond.
By building and executing XCM programs, developers can build cross-chain applications that leverage the full potential of Polkadot's interoperability features.

## Next steps

Head to the Polkadot Hub TestNet and start playing around with the precompile using Hardhat or Foundry.

You can use PAPI to build XCM programs and test them with Chopsticks.

# Introduction to XCM

## Introduction

Polkadot’s unique value lies in its ability to enable interoperability between parachains and other blockchain systems. At the core of this capability is XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging)—a flexible messaging format that facilitates communication and collaboration between independent consensus systems.

With XCM, one chain can send intents to another one, fostering a more interconnected ecosystem. Although it was developed specifically for Polkadot, XCM is a universal format, usable in any blockchain environment. This guide provides an overview of XCM’s core principles, design, and functionality, alongside practical examples of its implementation.

## Messaging Format

XCM is not a protocol but a standardized [messaging format](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format){target=\_blank}. It defines the structure and behavior of messages but does not handle their delivery. This separation allows developers to focus on crafting instructions for target systems without worrying about transmission mechanics.

XCM messages are intent-driven, outlining desired actions for the receiving blockchain to consider and potentially alter its state. These messages do not directly execute changes; instead, they rely on the host chain's environment to interpret and implement them. By utilizing asynchronous composability, XCM facilitates efficient execution where messages can be processed independently of their original order, similar to how RESTful services handle HTTP requests without requiring sequential processing.

## The Four Principles of XCM

XCM adheres to four guiding principles that ensure robust and reliable communication across consensus systems:

- **Asynchronous**: XCM messages operate independently of sender acknowledgment, avoiding delays due to blocked processes.
- **Absolute**: XCM messages are guaranteed to be delivered and interpreted accurately, in order, and timely. Once a message is sent, one can be sure it will be processed as intended.
- **Asymmetric**: XCM messages follow the 'fire and forget' paradigm meaning no automatic feedback is provided to the sender. Any results must be communicated separately to the sender with an additional message back to the origin.
- **Agnostic**: XCM operates independently of the specific consensus mechanisms, making it compatible across diverse systems.

These principles guarantee that XCM provides a reliable framework for cross-chain communication, even in complex environments.

## The XCM Tech Stack

![Diagram of the XCM tech stack](/images/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/intro-to-xcm-01.webp)

The XCM tech stack is designed to facilitate seamless interoperable communication between chains that reside within the Polkadot ecosystem. XCM can be used to express the meaning of the messages over each of the communication channels.

## Core Functionalities of XCM

XCM enhances cross-consensus communication by introducing several powerful features:

- **Programmability**: Supports dynamic message handling, allowing for more comprehensive use cases. Includes branching logic, safe dispatches for version checks, and asset operations like NFT management.
- **Functional Multichain Decomposition**: Enables mechanisms such as remote asset locking, asset namespacing, and inter-chain state referencing, with contextual message identification.
- **Bridging**: Establishes a universal reference framework for multi-hop setups, connecting disparate systems like Ethereum and Bitcoin with the Polkadot relay chain acting as a universal location.

The standardized format for messages allows parachains to handle tasks like user balances, governance, and staking, freeing the Polkadot relay chain to focus on shared security. These features make XCM indispensable for implementing scalable and interoperable blockchain applications. 

## XCM Example

The following is a simplified XCM message demonstrating a token transfer from Alice to Bob on the same chain (ParaA).

```rust
let message = Xcm(vec![
    WithdrawAsset((Here, amount).into()),
    BuyExecution { 
        fees: (Here, amount).into(), 
        weight_limit: WeightLimit::Unlimited 
    },
    DepositAsset {
        assets: All.into(),
        beneficiary: MultiLocation {
            parents: 0,
            interior: Junction::AccountId32 {
                network: None,
                id: BOB.clone().into()
            }.into(),
        }.into()
    }
]);
```

The message consists of three instructions described as follows:

- **[WithdrawAsset](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#withdrawasset){target=\_blank}**: Transfers a specified number of tokens from Alice's account to a holding register.

    ```rust
        WithdrawAsset((Here, amount).into()),
    ```

    - **`Here`**: The native parachain token.
    - **`amount`**: The number of tokens that are transferred.

    The first instruction takes as an input the MultiAsset that should be withdrawn. The MultiAsset describes the native parachain token with the `Here` keyword. The `amount` parameter is the number of tokens that are transferred. The withdrawal account depends on the origin of the message. In this example the origin of the message is Alice. The `WithdrawAsset` instruction moves `amount` number of native tokens from Alice's account into the holding register.

- **[BuyExecution](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#buyexecution){target=\_blank}**: Allocates fees to cover the execution [weight](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight){target=\_blank} of the XCM instructions.

    ```rust
        BuyExecution { 
            fees: (Here, amount).into(), 
            weight_limit: WeightLimit::Unlimited 
        },
    ```

    - **`fees`**: Describes the asset in the holding register that should be used to pay for the weight.
    - **`weight_limit`**: Defines the maximum fees that can be used to buy weight.

- **[DepositAsset](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#depositasset){target=\_blank}**: Moves the remaining tokens from the holding register to Bob’s account.

    ```rust
        DepositAsset {
            assets: All.into(),
            beneficiary: MultiLocation {
                parents: 0,
                interior: Junction::AccountId32 {
                    network: None,
                    id: BOB.clone().into()
                }.into(),
            }.into()
        }
    ```

    - **`All`**: The wildcard for the asset(s) to be deposited. In this case, all assets in the holding register should be deposited.
    
This step-by-step process showcases how XCM enables precise state changes within a blockchain system. You can find a complete XCM message example in the [XCM repository](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-docs/blob/main/examples/src/0_first_look/mod.rs){target=\_blank}.

## Overview

XCM revolutionizes cross-chain communication by enabling use cases such as:

- Token transfers between blockchains.
- Asset locking for cross-chain smart contract interactions.
- Remote execution of functions on other blockchains.

These functionalities empower developers to build innovative, multi-chain applications, leveraging the strengths of various blockchain networks.

- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/local-development-node/
- Summary: Follow this step-by-step guide to install a Revive Dev node and ETH-RPC adapter for smart contract development in a local environment.

# Local Development Node

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

A local development node provides an isolated blockchain environment where you can deploy, test, and debug smart contracts without incurring network fees or waiting for block confirmations. This guide demonstrates how to set up a local Polkadot SDK-based node with smart contract capabilities.

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

- A running node with smart contract support.
- An ETH-RPC adapter for Ethereum-compatible tooling integration accessible at `http://localhost:8545`.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have done the following:

- Completed the [Install Polkadot SDK Dependencies](/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank} guide and successfully installed [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} and the required packages to set up your development environment.

## Install the Revive Dev Node and ETH-RPC Adapter

The Polkadot SDK repository contains both the [Revive Dev node](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/8e2b6f742a38bb13688e12abacded0aab2dbbb23/substrate/frame/revive/dev-node){target=\_blank} implementation and the [ETH-RPC adapter](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/8e2b6f742a38bb13688e12abacded0aab2dbbb23/substrate/frame/revive/rpc){target=\_blank} required for Ethereum compatibility. Start by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git
cd polkadot-sdk
git checkout 8e2b6f742a38bb13688e12abacded0aab2dbbb23
```

Next, you need to compile the two essential components for your development environment. The Substrate node provides the core blockchain runtime with smart contract support, while the ETH-RPC adapter enables Ethereum JSON-RPC compatibility for existing tooling:

```bash
cargo build -p revive-dev-node --bin revive-dev-node --release
cargo build -p pallet-revive-eth-rpc --bin eth-rpc --release
```

The compilation process may take some time depending on your system specifications, potentially up to 30 minutes. Release builds are optimized for performance but take longer to compile than debug builds. After successful compilation, you can verify the binaries are available in the `target/release` directory:

- **Revive Dev node path**: `polkadot-sdk/target/release/revive-dev-node`
- **ETH-RPC adapter path**: `polkadot-sdk/target/release/eth-rpc`

## Run the Local Node

With the binaries compiled, you can now start your local development environment. The setup requires running two processes.

Start the node first, which will initialize a local blockchain with the `dev` chain specification. This configuration includes `pallet-revive` for smart contract functionality and uses pre-funded development accounts for testing:

```bash
./target/release/revive-dev-node --dev
```

The node will begin producing blocks immediately and display initialization logs:

For debugging purposes or to monitor low-level operations, you can enable detailed logging by setting environment variables before running the command:

```bash
RUST_LOG="error,evm=debug,sc_rpc_server=info,runtime::revive=debug" ./target/release/revive-dev-node --dev
```

Once the node is running, open a new terminal window and start the ETH-RPC adapter. This component translates Ethereum JSON-RPC calls into Substrate-compatible requests, allowing you to use familiar Ethereum tools like MetaMask, Hardhat, or Ethers.js:

```bash
./target/release/eth-rpc --dev
```

You should see logs indicating that the adapter is ready to accept connections:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>

</div>

Similar to the Revive Dev node, you can enable detailed logging for the ETH-RPC adapter to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
RUST_LOG="info,eth-rpc=debug" ./target/release/eth-rpc --dev
```

Your local development environment is now active and accessible at `http://localhost:8545`. This endpoint accepts standard Ethereum JSON-RPC requests, enabling seamless integration with existing Ethereum development tools and workflows. 

You can connect wallets, deploy contracts using Remix or Hardhat, and interact with your smart contracts as you would on any Ethereum-compatible network.

# Networks

## Introduction

The Polkadot ecosystem consists of multiple networks designed to support different stages of blockchain development, from main networks to test networks. Each network serves a unique purpose, providing developers with flexible environments for building, testing, and deploying blockchain applications.

This section includes essential network information such as RPC endpoints, currency symbols and decimals, and how to acquire TestNet tokens for the Polkadot ecosystem of networks.

## Production Networks

### Polkadot

Polkadot is the primary production blockchain network for high-stakes, enterprise-grade applications. Polkadot MainNet has been running since May 2020 and has implementations in various programming languages ranging from Rust to JavaScript.

### Kusama

Kusama is a network built as a risk-taking, fast-moving "canary in the coal mine" for its cousin Polkadot. As it is built on top of the same infrastructure, Kusama often acts as a final testing ground for new features before they are launched on Polkadot. Unlike true TestNets, however, the Kusama KSM native token does have economic value. This incentive encourages participants to maintain this robust and performant structure for the benefit of the community.

# Networks

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Polkadot Hub provides smart contract functionality across multiple networks to facilitate smart contract development in the Polkadot ecosystem. Whether you're testing new contracts or deploying to production, Polkadot Hub offers several network environments tailored for each stage of development. Developers can thoroughly test, iterate, and validate their smart contracts from local testing environments to production networks like Polkadot Hub.

This guide will introduce you to the current and upcoming networks available for smart contract development and explain how they fit into the development workflow.

## Network Overview

Smart contract development on Polkadot Hub follows a structured process to ensure rigorous testing of new contracts and upgrades before deployment on production networks. Development progresses through a well-defined path, beginning with local environments, advancing through TestNets, and ultimately reaching MainNets. The diagram below illustrates this progression:

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1[Local Polkadot Hub] --> id2[TestNet Polkadot Hub] --> id4[MainNet Polkadot Hub]
```

This progression ensures developers can thoroughly test and iterate their smart contracts without risking real tokens or affecting production networks. A typical development journey consists of three main stages:

1. Local development:

    - Developers start in a local environment to create, test, and iterate on smart contracts.
    - Provides rapid experimentation in an isolated setup without external dependencies.

2. TestNet development:

    - Contracts move to TestNets like Westend Hub and Passet Hub.
    - Enables testing in simulated real-world conditions without using real tokens.

3. Production deployment:

    - Final deployment to MainNets like Kusama Hub and Polkadot Hub.
    - Represents the live environment where contracts interact with real economic value.

## Local Development

The local development environment is crucial for smart contract development on Polkadot Hub. It provides developers a controlled space for rapid testing and iteration before moving to public networks. The local setup consists of several key components:

- **[Kitchensink node](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/kitchensink_runtime/index.html){target=\_blank}**: A local node that can be run for development and testing. It includes logging capabilities for debugging contract execution and provides a pre-configured development environment with pre-funded accounts for testing purposes.
- **[Ethereum RPC proxy](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive_eth_rpc/index.html){target=\_blank}**: Bridges Ethereum-compatible tools with the Polkadot SDK-based network. It enables seamless integration with popular development tools like MetaMask and Remix IDE. The purpose of this component is to translate Ethereum RPC calls into Substrate format.

## Test Networks

The following test networks provide controlled environments for testing smart contracts. TestNet tokens are available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. They provide a stable environment for testing your contracts without using real tokens.

``` mermaid
flowchart TB
    id1[Polkadot Hub TestNets] --> id2[Passet Hub]
    id1[Polkadot Hub TestNets] --> id3[Westend Hub]
```

### Passet Hub

The Passet Hub will be a community-managed TestNet designed specifically for smart contract development. It will mirror Asset Hub's runtime and provide developers with an additional environment for testing their contracts before deployment to production networks.

### Westend Hub

Westend Hub is the TestNet for smart contract development and its cutting-edge features. The network maintains the same features and capabilities as the production Polkadot Hub, and also incorporates the latest features developed by core developers.

## Production Networks

The MainNet environments represent the final destination for thoroughly tested and validated smart contracts, where they operate with real economic value and serve actual users.

``` mermaid
flowchart TB
    id1[Polkadot Hub MainNets] --> id2[Polkadot Hub]
    id1[Polkadot Hub MainNets] --> id3[Kusama Hub]
```

### Polkadot Hub

Polkadot Hub is the primary production network for deploying smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem. It provides a secure and stable environment for running smart contracts with real economic value. The network supports PolkaVM-compatible contracts written in Solidity or Rust, maintaining compatibility with Ethereum-based development tools.

### Kusama Hub

Kusama Hub is the canary version of Polkadot Hub. It is designed for developers who want to move quickly and test their smart contracts in a real-world environment with economic incentives. It provides a more flexible space for innovation while maintaining the same core functionality as Polkadot Hub.

# Smart Contracts FAQs

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
!!! note
    For a list of known incompatibilities, please refer to the [Solidity and Yul IR translation incompatibilities](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/evm-vs-polkavm/#solidity-and-yul-ir-translation-incompatibilities){target=\_blank} section.

## General Questions

### What are the different types of smart contracts I can build on Polkadot?

Polkadot supports three main smart contract environments:

1. **PolkaVM contracts**: Available on Polkadot Hub, using a RISC-V-based virtual machine with Solidity compatibility.
2. **EVM contracts**: Available on parachains like Moonbeam, Astar, and Acala via the Frontier framework.
3. **Wasm contracts**: Using ink! (Rust-based) or Solidity via Solang compiler.

### Should I build a smart contract or a parachain?

Choose smart contracts if:

- You want to deploy quickly without managing consensus.
- Your application fits within existing chain functionality.
- You prefer familiar development tools (Ethereum ecosystem).
- You need to interact with other contracts easily.

Choose a parachain if:

- You need custom logic that doesn't fit smart contract limitations.
- You want full control over governance and upgrades.
- You require specialized consensus mechanisms.
- You need optimized fee structures.

### What's the difference between Polkadot Hub smart contracts and other EVM chains?

Polkadot Hub contracts run on [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design){target=\_blank} instead of EVM:

- **Performance**: RISC-V register-based architecture vs. stack-based EVM.
- **Resource metering**: Three dimensions (`ref_time`, `proof_size`, `storage_deposit`) vs. single gas metric.
- **Memory management**: Hard memory limits per contract vs. gas-based soft limits.
- **Account system**: Polkadot's 32-byte accounts with automatic 20-byte address conversion.

## Development Environment

### Can I use my existing Ethereum development tools?

Yes, check out the [Wallets](/develop/smart-contracts/wallets){target=\_blank} page, the [Development Environments](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/){target=\_blank}, and the [Libraries](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/){target=\_blank} sections for more information.

### How do I set up local development?

Check the [Local Development Node](/develop/smart-contracts/local-development-node){target=\_blank} for further instructions.

### What networks are available for testing and deployment?

- **Local Development**: Kitchensink node with Ethereum RPC proxy.
- **TestNets**: Polkadot Hub TestNet.

## Technical Implementation

### How do Ethereum addresses work on Polkadot?

Polkadot uses a [dual-address system](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/evm-vs-polkavm#account-management-comparison){target=\_blank}:

- _20-byte Ethereum addresses_ are padded with `0xEE` bytes to create 32-byte Polkadot accounts.
- _32-byte Polkadot accounts_ can register mappings to 20-byte addresses.
- _Automatic conversion_ happens behind the scenes.
- _MetaMask compatibility_ is maintained through the mapping system.

### What are the key differences in the gas model?

PolkaVM uses three resource dimensions:

- **`ref_time`**: Computational time (similar to traditional gas).
- **`proof_size`**: State proof size for validator verification.
- **`storage_deposit`**: Refundable deposit for state storage.

Key implications:

- Gas values are dynamically scaled based on performance benchmarks.
- Cross-contract calls don't respect gas limits (use reentrancy protection).
- Storage costs are separate from execution costs.

### How does contract deployment work?

PolkaVM deployment differs from EVM:

- _Code must be pre-uploaded_ to the chain before instantiation.
- _Factory contracts_ need modification to work with pre-uploaded code hashes.
- _Two-step process_: Upload code, then instantiate contracts.
- _Runtime code generation_ is not supported.

### Which Solidity features are not supported?

Limited support for:

- **`EXTCODECOPY`**: Only works in constructor code.
- **Runtime code modification**: Use on-chain constructors instead.
- **Gas stipends**: `address.send()` and `address.transfer()` don't provide reentrancy protection.

Unsupported operations:

- `pc`, `extcodecopy`, `selfdestruct`
- `blobhash`, `blobbasefee` (blob-related operations)

### How do I handle the existential deposit requirement?

What it means:

- Accounts need a minimum balance, also known as an existential deposit (ED), to remain active.
- Accounts below this threshold are automatically deleted.

How it's handled:

- _Balance queries_ via Ethereum RPC automatically deduct the ED.
- _New account transfers_ automatically include ED with transaction fees.
- _Contract-to-contract transfers_ draw ED from transaction signer, not sending contract.

## Migration and Compatibility

### Can I migrate my existing Ethereum contracts?

Most contracts work without changes:

- Standard ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 tokens.
- DeFi protocols and DEXs.
- DAOs and governance contracts.

May need modifications:

- Factory contracts that create other contracts at runtime.
- Contracts using `EXTCODECOPY` for runtime code manipulation.
- Contracts relying on gas stipends for reentrancy protection.

## Troubleshooting

### Why are my gas calculations different?

PolkaVM uses dynamic gas scaling:

- Gas values reflect actual performance benchmarks.
- Don't hardcode gas values—use flexible calculations.
- Cross-contract calls ignore gas limits—implement proper access controls.

### I deployed a contract with MetaMask, and got a `code size` error - why?

The latest MetaMask update affects the extension’s ability to deploy large contracts. Check the [Wallets](/develop/smart-contracts/wallets){target=\_blank} page for more details.

### I found a bug, where can I log it?

Please log any bugs in the [`contracts-issues`](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues){target=\_blank} repository so developers are aware of them and can address them.

## Known Issues

### Runtime Behavior

- **`creationCode` returns hash instead of bytecode**: The Solidity keyword returns a `keccak256` hash rather than the actual creation bytecode.
    - [Issue #45](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/45){target=\_blank}
- **Non-deterministic gas usage**: Gas consumption varies slightly for identical transactions.
    - [Issue #49](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/49){target=\_blank}
- **Precompiles not recognized**: Precompile addresses return `Contract not found` error.
    - [Issue #111](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/111){target=\_blank}

### Development Tools

- **`hardhat-polkadot` plugin compilation issues**: Plugin interferes with standard `npx hardhat compile` command.
    - [Issue #44](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/44){target=\_blank}

### Contract Patterns

- **Minimal proxy (EIP-1167) deployment fails**: Standard proxy contracts cannot be deployed on PolkaVM.
    - [Issue #86](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/86){target=\_blank}

### Compilation

- **`SDIV` opcode crash**: Compiler crashes with `Unsupported SDIV` assertion failure.

# PolkaVM Design

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

The Asset Hub smart contracts solution includes multiple components to ensure Ethereum compatibility and high performance. Its architecture allows for integration with current Ethereum tools, while its innovative virtual machine design enhances performance characteristics.

## PolkaVM

[**PolkaVM**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm){target=\_blank} is a custom virtual machine optimized for performance with [RISC-V-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V){target=\_blank} architecture, supporting Solidity and additional high-performance languages. It serves as the core execution environment, integrated directly within the runtime. It features:

- An efficient interpreter for immediate code execution.
- A planned JIT compiler for optimized performance.
- Dual-mode execution capability, allowing selection of the most appropriate backend for specific workloads.
- Optimized performance for short-running contract calls through the interpreter.

The interpreter remains particularly beneficial for contracts with minimal code execution, as it eliminates JIT compilation overhead and enables immediate code execution through lazy interpretation.

## Architecture

The smart contract solution consists of the following key components that work together to enable Ethereum compatibility on Polkadot-based chains.

### Pallet Revive

[**`pallet_revive`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} is a runtime module that executes smart contracts by adding extrinsics, runtime APIs, and logic to convert Ethereum-style transactions into formats compatible with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. It processes Ethereum-style transactions through the following workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/dApp
    participant Proxy as Ethereum JSON RPC Proxy
    participant Chain as Blockchain Node
    participant Pallet as pallet_revive
    
    User->>Proxy: Submit Ethereum Transaction
    Proxy->>Chain: Repackage as Polkadot Compatible Transaction
    Chain->>Pallet: Process Transaction
    Pallet->>Pallet: Decode Ethereum Transaction
    Pallet->>Pallet: Execute Contract via PolkaVM
    Pallet->>Chain: Return Results
    Chain->>Proxy: Forward Results
    Proxy->>User: Return Ethereum-compatible Response
```

This proxy-based approach eliminates the need for node binary modifications, maintaining compatibility across different client implementations. Preserving the original Ethereum transaction payload simplifies adapting existing tools, which can continue processing familiar transaction formats.

### PolkaVM Design Fundamentals

PolkaVM introduces two fundamental architectural differences compared to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "EVM Architecture"
        EVMStack[Stack-Based]
        EVM256[256-bit Word Size]
    end
    
    subgraph "PolkaVM Architecture"
        PVMReg[Register-Based]
        PVM64[64-bit Word Size]
    end
```

- **Register-based design**: PolkaVM utilizes a RISC-V register-based approach. This design:

    - Employs a finite set of registers for argument passing instead of an infinite stack.
    - Facilitates efficient translation to underlying hardware architectures.
    - Optimizes register allocation through careful register count selection.
    - Enables simple 1:1 mapping to x86-64 instruction sets.
    - Reduces compilation complexity through strategic register limitation.
    - Improves overall execution performance through hardware-aligned design.

- **64-bit word size**: PolkaVM operates with a 64-bit word size. This design:

    - Enables direct hardware-supported arithmetic operations.
    - Maintains compatibility with Solidity's 256-bit operations through YUL translation.
    - Allows integration of performance-critical components written in lower-level languages.
    - Optimizes computation-intensive operations through native word size alignment.
    - Reduces overhead for operations not requiring extended precision.
    - Facilitates efficient integration with modern CPU architectures.

## Compilation Process

When compiling a Solidity smart contract, the code passes through the following stages:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Dev[Developer] --> |Solidity<br>Source<br>Code| Solc
    
    subgraph "Compilation Process"
        direction LR
        Solc[solc] --> |YUL<br>IR| Revive
        Revive[Revive Compiler] --> |LLVM<br>IR| LLVM
        LLVM[LLVM<br>Optimizer] --> |RISC-V ELF<br>Shared Object| PVMLinker
    end
    
    PVMLinker[PVM Linker] --> PVM[PVM Blob<br>with Metadata]
```

The compilation process integrates several specialized components:

1. **Solc**: The standard Ethereum Solidity compiler that translates Solidity source code to [YUL IR](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html){target=\_blank}.
2. **Revive Compiler**: Takes YUL IR and transforms it to [LLVM IR](https://llvm.org/){target=\_blank}.
3. **LLVM**: A compiler infrastructure that optimizes the code and generates RISC-V ELF objects.
4. **PVM linker**: Links the RISC-V ELF object into a final PolkaVM blob with metadata.

Page Title: Send XCM Messages

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/develop-interoperability-send-messages.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/interoperability/send-messages/
- Summary: Send cross-chain messages using XCM, Polkadot's Cross-Consensus Messaging format, designed to support secure communication between chains.

# Send XCM Messages

## Introduction

One of the core FRAME pallets that enables parachains to engage in cross-chain communication using the Cross-Consensus Message (XCM) format is [`pallet-xcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/index.html){target=\_blank}. It facilitates the sending, execution, and management of XCM messages, thereby allowing parachains to interact with other chains within the ecosystem. Additionally, `pallet-xcm`, also referred to as the XCM pallet, supports essential operations like asset transfers, version negotiation, and message routing.

This page provides a detailed overview of the XCM pallet's key features, its primary roles in XCM operations, and the main extrinsics it offers. Whether aiming to execute XCM messages locally or send them to external chains, this guide covers the foundational concepts and practical applications you need to know.

## XCM Frame Pallet Overview

The [`pallet-xcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/index.html){target=\_blank} provides a set of pre-defined, commonly used [XCVM programs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#12-the-xcvm){target=\_blank} in the form of a [set of extrinsics](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/dispatchables/index.html){target=\blank}. This pallet provides some [default implementations](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#implementations){target=\_blank} for traits required by [`XcmConfig`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm_benchmarks/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmConfig){target=\_blank}. The [XCM executor](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/struct.XcmExecutor.html){target=\_blank} is also included as an associated type within the pallet's configuration. 

For further details about the XCM configuration, see the [XCM Configuration](/develop/interoperability/xcm-config/){target=\_blank} page.

Where the [XCM format](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format){target=\_blank} defines a set of instructions used to construct XCVM programs, `pallet-xcm` defines a set of extrinsics that can be utilized to build XCVM programs, either to target the local or external chains. The `pallet-xcm` functionality is divided into three categories:

- **Primitive**: Dispatchable functions to execute XCM locally.
- **High-level**: Functions for asset transfers between chains.
- **Version negotiation-specific**: Functions for managing XCM version compatibility.

### Key Roles of the XCM Pallet

The XCM pallet plays a central role in managing cross-chain messages, with its primary responsibilities including:

- **Execute XCM messages**: Interacts with the XCM executor to validate and execute messages, adhering to predefined security and filter criteria.
- **Send messages across chains**: Allows authorized origins to send XCM messages, enabling controlled cross-chain communication.
- **Reserve-based transfers and teleports**: Supports asset movement between chains, governed by filters that restrict operations to authorized origins.
- **XCM version negotiation**: Ensures compatibility by selecting the appropriate XCM version for inter-chain communication.
- **Asset trapping and recovery**: Manages trapped assets, enabling safe reallocation or recovery when issues occur during cross-chain transfers.
- **Support for XCVM operations**: Oversees state and configuration requirements necessary for executing cross-consensus programs within the XCVM framework.

## Primary Extrinsics of the XCM Pallet

This page will highlight the two **Primary Primitive Calls** responsible for sending and executing XCVM programs as dispatchable functions within the pallet.

### Execute

The [`execute`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.execute){target=\_blank} call directly interacts with the XCM executor, allowing for the execution of XCM messages originating from a locally signed origin. The executor validates the message, ensuring it complies with any configured barriers or filters before executing.

Once validated, the message is executed locally, and an event is emitted to indicate the result—whether the message was fully executed or only partially completed. Execution is capped by a maximum weight ([`max_weight`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.execute.field.max_weight){target=\_blank}); if the required weight exceeds this limit, the message will not be executed.

```rust
pub fn execute<T: Config>(
    message: Box<VersionedXcm<<T as Config>::RuntimeCall>>,
    max_weight: Weight,
)
```

For further details about the `execute` extrinsic, see the [`pallet-xcm` documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank}.

!!!warning
    Partial execution of messages may occur depending on the constraints or barriers applied.



### Send

The [`send`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.send){target=\_blank} call enables XCM messages to be sent to a specified destination. This could be a parachain, smart contract, or any external system governed by consensus. Unlike the execute call, the message is not executed locally but is transported to the destination chain for processing.

The destination is defined using a [Location](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/xcm_docs/glossary/index.html#location){target=\_blank}, which describes the target chain or system. This ensures precise delivery through the configured XCM transport mechanism.

```rust
pub fn send<T: Config>(
    dest: Box<MultiLocation>,
    message: Box<VersionedXcm<<T as Config>::RuntimeCall>>,
)
```

For further information about the `send` extrinsic, see the [`pallet-xcm` documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank}.



## XCM Router

The [`XcmRouter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmRouter){target=\_blank} is a critical component the XCM pallet requires to facilitate sending XCM messages. It defines where messages can be sent and determines the appropriate XCM transport protocol for the operation.

For instance, the Kusama network employs the [`ChildParachainRouter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_common/xcm_sender/struct.ChildParachainRouter.html){target=\_blank}, which restricts routing to [Downward Message Passing (DMP)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#dmp-downward-message-passing){target=\_blank} from the relay chain to parachains, ensuring secure and controlled communication.

```rust
pub type PriceForChildParachainDelivery =
	ExponentialPrice<FeeAssetId, BaseDeliveryFee, TransactionByteFee, Dmp>;
```

For more details about XCM transport protocols, see the [XCM Channels](/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/){target=\_blank} page.

# An Overview of the Smart Contract Landscape on Polkadot

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Polkadot is designed to support an ecosystem of parachains, rather than hosting smart contracts directly. Developers aiming to build smart contract applications on Polkadot rely on parachains within the ecosystem that provide smart contract functionality.

This guide outlines the primary approaches to developing smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem:

- **PolkaVM-compatible contracts**: Support Solidity and any language that compiles down to RISC-V while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum based tools.
- **EVM-compatible contracts**: Support languages like [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} and [Vyper](https://vyperlang.org/){target=\_blank}, offering compatibility with popular Ethereum tools and wallets.
- **Wasm-based smart contracts**: Using [ink!](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank}, a Rust-based embedded domain-specific language (eDSL), enabling developers to leverage Rust’s safety and tooling.

You'll explore the key differences between these development paths, along with considerations for parachain developers integrating smart contract functionality.

!!!note "Parachain Developer?"
    If you are a parachain developer looking to add smart contract functionality to your chain, please refer to the [Add Smart Contract Functionality](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/add-smart-contract-functionality/){target=\_blank} page, which covers both Wasm and EVM-based contract implementations.

## Smart Contracts Versus Parachains

A smart contract is a program that executes specific logic isolated to the chain on which it is being executed. All the logic executed is bound to the same state transition rules determined by the underlying virtual machine (VM). Consequently, smart contracts are more streamlined to develop, and programs can easily interact with each other through similar interfaces.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph A[Chain State]
    direction LR
    B["Program Logic and Storage<br/>(Smart Contract)"]
    C["Tx Relevant Storage"]
  end
  A --> D[[Virtual Machine]]
  E[Transaction] --> D
  D --> F[(New State)]
  D --> G[Execution Logs]
  style A fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

In addition, because smart contracts are programs that execute on top of existing chains, teams don't have to think about the underlying consensus they are built on.

These strengths do come with certain limitations. Some smart contracts environments, like EVM, tend to be immutable by default. Developers have developed different [proxy strategies](https://www.openzeppelin.com/news/proxy-patterns){target=\_blank} to be able to upgrade smart contracts over time. The typical pattern relies on a proxy contract which holds the program storage forwarding a call to an implementation contract where the execution logic resides. Smart contract upgrades require changing the implementation contract while retaining the same storage structure, necessitating careful planning.

Another downside is that smart contracts often follow a gas metering model, where program execution is associated with a given unit and a marketplace is set up to pay for such an execution unit. This fee system is often very rigid, and some complex flows, like account abstraction, have been developed to circumvent this problem.

In contrast, parachains can create their own custom logics (known as pallets or modules), and combine them as the state transition function (STF or runtime) thanks to the modularity provided by the [Polkadot-SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}. The different pallets within the parachain runtime can give developers a lot of flexibility when building applications on top of it.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[(Chain State)] --> B[["STF<br/>[Pallet 1]<br/>[Pallet 2]<br/>...<br/>[Pallet N]"]]
    C[Transaction<br/>Targeting Pallet 2] --> B
    B --> E[(New State)]
    B --> F[Execution Logs]
```

Parachains inherently offer features such as logic upgradeability, flexible transaction fee mechanisms, and chain abstraction logic. More so, by using Polkadot, parachains can benefit from robust consensus guarantees with little engineering overhead.

To read more about the differences between smart contracts and parachain runtimes, see the [Runtime vs. Smart Contracts](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/runtime_vs_smart_contract/index.html){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot SDK Rust docs. For a more in-depth discussion about choosing between runtime development and smart contract development, see the Stack Overflow post on [building a Polkadot SDK runtime versus a smart contract](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56041305){target=\_blank}.

## Building a Smart Contract

The Polkadot SDK supports multiple smart contract execution environments:

- **PolkaVM**: A cutting-edge virtual machine tailored to optimize smart contract execution on Polkadot. Unlike traditional EVMs, PolkaVM is built with a [RISC-V-based register architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V){target=\_blank} for increased performance and scalability.
- **EVM**: Through [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank}. It consists of a full Ethereum JSON RPC compatible client, an Ethereum emulation layer, and a [Rust-based EVM](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm){target=\_blank}. This is used by chains like [Acala](https://acala.network/){target=\_blank}, [Astar](https://astar.network/){target=\_blank}, [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} and more.
- **Wasm**: [ink!](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank} is a domain-specific language (DSL) for Rust smart contract development that uses the [Contracts pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/contracts/){target=\_blank} with [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract){target=\_blank} serving as the compiler to WebAssembly. Wasm contracts can be used by chains like [Astar](https://astar.network/){target=\_blank}.

### PolkaVM Contracts

A component of the Asset Hub parachain, PolkaVM helps enable the deployment of Solidity-based smart contracts directly on Asset Hub. Learn more about how this cutting edge virtual machine facilitates using familiar Ethereum-compatible contracts and tools with Asset Hub by visiting the [Native Smart Contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/overview#native-smart-contracts){target=\_blank} guide.

### EVM Contracts

The [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} project provides a set of modules that enables a Polkadot SDK-based chain to run an Ethereum emulation layer that allows the execution of EVM smart contracts natively with the same API/RPC interface.

[Ethereum addresses (ECDSA)](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#address){target=\_blank} can also be mapped directly to and from the Polkadot SDK's SS58 scheme from existing accounts. Moreover, you can modify Polkadot SDK to use the ECDSA signature scheme directly to avoid any mapping.

At a high level, [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} is composed of three main components:

- **[Ethereum Client](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/client){target=\_blank}**: An Ethereum JSON RPC compliant client that allows any request coming from an Ethereum tool, such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank} or [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank}, to be admitted by the network.
- **[Pallet Ethereum](https://docs.rs/pallet-ethereum/latest/pallet_ethereum/){target=\_blank}**: A block emulation and Ethereum transaction validation layer that works jointly with the Ethereum client to ensure compatibility with Ethereum tools.
- **[Pallet EVM](https://docs.rs/pallet-evm/latest/pallet_evm/){target=\_blank}**: Access layer to the [Rust-based EVM](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm){target=\_blank}, enabling the execution of EVM smart contract logic natively.

The following diagram illustrates a high-level overview of the path an EVM transaction follows when using this configuration:

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Users and Devs] -->|Send Tx| B[Frontier RPC Ext]
    subgraph C[Pallet Ethereum]
        D[Validate Tx]
        E[Send<br/>Valid Tx]    
    end
    B -->|Interact with| C
    D --> E
    subgraph F[Pallet EVM]
        G[Rust EVM]
    end
    I[(Current EVM<br/>Emulated State)]

    H[Smart Contract<br/>Solidity, Vyper...] <-->|Compiled to EVM<br/>Bytecode| I

    C --> F
    I --> F
    F --> J[(New Ethereum<br/>Emulated State)]
    F --> K[Execution Logs]

    style C fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
    style F fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

Although it seems complex, users and developers are abstracted of that complexity, and tools can easily interact with the parachain as they would with any other Ethereum-compatible environment.

The Rust EVM is capable of executing regular [EVM bytecode](https://www.ethervm.io/){target=\_blank}. Consequently, any language that compiles to EVM bytecode can be used to create programs that the parachain can execute.

### Wasm Contracts

The [`pallet_contracts`](https://docs.rs/pallet-contracts/latest/pallet_contracts/index.html#contracts-pallet){target=\_blank} provides the execution environment for Wasm-based smart contracts. Consequently, any smart contract language that compiles to Wasm can be executed in a parachain that enables this module.

At the time of writing there are two main languages that can be used for Wasm programs:

- **[ink!](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank}**: A Rust-based language that compiles to Wasm. It allows developers to inherit all its safety guarantees and use normal Rust tooling, being the dedicated domain-specific language.
- **Solidity**: Can be compiled to Wasm via the [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang/){target=\_blank} compiler. Consequently, developers can write Solidity 0.8 smart contracts that can be executed as Wasm programs in parachains.

The following diagram illustrates a high-level overview of the path a transaction follows when using [`pallet_contracts`](https://docs.rs/pallet-contracts/latest/pallet_contracts/index.html#contracts-pallet){target=\_blank}:

``` mermaid

To successfully complete this tutorial, you must ensure you've first:

- [Installed Zombienet](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/#install-zombienet){target=\_blank}. This tutorial requires Zombienet version `v1.3.133`. Verify that you're using the specified version to ensure compatibility with the instructions.
- Reviewed the information in [Configure Zombienet](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/#configure-zombienet){target=\_blank} and understand how to customize a spawned network.

## Set Up Local Provider

In this tutorial, you will use the Zombienet [local provider](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/#local-provider){target=\_blank} (also called native provider) that enables you to run nodes as local processes in your development environment.

You must have the necessary binaries installed (such as `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain`) to spin up your network successfully.

To install the required binaries, use the following Zombienet CLI command:

```bash
zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
```

This command downloads the following binaries:

- `polkadot`
- `polkadot-execute-worker`
- `polkadot-parachain`
- `polkadot-prepare-worker`

Finally, add these binaries to your PATH environment variable to ensure Zombienet can locate them when spawning the network.

For example, you can move the binaries to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo mv ./polkadot ./polkadot-execute-worker ./polkadot-parachain ./polkadot-prepare-worker /usr/local/bin
```

## Define the Network

Zombienet uses a [configuration file](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/#configuration-files){target=\_blank} to define the ephemeral network that will be spawned. Follow these steps to create and define the configuration file:

1. Create a file named `spawn-a-basic-network.toml`:

    ```bash
    touch spawn-a-basic-network.toml
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file you just created:

    ```toml title="spawn-a-basic-network.toml"
    [settings]
    timeout = 120

    [relaychain]

    [[relaychain.nodes]]
    name = "alice"
    validator = true

    [[relaychain.nodes]]
    name = "bob"
    validator = true

    [[parachains]]
    id = 100

    [parachains.collator]
    name = "collator01"

    ```

This configuration file defines a network with the following chains:

- **relaychain**: With two nodes named `alice` and `bob`.
- **parachain**: With a collator named `collator01`.

Settings also defines a timeout of 120 seconds for the network to be ready.

## Spawn the Network

To spawn the network, run the following command:

```bash
zombienet -p native spawn spawn-a-basic-network.toml
```

This command will spawn the network defined in the `spawn-a-basic-network.toml` configuration file. The `-p native` flag specifies that the network will be spawned using the native provider.

If successful, you will see the following output:

<div id="termynal" class="table-termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>zombienet -p native spawn spawn-a-basic-network.toml</span>

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

!!! note 
    If the IPs and ports aren't explicitly defined in the configuration file, they may change each time the network is started, causing the links provided in the output to differ from the example.

## Interact with the Spawned Network

After the network is launched, you can interact with it using [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank}. To do so, open your browser and use the provided links listed by the output as `Direct Link`.

### Connect to the Nodes

Use the [55308 port address](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:55308#explorer){target=\_blank} to interact with the same `alice` node used for this tutorial. Ports can change from spawn to spawn so be sure to locate the link in the output when spawning your own node to ensure you are accessing the correct port.

If you want to interact with the nodes more programmatically, you can also use the [Polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/){target=\_blank}. For example, the following code snippet shows how to connect to the `alice` node using the Polkadot.js API and log some information about the chain and node:

```typescript
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

async function main() {
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('ws://127.0.0.1:55308');
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });

  // Retrieve the chain & node information via rpc calls
  const [chain, nodeName, nodeVersion] = await Promise.all([
    api.rpc.system.chain(),
    api.rpc.system.name(),
    api.rpc.system.version(),
  ]);

  console.log(
    `You are connected to chain ${chain} using ${nodeName} v${nodeVersion}`
  );
}

main()
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => process.exit());

```

Both methods allow you to interact easily with the network and its nodes.

### Check Metrics

You can also check the metrics of the nodes by accessing the links provided in the output as `Prometheus Link`. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank} is a monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from the nodes. By accessing the provided links, you can see the metrics of the nodes in a web interface. So, for example, the following image shows the Prometheus metrics for Bob's node from the Zombienet test:

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/spawn-basic-chain/spawn-basic-network-01.webp)

### Check Logs

To view individual node logs, locate the `Log Cmd` command in Zombienet's startup output. For example, to see what the alice node is doing, find the log command that references `alice.log` in its file path. Note that Zombienet will show you the correct path for your instance when it starts up, so use that path rather than copying from the below example:

```bash
tail -f  /tmp/zombie-794af21178672e1ff32c612c3c7408dc_-2397036-6717MXDxcS55/alice.log
```

After running this command, you will see the logs of the `alice` node in real-time, which can be useful for debugging purposes. The logs of the `bob` and `collator01` nodes can be checked similarly.

- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/interoperability/test-and-debug/
- Summary: Learn how to test and debug cross-chain communication via the XCM Emulator to ensure interoperability and reliable execution.

# Testing and Debugging

## Introduction

Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) is a core feature of the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling communication between parachains, relay chains, and system chains. To ensure the reliability of XCM-powered blockchains, thorough testing and debugging are essential before production deployment.

This guide covers the XCM Emulator, a tool designed to facilitate onboarding and testing for developers. Use the emulator if:

- A live runtime is not yet available.
- Extensive configuration adjustments are needed, as emulated chains differ from live networks.
- Rust-based tests are preferred for automation and integration.

For scenarios where real blockchain state is required, [Chopsticks](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/#xcm-testing){target=\_blank} allows testing with any client compatible with Polkadot SDK-based chains.

## XCM Emulator

Setting up a live network with multiple interconnected parachains for XCM testing can be complex and resource-intensive. 

The [`xcm-emulator`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/polkadot-stable2506-2/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator){target=\_blank} is a tool designed to simulate the execution of XCM programs using predefined runtime configurations. These configurations include those utilized by live networks like Kusama, Polkadot, and Asset Hub.

This tool enables testing of cross-chain message passing, providing a way to verify outcomes, weights, and side effects efficiently. It achieves this by utilizing mocked runtimes for both the relay chain and connected parachains, enabling developers to focus on message logic and configuration without needing a live network.

The `xcm-emulator` relies on transport layer pallets. However, the messages do not leverage the same messaging infrastructure as live networks since the transport mechanism is mocked. Additionally, consensus-related events are not covered, such as disputes and staking events. Parachains should use end-to-end (E2E) tests to validate these events.

### Advantages and Limitations

The XCM Emulator provides both advantages and limitations when testing cross-chain communication in simulated environments.

- **Advantages**:
    - **Interactive debugging**: Offers tracing capabilities similar to EVM, enabling detailed analysis of issues.
    - **Runtime composability**: Facilitates testing and integration of multiple runtime components.
    - **Immediate feedback**: Supports Test-Driven Development (TDD) by providing rapid test results.
    - **Seamless integration testing**: Simplifies the process of testing new runtime versions in an isolated environment.

- **Limitations**:
    - **Simplified emulation**: Always assumes message delivery, which may not mimic real-world network behavior.
    - **Dependency challenges**: Requires careful management of dependency versions and patching. Refer to the [Cargo dependency documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html){target=\_blank}.
    - **Compilation overhead**: Testing environments can be resource-intensive, requiring frequent compilation updates.

### How Does It Work?

The `xcm-emulator` provides macros for defining a mocked testing environment. Check all the existing macros and functionality in the [XCM Emulator source code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/polkadot-stable2506-2/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}.

    		source = BridgeHubRococoPara,
    		target = BridgeHubWestendPara,
    		handler = RococoWestendMessageHandler
    	},
    	pub struct WestendRococoMockBridge {
    		source = BridgeHubWestendPara,
    		target = BridgeHubRococoPara,
    		handler = WestendRococoMessageHandler
    	}
    }

- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/blocks-transactions-fees/
- Summary: Explore how Asset Hub smart contracts handle blocks, transactions, and fees with EVM compatibility, supporting various Ethereum transaction types.

# Blocks, Transactions, and Fees

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Asset Hub smart contracts operate within the Polkadot ecosystem using the [`pallet_revive`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/){target=\_blank} implementation, which provides EVM compatibility. While many aspects of blocks and transactions are inherited from the underlying parachain architecture, there are specific considerations and mechanisms unique to smart contract operations on Asset Hub.

## Smart Contract Blocks

Smart contract blocks in Asset Hub follow the same fundamental structure as parachain blocks, inheriting all standard parachain block components. The `pallet_revive` implementation maintains this consistency while adding necessary [EVM-specific features](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm){target=\_blank}. For detailed implementation specifics, the [`Block`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Block.html){target=\_blank} struct in `pallet_revive` demonstrates how parachain and smart contract block implementations align.

## Smart Contract Transactions

Asset Hub implements a sophisticated transaction system that supports various transaction types and formats, encompassing both traditional parachain operations and EVM-specific interactions.

### EVM Transaction Types

The system provides a fundamental [`eth_transact`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/pallet/dispatchables/fn.eth_transact.html){target=\_blank} interface for processing raw EVM transactions dispatched through [Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs](/develop/smart-contracts/json-rpc-apis/){target=\_blank}. This interface acts as a wrapper for Ethereum transactions, requiring an encoded signed transaction payload, though it cannot be dispatched directly. Building upon this foundation, the system supports multiple transaction formats to accommodate different use cases and optimization needs:

- **[Legacy transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.TransactionLegacyUnsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: The original Ethereum transaction format, providing basic transfer and contract interaction capabilities. These transactions use a simple pricing mechanism and are supported for backward compatibility.

- **[EIP-1559 transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Transaction1559Unsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: An improved transaction format that introduces a more predictable fee mechanism with base fee and priority fee components. This format helps optimize gas fee estimation and network congestion management.

- **[EIP-2930 transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Transaction2930Unsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: Introduces access lists to optimize gas costs for contract interactions by pre-declaring accessed addresses and storage slots.

- **[EIP-4844 transactions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/evm/struct.Transaction4844Unsigned.html){target=\_blank}**: Implements blob-carrying transactions, designed to optimize Layer 2 scaling solutions by providing dedicated space for roll-up data.

Each transaction type can exist in both signed and unsigned states, with appropriate validation and processing mechanisms for each.

## Fees and Gas

Asset Hub implements a sophisticated resource management system that combines parachain transaction fees with EVM gas mechanics, providing both Ethereum compatibility and enhanced features.

### Gas Model Overview

Gas serves as the fundamental unit for measuring computational costs, with each network operation consuming a specified amount. This implementation maintains compatibility with Ethereum's approach while adding parachain-specific optimizations.

- **Dynamic gas scaling**: Asset Hub implements a dynamic pricing mechanism that reflects actual execution performance. This results in:

    - More efficient pricing for computational instructions relative to I/O operations.
    - Better correlation between gas costs and actual resource consumption.
    - Need for developers to implement flexible gas calculation rather than hardcoding values.

- **Multi-dimensional resource metering**: Asset Hub extends beyond the traditional single-metric gas model to track three distinct resources.

    - `ref_time` (computation time):

        - Functions as traditional gas equivalent.
        - Measures actual computational resource usage.
        - Primary metric for basic operation costs.


    - `proof_size` (verification overhead):

        - Tracks state proof size required for validator verification.
        - Helps manage consensus-related resource consumption.
        - Important for cross-chain operations.


    - `storage_deposit` (state management):

        - Manages blockchain state growth.
        - Implements a deposit-based system for long-term storage.
        - Refundable when storage is freed.

These resources can be limited at both transaction and contract levels, similar to Ethereum's gas limits. For more information, check the [Gas Model](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/evm-vs-polkavm#gas-model){target=\_blank} section in the [EVM vs PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/evm-vs-polkavm/){target=\_blank} article.

### Fee Components

- Base fees:

    - Storage deposit for contract deployment.
    - Minimum transaction fee for network access.
    - Network maintenance costs.

- Execution fees:

    - Computed based on gas consumption.
    - Converted to native currency using network-defined rates.
    - Reflects actual computational resource usage.

- Storage fees:

    - Deposit for long-term storage usage.
    - Refundable when storage is freed.
    - Helps prevent state bloat.

### Gas Calculation and Conversion

The system maintains precise conversion mechanisms between:

- Substrate weights and EVM gas units.
- Native currency and gas costs.
- Different resource metrics within the multi-dimensional model.

This ensures accurate fee calculation while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and workflows.

    ```bash
    mkdir hardhat-example
    cd hardhat-example
    ```

2. Initialize a new npm project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3. To interact with Polkadot, Hardhat requires the following plugin to compile contracts to PolkaVM bytecode and to spawn a local node compatible with PolkaVM:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev @parity/hardhat-polkadot@0.1.9
    ```

4. Create a Hardhat project:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat-polkadot init
    ```

    Select **Create a JavaScript project** when prompted and follow the instructions. After that, your project will be created with three main folders:

    - **`contracts`**: Where your Solidity smart contracts live.
    - **`test`**: Contains your test files that validate contract functionality.
    - **`ignition`**: Deployment modules for safely deploying your contracts to various networks.

5. Add the following folder to the `.gitignore` file if it is not already there:

    ```bash
    echo '/ignition/deployments/' >> .gitignore
    ```

6. Finish the setup by installing all the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    !!! note
        This last step is needed to set up the `hardhat-polkadot` plugin. It will install the `@parity/hardhat-polkadot` package and all its dependencies. In the future, the plugin will handle this automatically.

## Compile Your Contract

The plugin will compile your Solidity contracts for Solidity versions `0.8.0` and higher to be PolkaVM compatible. When compiling your contract, there are two ways to configure your compilation process:

- **npm compiler**: Uses library [@parity/resolc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parity/resolc){target=\_blank} for simplicity and ease of use.
- **Binary compiler**: Uses your local `resolc` binary directly for more control and configuration options.

To compile your project, follow these instructions:

1. Modify your Hardhat configuration file to specify which compilation process you will be using and activate the `polkavm` flag in the Hardhat network:

    === "npm Configuration"

        ```javascript title="hardhat.config.js" hl_lines="9-11 14"
        // hardhat.config.js
        require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox');

        require('@parity/hardhat-polkadot');

        /** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
        module.exports = {
          solidity: '0.8.28',
          resolc: {
            compilerSource: 'npm',
          },
          networks: {
            hardhat: {
              polkavm: true,
            },
          },
        };
        ```

    === "Binary Configuration"

        ```javascript title="hardhat.config.js" hl_lines="9-14 17"
        // hardhat.config.js
        require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox');

        require('@parity/hardhat-polkadot');

        /** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
        module.exports = {
          solidity: '0.8.28',
          resolc: {
            compilerSource: 'binary',
            settings: {
              compilerPath: 'INSERT_PATH_TO_RESOLC_COMPILER',
            },
          },
          networks: {
            hardhat: {
              polkavm: true,
            },
          },
        };
        ```

    For the binary configuration, replace `INSERT_PATH_TO_RESOLC_COMPILER` with the proper path to the binary. To obtain the binary, check the [releases](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/releases){target=\_blank} section of the `resolc` compiler, and download the latest version.

    The default settings used can be found in the [`constants.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/hardhat-polkadot/blob/v0.1.5/packages/hardhat-polkadot-resolc/src/constants.ts#L8-L23){target=\_blank} file of the `hardhat-polkadot` source code. You can change them according to your project needs. Generally, the recommended settings for optimized outputs are the following:

    ```javascript title="hardhat.config.js" hl_lines="4-10"
    resolc: {
      ...
      settings: {
        optimizer: {
          enabled: true,
          parameters: 'z',
          fallbackOz: true,
          runs: 200,
        },
        standardJson: true,
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

    You can check the [`ResolcConfig`](https://github.com/paritytech/hardhat-polkadot/blob/v0.1.5/packages/hardhat-polkadot-resolc/src/types.ts#L26){target=\_blank} for more information about compilation settings.

2. Compile the contract with Hardhat:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

3. After successful compilation, you'll see the artifacts generated in the `artifacts-pvm` directory:

    ```bash
    ls artifacts-pvm/contracts/*.sol/
    ```

    You should see JSON files containing the contract ABI and bytecode of the contracts you compiled.

## Set Up a Testing Environment

Hardhat allows you to spin up a local testing environment to test and validate your smart contract functionalities before deploying to live networks. The `hardhat-polkadot` plugin provides the possibility to spin up a local node with an ETH-RPC adapter for running local tests.

For complete isolation and control over the testing environment, you can configure Hardhat to work with a fresh local Substrate node. This approach is ideal when you want to test in a clean environment without any existing state or when you need specific node configurations.

Configure a local node setup by adding the node binary path along with the ETH-RPC adapter path:

```javascript title="hardhat.config.js" hl_lines="12-20"
// hardhat.config.js
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox');

require('@parity/hardhat-polkadot');
/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
    ...
      networks: {
        hardhat: {
          polkavm: true,
          nodeConfig: {
            nodeBinaryPath: 'INSERT_PATH_TO_SUBSTRATE_NODE',
            rpcPort: 8000,
            dev: true,
          },
          adapterConfig: {
            adapterBinaryPath: 'INSERT_PATH_TO_ETH_RPC_ADAPTER',
            dev: true,
          },
        },
  },
};
```

Replace `INSERT_PATH_TO_SUBSTRATE_NODE` and `INSERT_PATH_TO_ETH_RPC_ADAPTER` with the actual paths to your compiled binaries. The `dev: true` flag configures both the node and adapter for development mode. To obtain these binaries, check the [Installation](/develop/smart-contracts/local-development-node#install-the-substrate-node-and-eth-rpc-adapter){target=\_blank} section on the Local Development Node page.

!!! warning
    If you're using the default `hardhat.config.js` created by the `hardhat-polkadot` plugin, it includes a `forking` section pointing to the Polkadot Hub TestNet. When you run `npx hardhat node`, Hardhat will start a fork of that network. To use your local node instead, comment out the `forking` section; otherwise, `npx hardhat node` will continue to use the forked network even if a local node is defined in the configuration.

Once configured, start your chosen testing environment with:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This command will launch either the forked network or local node (depending on your configuration) along with the ETH-RPC adapter, providing you with a complete testing environment ready for contract deployment and interaction. By default, the Substrate node will be running on `localhost:8000` and the ETH-RPC adapter on `localhost:8545`.

The output will be something like this:

## Test Your Contract

When testing your contract, be aware that [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox/network-helpers`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/overview){target=\_blank} is not fully compatible with Polkadot Hub's available RPCs. Specifically, Hardhat-only helpers like `time` and `loadFixture` may not work due to missing RPC calls in the node. For more details, refer to the [Compatibility](https://github.com/paritytech/hardhat-polkadot/tree/main/packages/hardhat-polkadot-node#compatibility){target=\_blank} section in the `hardhat-revive` docs. You should avoid using helpers like `time` and `loadFixture` when writing tests.

To run your test:

1. Update the `hardhat.config.js` file accordingly to the [Set Up a Testing Environment](#set-up-a-testing-environment) section.

2. Execute the following command to run your tests:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```

## Deploy to a Local Node

Before deploying to a live network, you can deploy your contract to a local node using [Ignition](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started#overview){target=\_blank} modules:

1. Update the Hardhat configuration file to add the local network as a target for local deployment:

    ```javascript title="hardhat.config.js" hl_lines="13-16"
    // hardhat.config.js
    require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox');

    require('@parity/hardhat-polkadot');
    /** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
    module.exports = {
        ...
          networks: {
            hardhat: {
            ...
              },
              localNode: {
                polkavm: true,
                url: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`,
              },
        },
      },
    };
    ```

2. Start a local node:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat node
    ```

    This command will spawn a local Substrate node along with the ETH-RPC adapter.

3. In a new terminal window, deploy the contract using Ignition:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyToken.js --network localNode
    ```

## Deploying to a Live Network

After testing your contract locally, you can deploy it to a live network. This guide will use the Polkadot Hub TestNet as the target network. Here's how to configure and deploy:

1. Fund your deployment account with enough tokens to cover gas fees. In this case, the needed tokens are PAS (on Polkadot Hub TestNet). You can use the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111){target=\_blank} to obtain testing tokens.

2. Export your private key and save it in your Hardhat environment:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat vars set PRIVATE_KEY "INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY"
    ```

    Replace `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` with your actual private key. For further details on private key exportation, refer to the article [How to export an account's private key](https://support.metamask.io/configure/accounts/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/){target=\_blank}.

    !!! warning
        Never reveal your private key, otherwise anyone with access to it can control your wallet and steal your funds. Store it securely and never share it publicly or commit it to version control systems.

3. Check that your private key has been set up successfully by running:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat vars get PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

4. Update your Hardhat configuration file with network settings for the Polkadot network you want to target:

    ```javascript title="hardhat.config.js" hl_lines="18-22"
    // hardhat.config.js
    require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox');

    require('@parity/hardhat-polkadot');
    const { vars } = require('hardhat/config');

    /** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
    module.exports = {
        ...
          networks: {
            hardhat: {
            ...
              },
              localNode: {
            ...
              },
              polkadotHubTestnet: {
                polkavm: true,
                url: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
                accounts: [vars.get('PRIVATE_KEY')],
              },
        },
      },
    };
    ```

6. Deploy your contract using Ignition:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyToken.js --network polkadotHubTestnet
    ```

## Interacting with Your Contract

Once deployed, you can create a script to interact with your contract. To do so, create a file called `scripts/interact.js` and add some logic to interact with the contract.

For example, for the default `MyToken.sol` contract, you can use the following file that connects to the contract at its address and retrieves the `unlockTime`, which represents when funds can be withdrawn. The script converts this timestamp into a readable date and logs it. It then checks the contract's balance and displays it. Finally, it attempts to call the withdrawal function on the contract, but it catches and logs the error message if the withdrawal is not yet allowed (e.g., before `unlockTime`).

```javascript title="interact.js"
const hre = require('hardhat');

async function main() {
  // Get the contract factory
  const MyToken = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MyToken');

  // Replace with your deployed contract address
  const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

  // Attach to existing contract
  const token = await MyToken.attach(contractAddress);

  // Get signers
  const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  // Read contract state
  const name = await token.name();
  const symbol = await token.symbol();
  const totalSupply = await token.totalSupply();
  const balance = await token.balanceOf(deployer.address);

  console.log(`Token: ${name} (${symbol})`);
  console.log(
    `Total Supply: ${hre.ethers.formatUnits(totalSupply, 18)} tokens`,
  );
  console.log(
    `Deployer Balance: ${hre.ethers.formatUnits(balance, 18)} tokens`,
  );
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});

```

Run your interaction script:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network polkadotHubTestnet
```

## Upgrading the Plugin

If you already have a Hardhat Polkadot project and want to upgrade to a newer version of the plugin, to avoid errors (for example, `Cannot find module 'run-container'`), you can clean your dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

After that, you can upgrade the plugin to the latest version by running the following commands:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @parity/hardhat-polkadot@latest
npm install
```

Consider using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/){target=\_blank} 22.18+ and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank} version 10.9.0+ to avoid issues with the plugin.

## Where to Go Next

Hardhat provides a powerful environment for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Polkadot Hub. Its plugin architecture allows seamless integration with PolkaVM through the `hardhat-resolc` and `hardhat-revive-node` plugins.

!!! warning
    The Polkadot Remix IDE's contract compilation functionality is currently limited to Google Chrome. Alternative browsers are not recommended for this task.

## Overview

Remix IDE is a robust browser-based development environment for smart contracts. This guide will walk you through the essentials of the [Polkadot Remix IDE](https://remix.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank} to understand the processes of compiling, developing, and deploying smart contracts on Asset Hub.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- A web browser with [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/){target=\_blank} extension installed.
- Basic understanding of Solidity programming.
- Some WND test tokens to cover transaction fees (easily obtainable from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/westend?parachain=1000){target=\_blank}).

## Accessing Remix IDE

Navigate to [https://remix.polkadot.io/](https://remix.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. The interface will load with a default workspace containing sample contracts.

![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-1.webp)

In this interface, you can access a file explorer, edit your code, interact with various plugins for development, and use a terminal.

## Creating a New Contract

To create a new contract using the Polkadot Remix IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Select the **Create a new file** button in the `contracts` folder.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-2.webp)

2. Name your file with a `.sol` extension, in this case, `Counter.sol`.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-3.webp)

3. Write your Solidity code in the editor.

    You can use the following code as an example:

    ???- "Counter.sol"
        
        ```solidity
        // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
        pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

        contract Counter {
            int256 private count;

            function increment() public {
                count += 1;
            }

            function decrement() public {
                count -= 1;
            }

            function getCount() public view returns (int256) {
                return count;
            }
        }
        ```

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-4.webp)


## Compiling Your Contract

1. To compile your contract, you need to:

    1. Navigate to the **Solidity Compiler** tab (third icon in the left sidebar).
    2. Select **Compile** or use `Ctrl+S`.

        ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-5.webp)
    
        !!! note
            Compilation errors and warnings appear in the terminal panel at the bottom of the screen.

1. After compiling your contract, you can navigate to the **File Explorer** tab (first icon in the left sidebar) and check that:
    1. The `artifact` folder is present.
    2. The `Counter_metadata.json` and the `Counter.json` files have been generated.

        ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-6.webp)

## Deploying Contracts

1. To deploy your contract, you need to:

    1. Navigate to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab (fourth icon in the left sidebar).
    2. Click the **Environment** dropdown.
    3. Select **Customize this list**.

        ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-7.webp)

2. Enable the **Injected Provider - Talisman** option.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-8.webp)

4. Click again the **Environment** dropdown and select **Injected Provider - Talisman**.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-9.webp)

4. Click the **Deploy** button and then click **Approve** in the Talisman wallet popup.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-10.webp)

5. Once your contract is deployed successfully, you will see the following output in the Remix terminal:

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-11.webp)

## Interacting with Contracts

Once deployed, your contract appears in the **Deployed/Unpinned Contracts** section:

1. Expand the contract to view available methods.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-12.webp)

    !!! tip
        Pin your frequently used contracts to the **Pinned Contracts** section for easy access.

2. To interact with the contract, you can select any of the exposed methods.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/dev-environments/remix/remix-13.webp)

    In this way, you can interact with your deployed contract by reading its state or writing to it. The button color indicates the type of interaction available:

    - **Red**: Modifies state and is payable.
    - **Orange**: Modifies state only.
    - **Blue**: Reads state.

## Where to Go Next

The Polkadot Remix IDE offers an environment for developing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts on Asset Hub. Its intuitive interface allows developers to easily write Solidity code, compile contracts, and interact with them directly in the browser.

# viem

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

[viem](https://viem.sh/){target=\_blank} is a lightweight TypeScript library designed for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains. This comprehensive guide will walk you through using viem to interact with and deploy smart contracts to Polkadot Hub.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.13.1 or later, check the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/){target=\_blank}.
- **npm**: v6.13.4 or later (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **Solidity**: This guide uses Solidity `^0.8.9` for smart contract development.

## Project Structure

This project organizes contracts, scripts, and compiled artifacts for easy development and deployment.

```text
viem-project/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── src/
│   ├── chainConfig.ts
│   ├── createClient.ts
│   ├── createWallet.ts
│   ├── compile.ts
│   ├── deploy.ts
│   └── interact.ts
├── contracts/
│   └── Storage.sol
└── artifacts/
    ├── Storage.json
    └── Storage.polkavm
```

## Set Up the Project

First, create a new folder and initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir viem-project
cd viem-project
npm init -y
```

## Install Dependencies

Install viem along with other necessary dependencies, including [@parity/resolc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parity/resolc){target=\_blank}, which enables to compile smart contracts to [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design/#polkavm){target=\_blank} bytecode:

```bash
# Install viem and resolc
npm install viem @parity/resolc

# Install TypeScript and development dependencies
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/node
```

## Initialize Project

Initialize a TypeScript project by running the following command:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file to enable running TypeScript files:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "client": "ts-node src/createClient.ts",
        "compile": "ts-node src/compile.ts",
        "deploy": "ts-node src/deploy.ts",
        "interact": "ts-node src/interact.ts"
    },
}
```

Create a directory for your TypeScript source files:

```bash
mkdir src
```

## Set Up the Chain Configuration

The first step is to set up the chain configuration. Create a new file at `src/chainConfig.ts`:

```typescript title="src/chainConfig.ts"
import { http } from 'viem';

export const TRANSPORT = http('INSERT_RPC_URL');

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
export const POLKADOT_HUB = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME`, `INSERT_NETWORK_NAME`, `INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS`, `INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME`, and `INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` with the proper values. Check the [Connect to Polkadot](/develop/smart-contracts/connect-to-polkadot){target=\_blank} page for more information on the possible values.

## Set Up the viem Client

To interact with the chain, you need to create a client that is used solely for reading data. To accomplish this, create a new file at `src/createClient.ts`:

```typescript title="src/createClient.ts"
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http } from 'viem';

const transport = http('INSERT_RPC_URL');

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
const assetHub = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;

// Create a public client for reading data
export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: assetHub,
  transport,
});

```

After setting up the [Public Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public#public-client){target=\_blank}, you can begin querying the blockchain. Here's an example of fetching the latest block number:

??? code "Fetch Last Block code"

    ```js title="src/fetchLastBlock.ts"
    import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';

    const transport = http('https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io');

    // Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
    const polkadotHubTestnet = {
      id: 420420422,
      name: 'Polkadot Hub TestNet',
      network: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
      nativeCurrency: {
        decimals: 18,
        name: 'PAS',
        symbol: 'PAS',
      },
      rpcUrls: {
        default: {
          http: ['https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'],
        },
      },
    } as const;

    // Create a public client for reading data
    export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
      chain: polkadotHubTestnet,
      transport,
    });

    const main = async () => {
      try {
        const block = await publicClient.getBlock();
        console.log('Last block: ' + block.number.toString());
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        console.error('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + error);
      }
    };

    main();
    ```

## Set Up a Wallet

In case you need to sign transactions, you will need to instantiate a [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet#wallet-client){target=\_blank} object within your project. To do so, create `src/createWallet.ts`:

```typescript title="src/createWallet.ts"
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem';

const transport = http('INSERT_RPC_URL');

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
const assetHub = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;

// Create a wallet client for writing data
export const createWallet = (privateKey: `0x${string}`) => {
  const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
  return createWalletClient({
    account,
    chain: assetHub,
    transport,
  });
};
```

!!!note
    The wallet you import with your private key must have sufficient funds to pay for transaction fees when deploying contracts or interacting with them. Make sure to fund your wallet with the appropriate native tokens for the network you're connecting to.

## Sample Smart Contract

This example demonstrates compiling a `Storage.sol` Solidity contract for deployment to Polkadot Hub. The contract's functionality stores a number and permits users to update it with a new value.

```bash
mkdir contracts artifacts
```

You can use the following contract to interact with the blockchain. Paste the following contract in `contracts/Storage.sol`:

```solidity title="contracts/Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
// It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

## Compile the Contract

!!! note "Contracts Code Blob Size Disclaimer"
    The maximum contract code blob size on Polkadot Hub networks is _100 kilobytes_, significantly larger than Ethereum’s EVM limit of 24 kilobytes.

    For detailed comparisons and migration guidelines, see the [EVM vs. PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/evm-vs-polkavm/#current-memory-limits){target=\_blank} documentation page.

Create a new file at `src/compile.ts` for handling contract compilation:

```typescript title="src/compile.ts"
import { compile } from '@parity/resolc';
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs';
import { basename, join } from 'path';

const compileContract = async (
  solidityFilePath: string,
  outputDir: string
): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    // Read the Solidity file
    const source: string = readFileSync(solidityFilePath, 'utf8');

    // Construct the input object for the compiler
    const input: Record<string, { content: string }> = {
      [basename(solidityFilePath)]: { content: source },
    };

    console.log(`Compiling contract: ${basename(solidityFilePath)}...`);

    // Compile the contract
    const out = await compile(input);

    for (const contracts of Object.values(out.contracts)) {
      for (const [name, contract] of Object.entries(contracts)) {
        console.log(`Compiled contract: ${name}`);

        // Write the ABI
        const abiPath = join(outputDir, `${name}.json`);
        writeFileSync(abiPath, JSON.stringify(contract.abi, null, 2));
        console.log(`ABI saved to ${abiPath}`);

        // Write the bytecode
        if (
          contract.evm &&
          contract.evm.bytecode &&
          contract.evm.bytecode.object
        ) {
          const bytecodePath = join(outputDir, `${name}.polkavm`);
          writeFileSync(
            bytecodePath,
            Buffer.from(contract.evm.bytecode.object, 'hex')
          );
          console.log(`Bytecode saved to ${bytecodePath}`);
        } else {
          console.warn(`No bytecode found for contract: ${name}`);
        }
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error compiling contracts:', error);
  }
};

const solidityFilePath: string = './contracts/Storage.sol';
const outputDir: string = './artifacts/';

compileContract(solidityFilePath, outputDir);
```

To compile your contract:

```bash
npm run compile
```

After executing this script, you will see the compilation results including the generated `Storage.json` (containing the contract's ABI) and `Storage.polkavm` (containing the compiled bytecode) files in the `artifacts` folder. These files contain all the necessary information for deploying and interacting with your smart contract on Polkadot Hub.

## Deploy the Contract

Create a new file at `src/deploy.ts` for handling contract deployment:

```typescript title="src/deploy.ts"
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import { createWallet } from './createWallet';
import { publicClient } from './createClient';

const deployContract = async (
  contractName: string,
  privateKey: `0x${string}`
) => {
  try {
    console.log(`Deploying ${contractName}...`);

    // Read contract artifacts
    const abi = JSON.parse(
      readFileSync(
        join(__dirname, '../artifacts', `${contractName}.json`),
        'utf8'
      )
    );
    const bytecode = `0x${readFileSync(
      join(__dirname, '../artifacts', `${contractName}.polkavm`)
    ).toString('hex')}` as `0x${string}`;

    // Create wallet
    const wallet = createWallet(privateKey);

    // Deploy contract
    const hash = await wallet.deployContract({
      abi,
      bytecode,
      args: [], // Add constructor arguments if needed
    });

    // Wait for deployment
    const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
    const contractAddress = receipt.contractAddress;

    console.log(`Contract deployed at: ${contractAddress}`);
    return contractAddress;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Deployment failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

const privateKey = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';
deployContract('Storage', privateKey);
```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` with the proper value. For further details on private key exportation, refer to the article [How to export an account's private key](https://support.metamask.io/configure/accounts/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/){target=\_blank}.

!!! warning
    Never commit or share your private key. Exposed keys can lead to immediate theft of all associated funds. Use environment variables instead.

To deploy, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If everything is successful, you will see the address of your deployed contract displayed in the terminal. This address is unique to your contract on the network you defined in the chain configuration, and you'll need it for any future interactions with your contract.

## Interact with the Contract

Create a new file at `src/interact.ts` for interacting with your deployed contract:

```typescript title="src/interact.ts"
import { publicClient } from './createClient';
import { createWallet } from './createWallet';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';

const STORAGE_ABI = JSON.parse(
  readFileSync('./artifacts/Storage.json', 'utf8')
);

const interactWithStorage = async (
  contractAddress: `0x${string}`,
  privateKey: `0x${string}`
) => {
  try {
    const wallet = createWallet(privateKey);
    const currentNumber = await publicClient.readContract({
      address: contractAddress,
      abi: STORAGE_ABI,
      functionName: 'storedNumber',
      args: [],
    });
    console.log(`Stored number: ${currentNumber}`);

    const newNumber = BigInt(42);
    const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract({
      address: contractAddress,
      abi: STORAGE_ABI,
      functionName: 'setNumber',
      args: [newNumber],
      account: wallet.account,
    });

    const hash = await wallet.writeContract(request);
    await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
    console.log(`Number updated to ${newNumber}`);

    const updatedNumber = await publicClient.readContract({
      address: contractAddress,
      abi: STORAGE_ABI,
      functionName: 'storedNumber',
      args: [],
    });
    console.log('Updated stored number:', updatedNumber);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Interaction failed:', error);
  }
};

const PRIVATE_KEY = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

interactWithStorage(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, PRIVATE_KEY);

```

Ensure to replace `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the proper values.

To interact with the contract:

```bash
npm run interact
```

Following a successful interaction, you will see the stored value before and after the transaction. The output will show the initial stored number (0 if you haven't modified it yet), confirm when the transaction to set the number to 42 is complete, and then display the updated stored number value. This demonstrates both reading from and writing to your smart contract.

# Wagmi

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

[Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/){target=\_blank} is a collection of [React Hooks](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks){target=\_blank} for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains, focusing on developer experience, feature richness, and reliability.

This guide demonstrates how to use Wagmi to interact with and deploy smart contracts to Polkadot Hub, providing a seamless frontend integration for your dApps.

## Set Up the Project

To start working with Wagmi, create a new React project and initialize it by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Create a new React project using Next.js
npx create-next-app@latest wagmi-asset-hub
cd wagmi-asset-hub
```

## Install Dependencies

Install Wagmi and its peer dependencies:

```bash
# Install Wagmi and its dependencies
npm install wagmi viem @tanstack/react-query
```

## Configure Wagmi for Polkadot Hub

Create a configuration file to initialize Wagmi with Polkadot Hub. In your project, create a file named `src/lib/wagmi.ts` and add the code below. Be sure to replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME`, `INSERT_NETWORK_NAME`, `INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS`, `INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME`, and `INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` with your specific values.

```typescript title="src/lib/wagmi.ts"
import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi'

// Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
const assetHub = {
  id: INSERT_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
  network: 'INSERT_NETWORK_NAME',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: INSERT_CHAIN_DECIMALS,
    name: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_NAME',
    symbol: 'INSERT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
} as const;

// Create Wagmi config
export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [assetHub],
  transports: {
    [assetHub.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

??? code "Example Polkadot Hub TestNet Configuration"

    ```typescript title="src/lib/wagmi.ts"
    import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi';

    // Configure the Polkadot Hub chain
    const assetHub = {
      id: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
      network: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
      nativeCurrency: {
        decimals: 18,
        name: 'PAS',
        symbol: 'PAS',
      },
      rpcUrls: {
        default: {
          http: ['https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'],
        },
      },
    } as const;

    // Create wagmi config
    export const config = createConfig({
      chains: [assetHub],
      transports: {
        [assetHub.id]: http(),
      },
    });
    ```

## Set Up the Wagmi Provider

To enable Wagmi in your React application, you need to wrap your app with the [`WagmiProvider`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider#wagmiprovider){target=\_blank}. Update your `app/layout.tsx` file (for Next.js app router) with the following code:

```typescript title="app/layout.tsx"
// For app router (src/app/layout.tsx)
"use client";

import { WagmiProvider } from "wagmi";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { config } from "./lib/wagmi";

// Create a query client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <WagmiProvider config={config}>
          <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
            {children}
          </QueryClientProvider>
        </WagmiProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```

!!!note
    If you are using a Next.js pages router, you should modify the `src/pages/_app.tsx` instead.

## Connect a Wallet

Create a component to connect wallets to your dApp. Create a file named `app/components/ConnectWallet.tsx`:

```typescript title="app/components/ConnectWallet.tsx"
"use client";

import React from "react";
import { useConnect, useAccount, useDisconnect } from "wagmi";
import { injected } from "wagmi/connectors";

export function ConnectWallet() {
  const { connect } = useConnect();
  const { address, isConnected } = useAccount();
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect();

  if (isConnected) {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Connected to {address}</div>
        <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector: injected() })}>
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  );
}

```

This component uses the following React hooks:

- **[`useConnect`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useConnect#useconnect){target=\_blank}**: Provides functions and state for connecting the user's wallet to your dApp. The `connect` function initiates the connection flow with the specified connector.
- **[`useDisconnect`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useDisconnect#usedisconnect){target=\_blank}**: Provides a function to disconnect the currently connected wallet.
- **[`useAccount`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount#useaccount){target=\_blank}**: Returns data about the connected account, including the address and connection status.

## Fetch Blockchain Data

Wagmi provides various hooks to fetch blockchain data. Here's an example component that demonstrates some of these hooks:

```typescript title="app/components/BlockchainInfo.tsx"
"use client";

import { useBlockNumber, useBalance, useAccount } from "wagmi";

export function BlockchainInfo() {
  const { address } = useAccount();
  // Get the latest block number
  const { data: blockNumber } = useBlockNumber({ watch: true });

  // Get balance for the connected wallet
  const { data: balance } = useBalance({
    address,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Blockchain Information</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Current Block: {blockNumber?.toString() || "Loading..."}</p>

        {address && balance && (
          <p>
            Balance:{" "}
            {(
              BigInt(balance.value) / BigInt(10 ** balance.decimals)
            ).toLocaleString()}{" "}
            {balance.symbol}
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

```

This component uses the following React hooks:

- **[`useBlockNumber`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useBlockNumber#useBlockNumber){target=\_blank}**: Fetches the current block number of the connected chain. The `watch` parameter enables real-time updates when new blocks are mined.
- **[`useBalance`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useBalance#useBalance){target=\_blank}**: Retrieves the native token balance for a specified address, including value, symbol, and decimals information.

## Interact with Deployed Contract

This guide uses a simple Storage contract already deployed to the Polkadot Hub TestNet (`0x58053f0e8ede1a47a1af53e43368cd04ddcaf66f`). The code of that contract is:

??? code "Storage.sol"

    ```solidity title="Storage.sol"
    //SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

    // Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
    // It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
    pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

    contract Storage {
        // Public state variable to store a number
        uint256 public storedNumber;

        /**
        * Updates the stored number.
        *
        * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
        *
        * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
        */
        function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
            storedNumber = _newNumber;
        }
    }
    ```

Create a component to interact with your deployed contract. Create a file named `app/components/StorageContract.tsx`:

```typescript title="app/components/StorageContract.tsx"
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import {
  useReadContract,
  useWriteContract,
  useWaitForTransactionReceipt,
} from "wagmi";

const CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "0xabBd46Ef74b88E8B1CDa49BeFb5057710443Fd29" as `0x${string}`;

export function StorageContract() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState<string>("42");

  // Contract ABI (should match your compiled contract)
  const abi = [
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: "storedNumber",
      outputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "", type: "uint256" }],
      stateMutability: "view",
      type: "function",
    },
    {
      inputs: [
        { internalType: "uint256", name: "_newNumber", type: "uint256" },
      ],
      name: "setNumber",
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    },
  ];

  // Read the current stored number
  const { data: storedNumber, refetch } = useReadContract({
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi,
    functionName: "storedNumber",
  });

  // Write to the contract
  const { writeContract, data: hash, error, isPending } = useWriteContract();

  // Wait for transaction to be mined
  const { isLoading: isConfirming, isSuccess: isConfirmed } =
    useWaitForTransactionReceipt({
      hash,
    });

  const handleSetNumber = () => {
    writeContract({
      address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      abi,
      functionName: "setNumber",
      args: [BigInt(number)],
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Storage Contract Interaction</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Contract Address: {CONTRACT_ADDRESS}</p>
        <p>Current Stored Number: {storedNumber?.toString() || "Loading..."}</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <input
          type="number"
          value={number}
          onChange={(e) => setNumber(e.target.value)}
          disabled={isPending || isConfirming}
        />
        <button onClick={handleSetNumber} disabled={isPending || isConfirming}>
          {isPending
            ? "Waiting for approval..."
            : isConfirming
            ? "Confirming..."
            : "Set Number"}
        </button>
      </div>

      {error && <div className="error-message">Error: {error.message}</div>}

      {isConfirmed && (
        <div className="success-message">
          Successfully updated!{" "}
          <button onClick={() => refetch()}>Refresh</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

```

This component demonstrates how to interact with a smart contract using Wagmi's hooks:

- **[`useReadContract`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useReadContract#useReadContract){target=\_blank}**: Calls a read-only function on your smart contract to retrieve data without modifying the blockchain state.
- **[`useWriteContract`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract#useWriteContract){target=\_blank}**: Calls a state-modifying function on your smart contract, which requires a transaction to be signed and sent.
- **[`useWaitForTransactionReceipt`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWaitForTransactionReceipt#useWaitForTransactionReceipt){target=\_blank}**: Tracks the status of a transaction after it's been submitted, allowing you to know when it's been confirmed.

The component also includes proper state handling to:

- Show the current value stored in the contract.
- Allow users to input a new value.
- Display transaction status (pending, confirming, or completed).
- Handle errors.
- Provide feedback when a transaction is successful.

## Integrate Components

Update your main page to combine all the components. Create or update the file `src/app/page.tsx`:

```typescript title="src/app/page.tsx"
"use client";

import { BlockchainInfo } from "./components/BlockchainInfo";
import { ConnectWallet } from "./components/ConnectWallet";
import { StorageContract } from "./components/StorageContract";
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";

export default function Home() {
  const { isConnected } = useAccount();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Wagmi - Polkadot Hub Smart Contracts</h1>
      <ConnectWallet />
      {isConnected ? <BlockchainInfo /> : <span>Connect your wallet</span>}
      {isConnected ? <StorageContract /> : <span>Connect your wallet</span>}
    </main>
  );
}

```

# Wallets for Polkadot Hub

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Connecting a compatible wallet is the first essential step for interacting with the Polkadot Hub ecosystem. This guide explores wallet options that support both Substrate and Ethereum compatible layers, enabling transactions and smart contract interactions. Whether you're a developer testing on Polkadot Hub or a user accessing the MainNet, understanding wallet configuration is crucial for accessing the full range of Polkadot Hub's capabilities.

## Connect Your Wallet

### MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank} is a popular wallet for interacting with Ethereum-compatible chains. It allows users to connect to test networks that support Ethereum-based smart contracts. However, it's important to emphasize that MetaMask primarily facilitates interactions with smart contracts, giving users access to various chain functionalities. 

To get started with MetaMask, you need to install the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/download/){target=\_blank} and add it to the browser. Once you install MetaMask, you can set up a new wallet and securely store your seed phrase. This phrase is crucial for recovery in case you lose access.

For example, to connect to the Polkadot Hub TestNet via MetaMask, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open the MetaMask extension and click on the network icon to switch to the Polkadot Hub TestNet.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/wallets/wallets-1.webp){: .browser-extension}

2. Click on the **Add a custom network** button.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/wallets/wallets-2.webp){: .browser-extension}

3. Complete the necessary fields, then click the **Save** button (refer to the [Networks](/develop/smart-contracts/connect-to-polkadot#networks-details){target=\_blank} section for copy and paste parameters).

4. Click on **Polkadot Hub TestNet** to switch the network.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/wallets/wallets-4.webp){: .browser-extension}

The steps in the preceding section can be used to connect to any chain by modifying the network specification and endpoint parameters.

### SubWallet

[SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/){target=\_blank} is a popular non-custodial wallet solution for Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems. It offers seamless integration with Polkadot SDK-based networks while maintaining Ethereum compatibility, making the wallet an ideal choice for users and developers to interact with Polkadot Hub.

SubWallet now fully supports the [Polkadot Hub TestNet](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/networks/#test-networks){target=\_blank} where developers can deploy and interact with Ethereum-compatible, Solidity smart contracts.

You can easily view and manage your Paseo native token (PAS) using the Ethereum RPC endpoint (Passet Hub EVM) or the Substrate node RPC endpoint (passet-hub).

??? code "Polkadot Hub TestNet"
    You can see support here for Polkadot Hub's TestNet. The **Passet Hub EVM** network uses an ETH RPC endpoint, and the **passet-hub** uses a Substrate endpoint.
    The ETH RPC endpoint will let you send transactions that follow an ETH format, while the Substrate endpoint will follow a Substrate transaction format.
    Note the PAS token, which is the native token of the Polkadot Hub TestNet.

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/wallets/subwallet-PAS.webp){: .browser-extension}

To connect to Polkadot Hub TestNet using SubWallet, follow these steps:

1. Install the [SubWallet browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/subwallet-polkadot-wallet/onhogfjeacnfoofkfgppdlbmlmnplgbn?hl=en){target=\_blank} and set up your wallet by following the on-screen instructions, or refer to our [step-by-step guide](https://docs.subwallet.app/main/extension-user-guide/getting-started/install-subwallet){target=\_blank} for assistance.

2. After setting up your wallet, click the List icon at the top left corner of the extension window to open **Settings**.

Page Title: Web3.js

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/develop-smart-contracts-libraries-web3-js.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-js/
- Summary: Learn how to interact with Polkadot Hub using Web3.js, deploying Solidity contracts, and interacting with deployed smart contracts.

# Web3.js

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
!!! warning
    Web3.js has been [sunset](https://blog.chainsafe.io/web3-js-sunset/){target=\_blank}. You can find guides on using [Ethers.js](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/ethers-js){target=\_blank} and [viem](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/viem){target=\_blank} in the [Libraries](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/){target=\_blank} section. 

## Introduction

Interacting with blockchains typically requires an interface between your application and the network. [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/){target=\_blank} offers this interface through a comprehensive collection of libraries, facilitating seamless interaction with the nodes using HTTP or WebSocket protocols. This guide illustrates how to utilize Web3.js specifically for interactions with Polkadot Hub.

This guide is intended for developers who are familiar with JavaScript and want to interact with the Polkadot Hub using Web3.js.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.13.1 or later, check the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/){target=\_blank}.
- **npm**: v6.13.4 or later (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **Solidity**: This guide uses Solidity `^0.8.9` for smart contract development.

## Project Structure

This project organizes contracts, scripts, and compiled artifacts for easy development and deployment.

```text title="Web3.js Polkadot Hub"
web3js-project
├── contracts
│   ├── Storage.sol
├── scripts
│   ├── connectToProvider.js
│   ├── fetchLastBlock.js
│   ├── compile.js
│   ├── deploy.js
│   ├── updateStorage.js
├── abis
│   ├── Storage.json
├── artifacts
│   ├── Storage.polkavm
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

## Set Up the Project

To start working with Web3.js, begin by initializing your project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## Install Dependencies

Next, install the Web3.js library:

```bash
npm install web3
```

This guide uses `web3` version `4.16.0`.

## Set Up the Web3 Provider

The provider configuration is the foundation of any Web3.js application. The following example establishes a connection to Polkadot Hub. To use the example script, replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, and `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME` with the appropriate values. The provider connection script should look something like this:

```javascript title="scripts/connectToProvider.js"
const { Web3 } = require('web3');

const createProvider = (rpcUrl) => {
  const web3 = new Web3(rpcUrl);
  return web3;
};

const PROVIDER_RPC = {
  rpc: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
  chainId: 'INSERT_CHAIN_ID',
  name: 'INSERT_CHAIN_NAME',
};

createProvider(PROVIDER_RPC.rpc);

```

For example, for the Polkadot Hub TestNet, use these specific connection parameters:

```js
const PROVIDER_RPC = {
  rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
  chainId: 420420422,
  name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet'
};
```

With the Web3 provider set up, you can start querying the blockchain.

For instance, to fetch the latest block number of the chain, you can use the following code snippet:

???+ code "View complete script"

    ```javascript title="scripts/fetchLastBlock.js"
    const { Web3 } = require('web3');

    const createProvider = (rpcUrl) => {
      const web3 = new Web3(rpcUrl);
      return web3;
    };

    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
      rpc: 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
      chainId: 420420422,
      name: 'polkadot-hub-testnet',
    };

    const main = async () => {
      try {
        const web3 = createProvider(PROVIDER_RPC.rpc);
        const latestBlock = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();
        console.log('Last block: ' + latestBlock);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + error.message);
      }
    };

    main();

    ```

## Compile Contracts

!!! note "Contracts Code Blob Size Disclaimer"
    The maximum contract code blob size on Polkadot Hub networks is _100 kilobytes_, significantly larger than Ethereum’s EVM limit of 24 kilobytes.

    For detailed comparisons and migration guidelines, see the [EVM vs. PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/evm-vs-polkavm/#current-memory-limits){target=\_blank} documentation page.

Polkadot Hub requires contracts to be compiled to [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design/){target=\_blank} bytecode. This is achieved using the [`revive`](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/tree/v0.2.0/js/resolc){target=\_blank} compiler. Install the [`@parity/resolc`](https://github.com/paritytech/revive){target=\_blank} library as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @parity/resolc
```

This guide uses `@parity/resolc` version `0.2.0`.

Here's a simple storage contract that you can use to follow the process:

```solidity title="contracts/Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

With that, you can now create a `compile.js` snippet that transforms your solidity code into PolkaVM bytecode:

```javascript title="scripts/compile.js"
const { compile } = require('@parity/resolc');
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync } = require('fs');
const { basename, join } = require('path');

const compileContract = async (solidityFilePath, outputDir) => {
  try {
    // Read the Solidity file
    const source = readFileSync(solidityFilePath, 'utf8');

    // Construct the input object for the compiler
    const input = {
      [basename(solidityFilePath)]: { content: source },
    };

    console.log(`Compiling contract: ${basename(solidityFilePath)}...`);

    // Compile the contract
    const out = await compile(input);

    for (const contracts of Object.values(out.contracts)) {
      for (const [name, contract] of Object.entries(contracts)) {
        console.log(`Compiled contract: ${name}`);

        // Write the ABI
        const abiPath = join(outputDir, `${name}.json`);
        writeFileSync(abiPath, JSON.stringify(contract.abi, null, 2));
        console.log(`ABI saved to ${abiPath}`);

        // Write the bytecode
        const bytecodePath = join(outputDir, `${name}.polkavm`);
        writeFileSync(
          bytecodePath,
          Buffer.from(contract.evm.bytecode.object, 'hex'),
        );
        console.log(`Bytecode saved to ${bytecodePath}`);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error compiling contracts:', error);
  }
};

const solidityFilePath = './Storage.sol';
const outputDir = '.';

compileContract(solidityFilePath, outputDir);

```

To compile your contract, simply run the following command:

```bash
node compile
```

After compilation, you'll have two key files: an ABI (`.json`) file, which provides a JSON interface describing the contract's functions and how to interact with it, and a bytecode (`.polkavm`) file, which contains the low-level machine code executable on PolkaVM that represents the compiled smart contract ready for blockchain deployment.

## Contract Deployment

To deploy your compiled contract to Polkadot Hub using Web3.js, you'll need an account with a private key to sign the deployment transaction. The deployment process is exactly the same as for any Ethereum-compatible chain, involving creating a contract instance, estimating gas, and sending a deployment transaction. Here's how to deploy the contract, ensure replacing the `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INSERT_CONTRACT_NAME` with the appropriate values:

```javascript title="scripts/deploy.js"
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { Web3 } from 'web3';

const getAbi = (contractName) => {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(readFileSync(`${contractName}.json`), 'utf8');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      `❌ Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
      error.message
    );
    throw error;
  }
};

const getByteCode = (contractName) => {
  try {
    return `0x${readFileSync(`${contractName}.polkavm`).toString('hex')}`;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      `❌ Could not find bytecode for contract ${contractName}:`,
      error.message
    );
    throw error;
  }
};

export const deploy = async (config) => {
  try {
    // Initialize Web3 with RPC URL
    const web3 = new Web3(config.rpcUrl);

    // Prepare account
    const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(config.privateKey);
    web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);

    // Load abi
    const abi = getAbi('Storage');

    // Create contract instance
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);

    // Prepare deployment
    const deployTransaction = contract.deploy({
      data: getByteCode('Storage'),
      arguments: [], // Add constructor arguments if needed
    });

    // Estimate gas
    const gasEstimate = await deployTransaction.estimateGas({
      from: account.address,
    });

    // Get current gas price
    const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();

    // Send deployment transaction
    const deployedContract = await deployTransaction.send({
      from: account.address,
      gas: gasEstimate,
      gasPrice: gasPrice,
    });

    // Log and return contract details
    console.log(`Contract deployed at: ${deployedContract.options.address}`);
    return deployedContract;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Deployment failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Example usage
const deploymentConfig = {
  rpcUrl: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
  privateKey: 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY',
  contractName: 'INSERT_CONTRACT_NAME',
};

deploy(deploymentConfig)
  .then((contract) => console.log('Deployment successful'))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Deployment error'));

```

For further details on private key exportation, refer to the article [How to export an account's private key](https://support.metamask.io/configure/accounts/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/){target=\_blank}.

To deploy your contract, run the following command:

```bash
node deploy

## Interact with the Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with your contract using Web3.js methods. Here's how to set a number and read it back, ensure replacing `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the appropriate values:

```javascript title="scripts/updateStorage.js"
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { Web3 } from 'web3';

const getAbi = (contractName) => {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(readFileSync(`${contractName}.json`), 'utf8');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      `❌ Could not find ABI for contract ${contractName}:`,
      error.message
    );
    throw error;
  }
};

const updateStorage = async (config) => {
  try {
    // Initialize Web3 with RPC URL
    const web3 = new Web3(config.rpcUrl);

    // Prepare account
    const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(config.privateKey);
    web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);

    // Load abi
    const abi = getAbi('Storage');

    // Create contract instance
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, config.contractAddress);

    // Get initial value
    const initialValue = await contract.methods.storedNumber().call();
    console.log('Current stored value:', initialValue);

    // Prepare transaction
    const updateTransaction = contract.methods.setNumber(1);

    // Estimate gas
    const gasEstimate = await updateTransaction.estimateGas({
      from: account.address,
    });

    // Get current gas price
    const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();

    // Send update transaction
    const receipt = await updateTransaction.send({
      from: account.address,
      gas: gasEstimate,
      gasPrice: gasPrice,
    });

    // Log transaction details
    console.log(`Transaction hash: ${receipt.transactionHash}`);

    // Get updated value
    const newValue = await contract.methods.storedNumber().call();
    console.log('New stored value:', newValue);

    return receipt;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Update failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Example usage
const config = {
  rpcUrl: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
  privateKey: 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY',
  contractAddress: 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
};

updateStorage(config)
  .then((receipt) => console.log('Update successful'))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Update error'));

```

To execute the logic above, run:

```bash
node updateStorage
```

# Web3.py

!!! smartcontract "PolkaVM Preview Release"
    PolkaVM smart contracts with Ethereum compatibility are in **early-stage development and may be unstable or incomplete**.
## Introduction

Interacting with blockchains typically requires an interface between your application and the network. [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html){target=\_blank} offers this interface through a collection of libraries, facilitating seamless interaction with the nodes using HTTP or WebSocket protocols. 

This guide illustrates how to utilize Web3.py for interactions with Polkadot Hub.

## Set Up the Project

1. To start working with Web3.py, begin by initializing your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir web3py-project
    cd web3py-project
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment for your project:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Next, install the Web3.py library:

    ```bash
    pip install web3
    ```

## Set Up the Web3 Provider

The [provider](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html){target=\_blank} configuration is the foundation of any Web3.py application. The following example establishes a connection to Polkadot Hub. Follow these steps to use the provider configuration:

1. Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL` with the appropriate value. For instance, to connect to Polkadot Hub TestNet, use the following parameter:

    ```python
    PROVIDER_RPC = 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'
    ```

    The provider connection script should look something like this:

    ```python title="connect_to_provider.py"
    from web3 import Web3

    def create_provider(rpc_url):
        web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))
        return web3

    PROVIDER_RPC = 'INSERT_RPC_URL'

    create_provider(PROVIDER_RPC)
    ```

1. With the Web3 provider set up, start querying the blockchain. For instance, you can use the following code snippet to fetch the latest block number of the chain:

    ```python title="fetch_last_block.py"
    def main():
        try:
            web3 = create_provider(PROVIDER_RPC)
            latest_block = web3.eth.block_number
            print('Last block: ' + str(latest_block))
        except Exception as error:
            print('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + str(error))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    ??? code "View complete script"

        ```python title="fetch_last_block.py"
        from web3 import Web3

        def create_provider(rpc_url):
            web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))
            return web3

        PROVIDER_RPC = 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'

        def main():
            try:
                web3 = create_provider(PROVIDER_RPC)
                latest_block = web3.eth.block_number
                print('Last block: ' + str(latest_block))
            except Exception as error:
                print('Error connecting to Polkadot Hub TestNet: ' + str(error))

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

## Contract Deployment

Before deploying your contracts, make sure you've compiled them and obtained two key files:

- An ABI (.json) file, which provides a JSON interface describing the contract's functions and how to interact with it.
- A bytecode (.polkavm) file, which contains the low-level machine code executable on [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design#polkavm){target=\_blank} that represents the compiled smart contract ready for blockchain deployment.

To follow this guide, you can use the following solidity contract as an example:

```solidity title="Storage.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
// It will be used by the Solidity compiler to validate its version.
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    // Public state variable to store a number
    uint256 public storedNumber;

    /**
    * Updates the stored number.
    *
    * The `public` modifier allows anyone to call this function.
    *
    * @param _newNumber - The new value to store.
    */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        storedNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

To deploy your compiled contract to Polkadot Hub using Web3.py, you'll need an account with a private key to sign the deployment transaction. The deployment process is exactly the same as for any Ethereum-compatible chain, involving creating a contract instance, estimating gas, and sending a deployment transaction. Here's how to deploy the contract. Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL` and `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` with the appropriate values:

```python title="deploy.py"
from web3 import Web3
import json

def get_abi(contract_name):
    try:
        with open(f"{contract_name}.json", 'r') as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"❌ Could not find ABI for contract {contract_name}: {error}")
        raise error

def get_bytecode(contract_name):
    try:
        with open(f"{contract_name}.polkavm", 'rb') as file:
            return '0x' + file.read().hex()
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"❌ Could not find bytecode for contract {contract_name}: {error}")
        raise error

async def deploy(config):
    try:
        # Initialize Web3 with RPC URL
        web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(config["rpc_url"]))
        
        # Prepare account
        account = web3.eth.account.from_key(config["private_key"])
        print(f"address: {account.address}")
        
        # Load ABI
        abi = get_abi('Storage')
        
        # Create contract instance
        contract = web3.eth.contract(abi=abi, bytecode=get_bytecode('Storage'))
        
        # Get current nonce
        nonce = web3.eth.get_transaction_count(account.address)
        
        # Prepare deployment transaction
        transaction = {
            'from': account.address,
            'nonce': nonce,
        }
        
        # Build and sign transaction
        construct_txn = contract.constructor().build_transaction(transaction)
        signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(construct_txn, private_key=config["private_key"])
        
        # Send transaction
        tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.raw_transaction)
        print(f"Transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")
        
        # Wait for transaction receipt
        tx_receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
        contract_address = tx_receipt.contractAddress
        
        # Log and return contract details
        print(f"Contract deployed at: {contract_address}")
        return web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)
    
    except Exception as error:
        print('Deployment failed:', error)
        raise error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    import asyncio
    
    deployment_config = {
        "rpc_url": "INSERT_RPC_URL",
        "private_key": "INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY",
    }
    
    asyncio.run(deploy(deployment_config))
```

!!!warning
    Never commit or share your private key. Exposed keys can lead to immediate theft of all associated funds. Use environment variables instead.

## Interact with the Contract

After deployment, interact with your contract using Web3.py methods. The example below demonstrates how to set and retrieve a number. Be sure to replace the `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` placeholders with your specific values:

```python title="update_storage.py"
from web3 import Web3
import json

def get_abi(contract_name):
    try:
        with open(f"{contract_name}.json", 'r') as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"❌ Could not find ABI for contract {contract_name}: {error}")
        raise error

async def update_storage(config):
    try:
        # Initialize Web3 with RPC URL
        web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(config["rpc_url"]))
        
        # Prepare account
        account = web3.eth.account.from_key(config["private_key"])
        
        # Load ABI
        abi = get_abi('Storage')
        
        # Create contract instance
        contract = web3.eth.contract(address=config["contract_address"], abi=abi)
        
        # Get initial value
        initial_value = contract.functions.storedNumber().call()
        print('Current stored value:', initial_value)
        
        # Get current nonce
        nonce = web3.eth.get_transaction_count(account.address)
        
        # Prepare transaction
        transaction = contract.functions.setNumber(1).build_transaction({
            'from': account.address,
            'nonce': nonce
        })
        
        # Sign transaction
        signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(transaction, private_key=config["private_key"])
        
        # Send transaction
        tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.raw_transaction)
        print(f"Transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")
        
        # Wait for receipt
        receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
        
        # Get updated value
        new_value = contract.functions.storedNumber().call()
        print('New stored value:', new_value)
        
        return receipt
    
    except Exception as error:
        print('Update failed:', error)
        raise error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    import asyncio
    
    config = {
        "rpc_url": "INSERT_RPC_URL",
        "private_key": "INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "contract_address": "INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
    }
    
    asyncio.run(update_storage(config))
```

Page Title: XCM Channels

- Source (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/master/ai/pages/develop-interoperability-xcm-channels.md
- Canonical (HTML): https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/
- Summary: Learn how Polkadot's cross-consensus messaging (XCM) channels connect parachains, facilitating communication and blockchain interaction.

# XCM Channels

## Introduction

Polkadot is designed to enable interoperability between its connected parachains. At the core of this interoperability is the [Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank}, a standard language that allows parachains to communicate and interact with each other.

The network-layer protocol responsible for delivering XCM-formatted messages between parachains is the [Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#xcmp-cross-chain-message-passing){target=\_blank} protocol. XCMP maintains messaging queues on the relay chain, serving as a bridge to facilitate cross-chain interactions.

As XCMP is still under development, Polkadot has implemented a temporary alternative called [Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#hrmp-xcmp-lite){target=\_blank}. HRMP offers the same interface and functionality as the planned XCMP but it has a crucial difference, it stores all messages directly in the relay chain's storage, which is more resource-intensive.

Once XCMP is fully implemented, HRMP will be deprecated in favor of the native XCMP protocol. XCMP will offer a more efficient and scalable solution for cross-chain message passing, as it will not require the relay chain to store all the messages.

## Establishing HRMP Channels

To enable communication between parachains using the HRMP protocol, the parachains must explicitly establish communication channels by registering them on the relay chain.

Downward and upward channels from and to the relay chain are implicitly available, meaning they do not need to be explicitly opened.

Opening an HRMP channel requires the parachains involved to make a deposit on the relay chain. This deposit serves a specific purpose, it covers the costs associated with using the relay chain's storage for the message queues linked to the channel. The amount of this deposit varies based on parameters defined by the specific relay chain being used.

### Relay Chain Parameters

Each Polkadot relay chain has a set of configurable parameters that control the behavior of the message channels between parachains. These parameters include [`hrmpSenderDeposit`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/configuration/struct.HostConfiguration.html#structfield.hrmp_sender_deposit){target=\_blank}, [`hrmpRecipientDeposit`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/configuration/struct.HostConfiguration.html#structfield.hrmp_recipient_deposit){target=\_blank}, [`hrmpChannelMaxMessageSize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/configuration/struct.HostConfiguration.html#structfield.hrmp_channel_max_message_size){target=\_blank}, [`hrmpChannelMaxCapacity`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/configuration/struct.HostConfiguration.html#structfield.hrmp_channel_max_capacity){target=\_blank}, and more.

When a parachain wants to open a new channel, it must consider these parameter values to ensure the channel is configured correctly.

To view the current values of these parameters in the Polkadot network:

1. Visit [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer), navigate to the **Developer** dropdown and select the **Chain state** option.

    ![](/images/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/xcm-channels-1.webp)

2. Query the chain configuration parameters. The result will display the current settings for all the Polkadot network parameters, including the HRMP channel settings.

    1. Select **`configuration`**.
    2. Choose the **`activeConfig()`** call.
    3. Click the **+** button to execute the query.
    4. Check the chain configuration.

        ![](/images/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/xcm-channels-2.webp)

### Dispatching Extrinsics

Establishing new HRMP channels between parachains requires dispatching specific extrinsic calls on the Polkadot Relay Chain from the parachain's origin.

The most straightforward approach is to implement the channel opening logic off-chain, then use the XCM pallet's [`send`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/dispatchables/fn.send.html){target=\_blank} extrinsic to submit the necessary instructions to the relay chain. However, the ability to send arbitrary programs through the [`Transact`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#transact){target=\_blank} instruction in XCM is typically restricted to privileged origins, such as the [`sudo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_sudo/pallet/dispatchables/fn.sudo.html){target=\_blank} pallet or governance mechanisms.

Parachain developers have a few options for triggering the required extrinsic calls from their parachain's origin, depending on the configuration and access controls defined:

- **Sudo**: If the parachain has a `sudo` pallet configured, the sudo key holder can use the sudo extrinsic to dispatch the necessary channel opening calls.
- **Governance**: The parachain's governance system, such as a council or OpenGov, can be used to authorize the channel opening calls.
- **Privileged accounts**: The parachain may have other designated privileged accounts that are allowed to dispatch the HRMP channel opening extrinsics.

# XCM Config

## Introduction

The [XCM executor](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/index.html){target=\_blank} is a crucial component responsible for interpreting and executing XCM messages (XCMs) with Polkadot SDK-based chains. It processes and manages XCM instructions, ensuring they are executed correctly and in sequentially. Adhering to the [Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM) specification](https://paritytech.github.io/xcm-docs/overview/xcvm.html#the-xcvm){target=\_blank}, the XCM executor can be customized or replaced with an alternative that also complies with the [XCVM standards](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#12-the-xcvm){target=\_blank}.

The `XcmExecutor` is not a pallet but a struct parameterized by a `Config` trait. The `Config` trait is the inner configuration, parameterizing the outer `XcmExecutor<Config>` struct. Both configurations are set up within the runtime.

The executor is highly configurable, with the [XCM builder](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/index.html){target=\_blank} offering building blocks to tailor the configuration to specific needs. While they serve as a foundation, users can easily create custom blocks to suit unique configurations. Users can also create their building blocks to address unique needs. This article examines the XCM configuration process, explains each configurable item, and provides examples of the tools and types available to help customize these settings.

## XCM Executor Configuration

The `Config` trait defines the XCM executor’s configuration, which requires several associated types. Each type has specific trait bounds that the concrete implementation must fulfill. Some types, such as `RuntimeCall`, come with a default implementation in most cases, while others use the unit type `()` as the default. For many of these types, selecting the appropriate implementation carefully is crucial. Predefined solutions and building blocks can be adapted to your specific needs. These solutions can be found in the [`xcm-builder`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/polkadot-stable2506-2/polkadot/xcm/xcm-builder){target=\_blank} folder.

Each type is explained below, along with an overview of some of its implementations:

```rust
pub trait Config {
    type RuntimeCall: Parameter + Dispatchable<PostInfo = PostDispatchInfo> + GetDispatchInfo;
    type XcmSender: SendXcm;
    type AssetTransactor: TransactAsset;
    type OriginConverter: ConvertOrigin<<Self::RuntimeCall as Dispatchable>::RuntimeOrigin>;
    type IsReserve: ContainsPair<MultiAsset, MultiLocation>;
    type IsTeleporter: ContainsPair<MultiAsset, MultiLocation>;
    type Aliasers: ContainsPair<Location, Location>;
    type UniversalLocation: Get<InteriorMultiLocation>;
    type Barrier: ShouldExecute;
    type Weigher: WeightBounds<Self::RuntimeCall>;

## Config Items

Each configuration item is explained below, detailing the associated type’s purpose and role in the XCM executor. Many of these types have predefined solutions available in the `xcm-builder`. Therefore, the available configuration items are:

- **[`RuntimeCall`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.RuntimeCall){target=\_blank}**: Defines the runtime's callable functions, created via the [`frame::runtime`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/attr.runtime.html){target=\_blank} macro. It represents an enum listing the callable functions of all implemented pallets.

    ```rust
    type RuntimeCall: Parameter + Dispatchable<PostInfo = PostDispatchInfo> + GetDispatchInfo
    ```
   The associated traits signify:

    - **`Parameter`**: Ensures the type is encodable, decodable, and usable as a parameter.
    - **`Dispatchable`**: Indicates it can be executed in the runtime.
    - **`GetDispatchInfo`**: Provides weight details, determining how long execution takes.

- **[`XcmSender`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmSender){target=\_blank}**: Implements the [`SendXcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v4/trait.SendXcm.html){target=\_blank} trait, specifying how the executor sends XCMs using transport layers (e.g., UMP for relay chains or XCMP for sibling chains). If a runtime lacks certain transport layers, such as [HRMP](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#hrmp-xcmp-lite){target=\_blank} (or [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#xcmp-cross-consensus-message-passing-design-summary){target=\_blank}).

    ```rust
    type XcmSender: SendXcm;
    ```

- **[`AssetTransactor`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.AssetTransactor){target=\_blank}**: Implements the [`TransactAsset`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/traits/trait.TransactAsset.html){target=\_blank} trait, handling the conversion and transfer of MultiAssets between accounts or registers.

    ```rust
    type AssetTransactor: TransactAsset;
    ```

- **[`OriginConverter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.OriginConverter){target=\_blank}**: Implements the [`ConvertOrigin`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/traits/trait.ConvertOrigin.html){target=\_blank} trait to map `MultiLocation` origins to `RuntimeOrigin`. Multiple implementations can be combined, and [`OriginKind`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/test_utils/enum.OriginKind.html){target=\_blank} is used to resolve conflicts. Pre-defined converters like [`SovereignSignedViaLocation`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/struct.SovereignSignedViaLocation.html){target=\_blank} and [`SignedAccountId32AsNative`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/struct.SignedAccountId32AsNative.html){target=\_blank} handle sovereign and local accounts respectively.

    ```rust
    type OriginConverter: ConvertOrigin<<Self::RuntimeCall as Dispatchable>::RuntimeOrigin>;
    ```

Using `()` blocks the [`ReceiveTeleportedAssets`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/test_utils/enum.Instruction.html#variant.ReceiveTeleportedAsset){target=\_blank} instruction. The [`NativeAsset`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/struct.NativeAsset.html){target=\_blank} struct can act as an implementation.

    ```rust
    type IsTeleporter: ContainsPair<MultiAsset, MultiLocation>;
    ```

- **[`Aliasers`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.Aliasers){target=\_blank}**: A list of `(Origin, Target)` pairs enabling each `Origin` to be replaced with its corresponding `Target`.

    ```rust

Multiple barriers can be combined in a tuple, where execution halts if one succeeds.

    ```rust
    type Barrier: ShouldExecute;
    ```

- **[`Weigher`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.Weigher){target=\_blank}**: Calculates the weight of XCMs and instructions, enforcing limits and refunding unused weight. Common solutions include [`FixedWeightBounds`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/struct.FixedWeightBounds.html){target=\_blank}, which uses a base weight and limits on instructions.

    ```rust
    type Weigher: WeightBounds<Self::RuntimeCall>;
    ```

- **[`Trader`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.Trader){target=\_blank}**: Manages asset-based weight purchases and refunds for `BuyExecution` instructions.

FRAME systems typically use the pallet-xcm implementation.

    ```rust
    type ResponseHandler: OnResponse;
    ```

- **[`AssetTrap`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.AssetTrap){target=\_blank}**: Handles leftover assets in the holding register after XCM execution, allowing them to be claimed via `ClaimAsset`. If unsupported, assets are burned.

    ```rust
    type AssetTrap: DropAssets;
    ```

- **[`AssetClaims`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.AssetClaims){target=\_blank}**: Facilitates the claiming of trapped assets during the execution of the `ClaimAsset` instruction. Commonly implemented via pallet-xcm.

The unit type `()` disables this functionality.

    ```rust
    type AssetExchanger: AssetExchange;
    ```

- **[`SubscriptionService`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.SubscriptionService){target=\_blank}**: Manages `(Un)SubscribeVersion` instructions and returns the XCM version via `QueryResponse`. Typically implemented by pallet-xcm.

    ```rust
    type SubscriptionService: VersionChangeNotifier;
    ```

- **[`PalletInstancesInfo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.PalletInstancesInfo){target=\_blank}**: Provides runtime pallet information for `QueryPallet` and `ExpectPallet` instructions. FRAME-specific systems often use this, or it can be disabled with `()`.

    ```rust
    type PalletInstancesInfo: PalletsInfoAccess;
    ```

 
- [**`MaxAssetsIntoHolding`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.MaxAssetsIntoHolding){target=\_blank}: Limits the number of assets in the [Holding register](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/#holding-register){target=\_blank}. At most, twice this limit can be held under worst-case conditions.
    ```rust
    type MaxAssetsIntoHolding: Get<u32>;
    ```

- **[`FeeManager`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.FeeManager){target=\_blank}**: Manages fees for XCM instructions, determining whether fees should be paid, waived, or handled in specific ways. Fees can be waived entirely using `()`.

    ```rust
    type FeeManager: FeeManager;
    ```

- **[`MessageExporter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.MessageExporter){target=\_blank}**: Implements the [`ExportXcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/traits/trait.ExportXcm.html){target=\_blank} trait, enabling XCMs export to other consensus systems. It can spoof origins for use in bridges. Use `()` to disable exporting.

Using `Everything` allows all calls, though this is temporary until proof size weights are accounted for.

    ```rust
    type SafeCallFilter: Contains<Self::RuntimeCall>;
    ```

- **[`TransactionalProcessor`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.TransactionalProcessor){target=\_blank}**: Implements the [`ProccessTransaction`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/traits/trait.ProcessTransaction.html){target=\_blank} trait. It ensures that XCM instructions are executed atomically, meaning they either fully succeed or fully fail without any partial effects. This type allows for non-transactional XCM instruction processing by setting the `()` type.

    ```rust
    type TransactionalProcessor: ProcessTransaction;
    ```

- **[`HrmpNewChannelOpenRequestHandler`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.HrmpNewChannelOpenRequestHandler){target=\_blank}**: Enables optional logic execution in response to the `HrmpNewChannelOpenRequest` XCM notification.

    ```rust
    type HrmpChannelClosingHandler: HandleHrmpChannelClosing;
    ```

- **[`XcmRecorder`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmRecorder){target=\_blank}**: Allows tracking of the most recently executed XCM, primarily for use with dry-run runtime APIs.

    ```rust
    type XcmRecorder: RecordXcm;
    ```

### Inner Config

The `Config` trait underpins the `XcmExecutor`, defining its core behavior through associated types for asset handling, XCM processing, and permission management. These types are categorized as follows:

- **Handlers**: Manage XCMs sending, asset transactions, and special notifications.
- **Filters**: Define trusted combinations, origin substitutions, and execution barriers.
- **Converters**: Handle origin conversion for call execution.
- **Accessors**: Provide weight determination and pallet information.
- **Constants**: Specify universal locations and asset limits.
- **Common Configs**: Include shared settings like `RuntimeCall`.

The following diagram outlines this categorization:

```mermaid

    D --> AC[OriginConverter]

    E --> AD[Weigher]
    E --> AE[PalletInstancesInfo]

    F --> AF[UniversalLocation]
    F --> AG[MaxAssetsIntoHolding]

    G --> AH[RuntimeCall]
```

### Outer Config

The `XcmExecutor<Config>` struct extends the functionality of the inner config by introducing fields for execution context, asset handling, error tracking, and operational management. For further details, see the documentation for [`XcmExecutor<Config>`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/struct.XcmExecutor.html#impl-XcmExecutor%3CConfig%3E){target=\_blank}.

## Multiple Implementations

Some associated types in the `Config` trait are highly configurable and may have multiple implementations (e.g., Barrier). These implementations are organized into a tuple `(impl_1, impl_2, ..., impl_n)`, and the execution follows a sequential order. Each item in the tuple is evaluated individually, each being checked to see if it fails. If an item passes (e.g., returns `Ok` or `true`), the execution stops, and the remaining items are not evaluated. The following example of the `Barrier` type demonstrates how this grouping operates (understanding each item in the tuple is unnecessary for this explanation).

In the following example, the system will first check the `TakeWeightCredit` type when evaluating the barrier. If it fails, it will check `AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom`, and so on, until one of them returns a positive result. If all checks fail, a Barrier error will be triggered.

```rust
pub type Barrier = (
    TakeWeightCredit,
    AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom<Everything>,
    AllowKnownQueryResponses<XcmPallet>,
    AllowSubscriptionsFrom<Everything>,
);

pub struct XcmConfig;
impl xcm_executor::Config for XcmConfig {
    ...
    type Barrier = Barrier;
    ...
}
```

# XCM Runtime APIs

## Introduction

Runtime APIs allow node-side code to extract information from the runtime state. While simple storage access retrieves stored values directly, runtime APIs enable arbitrary computation, making them a powerful tool for interacting with the chain's state.

Unlike direct storage access, runtime APIs can derive values from storage based on arguments or perform computations that don't require storage access. For example, a runtime API might expose a formula for fee calculation, using only the provided arguments as inputs rather than fetching data from storage.

In general, runtime APIs are used for:

- Accessing a storage item.
- Retrieving a bundle of related storage items.
- Deriving a value from storage based on arguments.
- Exposing formulas for complex computational calculations.

This section will teach you about specific runtime APIs that support XCM processing and manipulation.

## Dry Run API

The [Dry-run API](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/xcm_runtime_apis/dry_run/trait.DryRunApi.html){target=\_blank}, given an extrinsic, or an XCM program, returns its effects:

- Execution result
- Local XCM (in the case of an extrinsic)
- Forwarded XCMs
- List of events

This API can be used independently for dry-running, double-checking, or testing. However, it mainly shines when used with the [Xcm Payment API](#xcm-payment-api), given that it only estimates fees if you know the specific XCM you want to execute or send.

### Dry Run Call

This API allows a dry-run of any extrinsic and obtaining the outcome if it fails or succeeds, as well as the local xcm and remote xcm messages sent to other chains.

```rust
fn dry_run_call(origin: OriginCaller, call: Call, result_xcms_version: XcmVersion) -> Result<CallDryRunEffects<Event>, Error>;
```

??? interface "Input parameters"

    `origin` ++"OriginCaller"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>
    
    The origin used for executing the transaction.

    ---

    `call` ++"Call"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    The extrinsic to be executed.

    ---

??? interface "Output parameters"

    ++"Result<CallDryRunEffects<Event>, Error>"++

    Effects of dry-running an extrinsic. If an error occurs, it is returned instead of the effects.

    ??? child "Type `CallDryRunEffects<Event>`"

        `execution_result` ++"DispatchResultWithPostInfo"++

        The result of executing the extrinsic.

        ---

        `emitted_events` ++"Vec<Event>"++

        The list of events fired by the extrinsic.

        ---

        `local_xcm` ++"Option<VersionedXcm<()>>"++

        The local XCM that was attempted to be executed, if any.

        ---

        `forwarded_xcms` ++"Vec<(VersionedLocation, Vec<VersionedXcm<()>>)>"++

        The list of XCMs that were queued for sending.

    ??? child "Type `Error`"

        Enum:

        - **`Unimplemented`**: An API part is unsupported.
        - **`VersionedConversionFailed`**: Converting a versioned data structure from one version to another failed.

??? interface "Example"

    This example demonstrates how to simulate a cross-chain asset transfer from the Paseo network to the Pop Network using a [reserve transfer](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-usecases/#reserve-asset-transfer){target=\_blank} mechanism. Instead of executing the actual transfer, the code shows how to test and verify the transaction's behavior through a dry run before performing it on the live network.

    Replace `INSERT_USER_ADDRESS` with your SS58 address before running the script.

    ***Usage with PAPI***

    ```js
    import { paseo } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
    import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
    import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider/web';
    import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';

    const userAddress = 'INSERT_USER_ADDRESS';
    const userPublicKey = ss58Decode(userAddress)[0];
    const idBeneficiary = Binary.fromBytes(userPublicKey);

    // Define the origin caller
    // This is a regular signed account owned by a user
    let origin = PolkadotRuntimeOriginCaller.system(
      DispatchRawOrigin.Signed(userAddress),
    );

    // Define a transaction to transfer assets from Polkadot to Pop Network using a Reserve Transfer
    const tx = paseoApi.tx.XcmPallet.limited_reserve_transfer_assets({
      dest: XcmVersionedLocation.V3({
        parents: 0,
        interior: XcmV3Junctions.X1(
          XcmV3Junction.Parachain(popParaID), // Destination is the Pop Network parachain
        ),
      }),
      beneficiary: XcmVersionedLocation.V3({

            network: undefined,
            id: idBeneficiary,
          }),
        ),
      }),
      assets: XcmVersionedAssets.V3([
        {
          id: XcmV3MultiassetAssetId.Concrete({
            parents: 0,
            interior: XcmV3Junctions.Here(), // Native asset from the sender. In this case PAS
          }),
          fun: XcmV3MultiassetFungibility.Fungible(120000000000n), // Asset amount to transfer
        },
      ]),
      fee_asset_item: 0, // Asset used to pay transaction fees
      weight_limit: XcmV3WeightLimit.Unlimited(), // No weight limit on transaction
    });

    // Execute the dry run call to simulate the transaction
    const dryRunResult = await paseoApi.apis.DryRunApi.dry_run_call(
      origin,
      tx.decodedCall,
    );

    // Extract the data from the dry run result
    const {
      execution_result: executionResult,
      emitted_events: emmittedEvents,
      local_xcm: localXcm,
      forwarded_xcms: forwardedXcms,
    } = dryRunResult.value;

    // Extract the XCM generated by this call
    const xcmsToPop = forwardedXcms.find(
      ([location, _]) =>
        location.type === 'V4' &&
        location.value.parents === 0 &&
        location.value.interior.type === 'X1' &&
        location.value.interior.value.type === 'Parachain' &&
        location.value.interior.value.value === popParaID, // Pop network's ParaID
    );
    const destination = xcmsToPop[0];

### Dry Run XCM

This API allows the direct dry-run of an xcm message instead of an extrinsic one, checks if it will execute successfully, and determines what other xcm messages will be forwarded to other chains.

```rust
fn dry_run_xcm(origin_location: VersionedLocation, xcm: VersionedXcm<Call>) -> Result<XcmDryRunEffects<Event>, Error>;
```

??? interface "Input parameters"

    `origin_location` ++"VersionedLocation"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    The location of the origin that will execute the xcm message.

    ---

    `xcm` ++"VersionedXcm<Call>"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    A versioned XCM message.

    ---

??? interface "Output parameters"

    ++"Result<XcmDryRunEffects<Event>, Error>"++

    Effects of dry-running an extrinsic. If an error occurs, it is returned instead of the effects.

    ??? child "Type `XcmDryRunEffects<Event>`"

        `execution_result` ++"DispatchResultWithPostInfo"++

        The result of executing the extrinsic.

        ---

        `emitted_events` ++"Vec<Event>"++

        The list of events fired by the extrinsic.

        ---

        `forwarded_xcms` ++"Vec<(VersionedLocation, Vec<VersionedXcm<()>>)>"++

        The list of XCMs that were queued for sending.

    ??? child "Type `Error`"

        Enum:

        - **`Unimplemented`**: An API part is unsupported.
        - **`VersionedConversionFailed`**: Converting a versioned data structure from one version to another failed.

    ---

??? interface "Example"

    This example demonstrates how to simulate a [teleport asset transfer](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-usecases/#asset-teleportation){target=\_blank} from the Paseo network to the Paseo Asset Hub parachain. The code shows how to test and verify the received XCM message's behavior in the destination chain through a dry run on the live network.

    Replace `INSERT_USER_ADDRESS` with your SS58 address before running the script.

## XCM Payment API

The [XCM Payment API](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/xcm_runtime_apis/fees/trait.XcmPaymentApi.html){target=\_blank} provides a standardized way to determine the costs and payment options for executing XCM messages. Specifically, it enables clients to:

- Retrieve the [weight](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight) required to execute an XCM message.
- Obtain a list of acceptable `AssetIds` for paying execution fees.
- Calculate the cost of the weight in a specified `AssetId`.
- Estimate the fees for XCM message delivery.

This API eliminates the need for clients to guess execution fees or identify acceptable assets manually. Instead, clients can query the list of supported asset IDs formatted according to the XCM version they understand. With this information, they can weigh the XCM program they intend to execute and convert the computed weight into its cost using one of the acceptable assets.

To use the API effectively, the client must already know the XCM program to be executed and the chains involved in the program's execution.

### Query Acceptable Payment Assets

Retrieves the list of assets that are acceptable for paying fees when using a specific XCM version

```rust
fn query_acceptable_payment_assets(xcm_version: Version) -> Result<Vec<VersionedAssetId>, Error>;
```

??? interface "Input parameters"

    `xcm_version` ++"Version"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    Specifies the XCM version that will be used to send the XCM message.

    ---

??? interface "Output parameters"

    ++"Result<Vec<VersionedAssetId>, Error>"++

    A list of acceptable payment assets. Each asset is provided in a versioned format (`VersionedAssetId`) that matches the specified XCM version. If an error occurs, it is returned instead of the asset list.

    ??? child "Type `Error`"

        Enum:

        - **`Unimplemented`**: An API part is unsupported.
        - **`VersionedConversionFailed`**: Converting a versioned data structure from one version to another failed.
        - **`WeightNotComputable`**: XCM message weight calculation failed.
        - **`UnhandledXcmVersion`**: XCM version not able to be handled.
        - **`AssetNotFound`**: The given asset is not handled as a fee asset.
        - **`Unroutable`**: Destination is known to be unroutable.

    ---

??? interface "Example"

    This example demonstrates how to query the acceptable payment assets for executing XCM messages on the Paseo Asset Hub network using XCM version 3.

    ***Usage with PAPI***

    ```js
    import { paseoAssetHub } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
    import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
    import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider/web';
    import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';

    // Connect to the polkadot relay chain
    const client = createClient(
      withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('wss://asset-hub-paseo-rpc.dwellir.com')),
    );

    const paseoAssetHubApi = client.getTypedApi(paseoAssetHub);

    // Define the xcm version to use
    const xcmVersion = 3;

    // Execute the runtime call to query the assets
    const result =
      await paseoAssetHubApi.apis.XcmPaymentApi.query_acceptable_payment_assets(
        xcmVersion,
      );

    // Print the assets
    console.dir(result.value, { depth: null });

    client.destroy();

    ```

    ***Output***

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
      <pre>
        [
          {
            type: 'V3',
            value: {
              type: 'Concrete',
              value: { parents: 1, interior: { type: 'Here', value: undefined } }
            }

# XCM Tools

## Introduction

As described in the [Interoperability](/develop/interoperability){target=\_blank} section, XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) is a protocol used in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to enable communication and interaction between chains. It facilitates cross-chain communication, allowing assets, data, and messages to flow seamlessly across the ecosystem.

As XCM is central to enabling communication between blockchains, developers need robust tools to help interact with, build, and test XCM messages. Several XCM tools simplify working with the protocol by providing libraries, frameworks, and utilities that enhance the development process, ensuring that applications built within the Polkadot ecosystem can efficiently use cross-chain functionalities.

## Popular XCM Tools

### Moonsong Labs XCM Tools

[Moonsong Labs XCM Tools](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/xcm-tools){target=\_blank} provides a collection of scripts for managing and testing XCM operations between Polkadot SDK-based runtimes. These tools allow performing tasks like asset registration, channel setup, and XCM initialization. Key features include:

- **Asset registration**: Registers assets, setting units per second (up-front fees), and configuring error (revert) codes.
- **XCM initializer**: Initializes XCM, sets default XCM versions, and configures revert codes for XCM-related precompiles.
- **HRMP manipulator**: Manages HRMP channel actions, including opening, accepting, or closing channels.
- **XCM-Transactor-Info-Setter**: Configures transactor information, including extra weight and fee settings.
- **Decode XCM**: Decodes XCM messages on the relay chain or parachains to help interpret cross-chain communication.

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/xcm-tools && 
cd xcm-tools &&

### ParaSpell

[ParaSpell](https://paraspell.xyz/){target=\_blank} is a collection of open-source XCM tools designed to streamline cross-chain asset transfers and interactions within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. It equips developers with an intuitive interface to manage and optimize XCM-based functionalities. Some key points included by ParaSpell are:

- **[XCM SDK](https://paraspell.xyz/#xcm-sdk){target=\_blank}**: Provides a unified layer to incorporate XCM into decentralized applications, simplifying complex cross-chain interactions.
- **[XCM API](https://paraspell.xyz/#xcm-api){target=\_blank}**: Offers an efficient, package-free approach to integrating XCM functionality while offloading heavy computing tasks, minimizing costs and improving application performance.
- **[XCM router](https://paraspell.xyz/#xcm-router){target=\_blank}**: Enables cross-chain asset swaps in a single command, allowing developers to send one asset type (such as DOT on Polkadot) and receive a different asset on another chain (like ASTR on Astar).
- **[XCM analyser](https://paraspell.xyz/#xcm-analyser){target=\_blank}**: Decodes and translates complex XCM multilocation data into readable information, supporting easier troubleshooting and debugging.
- **[XCM visualizator](https://paraspell.xyz/#xcm-visualizator){target=\_blank}**: A tool designed to give developers a clear, interactive view of XCM activity across the Polkadot ecosystem, providing insights into cross-chain communication flow.

ParaSpell's tools make it simple for developers to build, test, and deploy cross-chain solutions without needing extensive knowledge of the XCM protocol. With features like message composition, decoding, and practical utility functions for parachain interactions, ParaSpell is especially useful for debugging and optimizing cross-chain communications.

### Astar XCM Tools

The [Astar parachain](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/tree/master){target=\_blank} offers a crate with a set of utilities for interacting with the XCM protocol. The [xcm-tools](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/tree/master/bin/xcm-tools){target=\_blank} crate provides a straightforward method for users to locate a sovereign account or calculate an XC20 asset ID. Some commands included by the xcm-tools crate allow users to perform the following tasks:

- **Sovereign accounts**: Obtain the sovereign account address for any parachain, either on the Relay Chain or for sibling parachains, using a simple command.
- **XC20 EVM addresses**: Generate XC20-compatible Ethereum addresses for assets by entering the asset ID, making it easy to integrate assets across Ethereum-compatible environments.
- **Remote accounts**: Retrieve remote account addresses needed for multi-location compatibility, using flexible options to specify account types and parachain IDs.

To start using these tools, clone the [Astar repository](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar){target=\_blank} and compile the xcm-tools package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar &&
cd Astar &&
cargo build --release -p xcm-tools
```

After compiling, verify the setup with the following command:

```bash
./target/release/xcm-tools --help
```
For more details on using Astar xcm-tools, consult the [official documentation](https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/interoperability/xcm/integration/tools/){target=\_blank}.

### Chopsticks

The Chopsticks library provides XCM functionality for testing XCM messages across networks, enabling you to fork multiple parachains along with a relay chain. For further details, see the [Chopsticks documentation](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/){target=\_blank} about XCM.

### Moonbeam XCM SDK

The [Moonbeam XCM SDK](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk){target=\_blank} enables developers to easily transfer assets between chains, either between parachains or between a parachain and the relay chain, within the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. With the SDK, you don't need to worry about determining the [Multilocation](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#7-universal-consensus-location-identifiers){target=\_blank} of the origin or destination assets or which extrinsics are used on which networks.

The SDK consists of two main packages:

- **[XCM SDK](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/tree/main/packages/sdk){target=\_blank}**: Core SDK for executing XCM transfers between chains in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.
- **[MRL SDK](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/tree/main/packages/mrl){target=\_blank}**: Extension of the XCM SDK for transferring liquidity into and across the Polkadot ecosystem from other ecosystems like Ethereum.

Key features include:

- **Simplified asset transfers**: Abstracts away complex multilocation determinations and extrinsic selection.
- **Cross-ecosystem support**: Enables transfers between Polkadot/Kusama chains and external ecosystems.
- **Developer-friendly API**: Provides intuitive interfaces for cross-chain functionality.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Includes usage guides and API references for both packages.
