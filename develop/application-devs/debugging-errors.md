# Troubleshooting Common Errors

Errors in Polkadot SDK-based chains are typically accompanied by descriptive messages. To interpret these messages, tools that parse blockchain data must request _chain metadata_ from a node, which provides the necessary information to decode them. One such tool is the [Polkadot.js Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps){target=\_blank}, which includes a built-in parser for chain metadata that allows error messages to be displayed in a human-readable format.

This page provides an overview of essential tools, like Polkadot.js Apps, to help you identify and resolve common issues and offers practical solutions for frequently encountered errors.

If this page doesn't answer your question, try searching for your problem at the [Polkadot Knowledge Base](https://support.polkadot.network/){target=\_blank} for more information on troubleshooting.

## Polkadot.js Apps Explorer

If a transaction submitted through Polkadot.js Apps fails, notifications will temporarily appear in the top-right corner of the screen. These notifications will inform you that the transaction has been included in a block, that it has failed, and will display any events emitted during the failed execution. The `ExtrinsicFailed` event indicates when a transaction doesn't succeed.

Refer to the image below to see examples of these notifications:

The image displays only the error name defined in the code without the full error message. To access the error message, you must first identify the block containing your transaction. The easiest way to do this is by using [Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/){target=\_blank} to check your account activity.

Once you have the block number, query it from the [Polkadot.js Apps Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank}. Alternatively, you can view the error details directly on Subscan (see the [following section](#subscan) for instructions).

After querying the block, you'll see a list of extrinsics. Scroll through the list to find the call you made. Look for the associated **system.ExtrinsicFailed** event and expand it to review the detailed error information.

!!! note
    You can view [the block on Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws#/explorer/query/19983878){target=\_blank} containing the failed extrinsic in the preceding image. You'll need to scroll down to the **staking.nominate** extrinsic and expand the **system.ExtrinsicFailed** event to see the error details.

Notice how the **details** field contains a human-readable description of the error. Most errors will have this if looked up this way.

If the error isn't listed or the **details** field is empty, refer to the table in the [Common Errors](#common-errors) section. You can also look up the **index** and **error**, as shown in the **dispatchError** section, in the codebase using the steps in the [Runtime Errors](#runtime-errors) section to diagnose the issue.

## Subscan

In addition to Polkadot.js Apps, the [Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/){target=\_blank} block explorer is another powerful tool for accessing and interpreting error messages on Polkadot SDK-based chains.

Whenever an extrinsic fails, an `ExtrinsicFailed` event will be emitted. If you're unsure of the block or extrinsic hash of the failed extrinsic, you can query your account's address, and it'll be listed under the **Extrinsics** tab on your account page. On the extrinsic detail page, you can scroll down to the **Events** tab towards the bottom and expand the **system(ExtrinsicFailed)** event to view the error details.

!!!note
    To view the preceding example directly in Subscan, head to the [extrinsic page for 19983862-2](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/19983878-2?event=19983878-53){target=\_blank}.

This event contains a human-readable description of the error in the **doc** row. Most errors will have this if looked up this way.

If the error isn't listed or the **doc** field is empty, refer to the table in the [Common Errors](#common-errors) section. You can also look up the **index** and **error** in the codebase using the steps in the [Runtime Errors](#runtime-errors) section to diagnose the issue.

!!!note "Future Error"

    This error will not cause the transaction to be discarded immediately. Instead, it will be sent to the future queue, where it will wait to be executed at the correct place in the nonce sequence, or it will be discarded due to some other error (e.g., the validity period expires).

## Runtime Errors

Runtime errors in Polkadot SDK-based chains provide valuable insights into issues encountered during transaction execution. Understanding these errors is essential for diagnosing problems effectively. This section outlines how to view error details for specific pallets, as well as how to decipher dispatch errors to identify the source pallet and the error of the issue.

### View Error Details

The runtime errors for a particular pallet can be viewed in one of several ways:

1. Referring to the [`polkadot_sdk_docs`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/index.html){target=\_blank} for that pallet, where the errors can be found, for example, [`pallet_balances`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/pallet/enum.Error.html#variants){target=\_blank}
2. Referring to [Subscan's runtime section](https://polkadot.subscan.io/runtime){target=\_blank}, where the pallet can be selected and viewed

### Deciphering Dispatch Errors

If you receive a dispatch error, it will include the index of the pallet from which the error originated and the specific index of the error within that pallet's error definitions. Both of these indices start counting from zero.

#### Trace the Error to Its Originating Pallet

Runtime errors can be located by examining the runtime's codebase. For Polkadot, this involves checking the [Polkadot Fellows Runtime repository](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/){target=\_blank} and the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank} repository.

As an example, consider the following dispatch error:

```js
{
  Module: {
    index: 7
    error: 0x07000000
  }
}
```

You can see that the module index number is `7`, but the error is a hex string that you must convert to a decimal. The first byte, `07`, represents the index of the error. You'll need to convert `0x07` to a decimal, which ends up being `7`. So now you know that `7` is the index of the pallet, and `7` is the index of the error for that pallet in this example.

You can view a list of the runtime's pallets and associated indices in the Polkadot Fellows Runtimes repository in the [`relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` file](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/main/relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}. You'll look in this file for `pub enum Runtime`, which is where you'll see each pallet and its associated index. You'll find that the Staking pallet is at index `7`.

#### Identify the Specific Error from the Pallet

Now that you've identified the error occurred in the Staking pallet, you'll need to review the list of possible errors. You can do this by either checking the [Staking pallet's documentation](https://docs.rs/pallet-staking/latest/pallet_staking/enum.Error.html#variants){target=\_blank} or by exploring the Staking pallet's source code.

For example, if you check the eighth variant in the [Staking pallet's error list](https://docs.rs/pallet-staking/latest/pallet_staking/enum.Error.html#variants){target=\_blank} (seventh index), you'll find **`InsufficientBond`**, indicating that the error you encountered is due to an insufficient bond.

!!! note
    To use the documentation method for another pallet, you'll need the pallet's name since the [Rust documentation](https://docs.rs/){target=\_blank} covers the entire Rust ecosystem, not just Polkadot. The convention for finding the pallet is `pallet_<PALLET_NAME>`. Once you've located the correct documentation, search for "error," which should lead you to the `Error` enum, typically formatted as `pallet_<PALLET_NAME>::Error`. You can then review the list of errors.

To use the source code method, navigate to the [`substrate/frame/staking/` directory](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/staking/){target=\_blank} of the Polkadot SDK repository. For the Staking pallet, the errors are defined in the [`substrate/fram/staking/src/pallet/mod.rs` file](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/staking/src/pallet/mod.rs){target=\_blank}. Look for `pub enum Error`, and look at the eighth error (seventh index), you'll find `InsufficientBond`.

!!! note
    The `Error` enum location can vary between pallets. In some cases, it may be defined in the `src/lib.rs` file within the `substrate/frame/<PALLET_NAME>` directory.
