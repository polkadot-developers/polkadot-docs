Polkadot doesn't support smart contracts natively. Rather, parachains secured by Polkadot are equipped with the functionality to support smart contracts.

The two primary supported smart contract environments are [ink!](#ink) and EVM. There are multiple [parachains that support both environments](#smart-contract-environments).

## Developing a Smart Contract Versus a Parachain

!!!info "For a more technical/thorough breakdown, refer to the [`polkadot_sdk_docs`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/runtime_vs_smart_contract/index.html){target=\_blank}"

[When should one build a Substrate (Polkadot SDK) runtime versus a Substrate (Polkadot SDK) smart contract](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56041305){target=\_blank}? This post also answers the question more technically of when a developer might choose to develop a runtime versus a smart contract.

### Layer of Abstraction

When you write a smart contract, you are creating the instructions that associate with and deploy on
a specific chain address.

In comparison, a runtime module on a parachain is the entire logic of a chain's state transitions (what's called a state transition function).

Smart contracts must consciously implement a path to upgrading in the future, while parachains have the ability to swap out their code through a forkless upgrade.

When you build a smart contract, it will eventually be deployed to a target chain with its own environment. Parachains allow the developer to declare the environment of their own chain, even allowing others to write smart contracts for it.

The concept of *gas*, or *fees* in general, also are approached differently between the two. Smart contracts are bound by the gas-metering model, whereas runtimes (and their subsequent modules) are much more flexible in terms of the fee models that can be employed.

## Building a Smart Contract

The relay chain doesn't support smart contracts natively. However, since the parachains that connect to it can support arbitrary state transitions, they can also support smart contracts.

The Polkadot SDK presently supports smart contracts out-of-the-box in several ways:

- The EVM pallet offered by [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier){target=\_blank}
- The [contracts pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/contracts/){target=\_blank} in the FRAME library for Wasm-based contracts

### Frontier EVM Contracts

[Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) is the suite of tools that enables a Polkadot SDK-based chain to run Ethereum contracts (EVM) natively with the same API/RPC interface. Ethereum addresses can also be mapped directly to and from the Polkadot SDK's SS58 scheme from existing accounts.

- [Pallet EVM](https://docs.rs/pallet-evm/latest/pallet_evm/){target=\_blank} - enables functionality of running EVM (Solidity) contracts
- [Pallet Ethereum](https://docs.rs/pallet-ethereum/latest/pallet_ethereum/){target=\_blank} - Ethereum RPC implementation, block emulation, and Ethereum transaction validation

### Contracts Pallet

The contracts pallet (`pallet_contracts`) implements a Wasm based approach to smart contracts.

1. **Wasm**. The contracts pallet uses Wasm as its compilation target. Any language that
   compiles to Wasm can potentially be used to write smart contracts. Nevertheless, it is better to
   have a dedicated domain-specific language, and for that reason Parity offers the [ink!](#ink)
   language.

2. **Deposit** - contracts must hold a deposit (named `_ContractDeposit_` ) suitably large enough to justify their existence on-chain. The developer must deposit this into the new contract on top of the `_ExistentialDeposit_`

3. **Caching** - contracts are cached by default, and therefore means they only need to be deployed once and afterward be instantiated as many times as you want. This helps keep the chain's storage load down to the minimum. On top of this, when a contract is no longer being used and the `_existential deposit_` is drained, the code will be erased from storage (known as reaping)

### Ink

[ink!](https://github.com/use-ink/ink){target=\_blank} is a domain specific language for writing smart contracts in Rust and compiles to Wasm code.

Here is the list of current resources available to developers who want to get started writing smart contracts to deploy on parachains based on Substrate.

- [ink!](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank} - Polkadot's "native" smart contract stack, based on Wasm
- [OpenBrush](https://docs.openbrush.io/){target=\_blank} - an `ink!` library providing standard contracts based on [PSP](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs){target=\_blank} with useful contracts and macros for building
- [ink!athon](https://inkathon.xyz/){target=\_blank} - starter kit for full-stack dApps with ink! smart contracts and frontend

ink! has laid much of the groundwork for a new smart contract stack that is based on a Wasm virtual machine and compatible with Polkadot SDK-based chains.

## Smart Contract Environments

Many smart contract platforms are building to become a parachain in the ecosystem. A community created and maintained list of different smart contract platforms can be found at [PolkaProjects](https://www.polkaproject.com/#/projects?cateID=1&tagID=6){target=\_blank}. Additionally, information about ink smart contracts can be accessed at [use.ink](https://use.ink/#where-can-i-deploy-ink-contracts){target=\_blank}.
