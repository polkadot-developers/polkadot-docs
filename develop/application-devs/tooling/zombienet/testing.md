# Testing DSL

Zombienet provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing tests. The DSL is designed to be human-readable and allows you to write tests using natural language expressions. You can define assertions and tests against the spawned network using this DSL. This way, users can evaluate different metrics, such as:

- **On-chain storage** - the storage of each of the chains running via Zombienet
- **Metrics** - the metrics provided by the nodes
- **Histograms** - visual representations of metrics data
- **Logs** - detailed records of system activities and events
- **System events** - notifications of significant occurrences within the network
- **Tracing** - detailed analysis of execution paths and operations
- **Custom API calls (through Polkadot.js)** - personalized interfaces for interacting with the network
- **Commands** - instructions or directives executed by the network

These abstractions are expressed by sentences defined in a natural language style. Therefore, each test line will be mapped to a test to run. Also, the test file (`*.zndsl`) includes pre-defined header fields used to define information about the suite, such as network configuration and credentials location.

## The Test File

### Name

The test name in Zombienet is derived from the file name by removing any leading numeric characters before the first hyphen. For example, a file named `0001-zombienet-test.zndsl` will result in a test name of `zombienet-test`, which will be displayed in the test report output of the runner.

### Structure

The test file is a text file with the extension `.zndsl`. It is divided into two parts: the header and the body. The header contains the network configuration and the credentials to use, while the body contains the tests to run.

The header is defined by the following fields:

- `description` ++"string"++ - long description of the test suite (optional)
- `network` ++"string"++ - path to the network definition file, supported in both `.json` and `.toml` formats
- `creds` ++"string"++ - credentials file name or path to use (available only with Kubernetes provider). Looks in the current directory or `$HOME/.kube/` if a file name is passed

The body contains the tests to run. Each test is defined by a sentence in the DSL, which is mapped to a test to run. Each test line defines an assertion or a command to be executed against the spawned network.

### Assertions

Assertions are defined by sentences in the DSL that evaluate different metrics, such as on-chain storage, metrics, histograms, logs, system events, tracing, and custom API calls. Each assertion is defined by a sentence in the DSL, which is mapped to a test to run.

    === "Syntax"

        - `sleep x`

## Example

For example, the following test file defines two tests: a small network test and a big network test. Each test defines a network configuration file and credentials to use.

The tests define assertions to evaluate the networkâ€™s metrics and logs. The assertions are defined by sentences in the DSL, which are mapped to tests to run.

```toml
Description: Small Network test
Network: ./0000-test-config-small-network.toml
Creds: config

# metrics
alice: reports node_roles is 4
alice: reports sub_libp2p_is_major_syncing is 0

# logs
bob: log line matches glob "*rted #1*" within 10 seconds
bob: log line matches "Imported #[0-9]+" within 10 seconds
```

And the second test file:

```toml
Description: Big Network test
Network: ./0001-test-config-big-network.toml
Creds: config

# metrics
alice: reports node_roles is 4
alice: reports sub_libp2p_is_major_syncing is 0

# logs
bob: log line matches glob "*rted #1*" within 10 seconds
bob: log line matches "Imported #[0-9]+" within 10 seconds

# custom js script
alice: js-script ./0008-custom.js return is greater than 1 within 200 seconds

# custom ts script
alice: ts-script ./0008-custom-ts.ts return is greater than 1 within 200 seconds

# backchannel
alice: wait for name and use as X within 30 seconds

# well know functions
alice: is up
alice: parachain 100 is registered within 225 seconds
alice: parachain 100 block height is at least 10 within 250 seconds

# histogram
alice: reports histogram polkadot_pvf_execution_time has at least 2 samples in buckets ["0.1", "0.25", "0.5", "+Inf"] within 100 seconds

# system events
alice: system event matches ""paraId":[0-9]+" within 10 seconds

# tracing
alice: trace with traceID 94c1501a78a0d83c498cc92deec264d9 contains ["answer-chunk-request", "answer-chunk-request"]
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests using the local provider (`native`), you can use the Zombienet binary. The binary will read the test files and execute the tests defined in the DSL. The binary will output the results of the tests in the console.

```bash
zombienet -p native test INSERT_TEST_FILE_NAME
```

!!! note
    Replace `INSERT_TEST_FILE_NAME` with the path to the test file you want to run.
