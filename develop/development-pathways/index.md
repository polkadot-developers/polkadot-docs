# Development Pathways

## Introduction

Developers can choose from different development pathways to build applications and core blockchain functionality. Each pathway caters to different types of projects and developer skill sets, while complementing one another within the broader network.

The Polkadot ecosystem provides multiple development pathways:

## Smart Contract Development

Smart contracts are sandboxed programs that run within a virtual machine on the blockchain. These deterministic pieces of code are deployed at specific blockchain addresses and execute predefined logic when triggered by transactions. Because they run in an isolated environment, they provide enhanced security and predictable execution. Smart contracts can be deployed permissionlessly, allowing any developer to create and launch applications without requiring special access or permissions. They enable developers to create trustless applications by encoding rules, conditions, and state transitions that leverage the security and transparency of the underlying blockchain.

Some key benefits of developing smart contracts include ease of development, faster time to market, and permissionless deployment. Smart contracts allow developers to quickly build and deploy decentralized applications without complex infrastructure or intermediaries. This accelerates the development lifecycle and enables rapid innovation within the Polkadot ecosystem.

For more information on developing smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem, check the [Smart Contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/overview){target=\_blank} section.

## Blockchain Development

[Runtimes](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#runtime){target=\_blank} are the core building blocks that define the logic and functionality of Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. Developers can customize and extend the features of their blockchain, allowing for tighter integration with critical network tasks such as block production, consensus mechanisms, and governance processes.

Runtimes can be upgraded through forkless runtime updates, enabling seamless evolution of the blockchain without disrupting existing functionality.

Developers can define the parameters, rules, and behaviors that shape their blockchain network. This includes token economics, transaction fees, permissions, and more. Using the Polkadot SDK, teams can iterate on their blockchain designs, experiment with new features, and deploy highly specialized networks tailored to their specific use cases.

For those interested in delving deeper into runtime development, explore the dedicated [Custom Blockchains](/develop/blockchains/custom-blockchains){target=\_blank} section.

## Client-Side Development

The client-side development path is dedicated to building applications that interact with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains and enhance user engagement with the network. While decentralized applications (dApps) are a significant focus, this pathway also includes developing other tools and interfaces that expand users' interactions with blockchain data and services.

Client-side developers can build:

- **Decentralized applications (dApps)** - these applications leverage the blockchain's smart contracts or runtimes to offer a wide range of features, from financial services to gaming and social applications, all accessible directly by end-users

- **Command-line interfaces (CLIs)** - CLI tools empower developers and technical users to interact with the blockchain programmatically. These tools enable tasks like querying the blockchain, deploying smart contracts, managing wallets, and monitoring network status

- **Data analytics and visualization tools** - developers can create tools that aggregate, analyze, and visualize on-chain data to help users and businesses understand trends, track transactions, and gain insights into the network's health and usage

- **Wallets** - securely managing accounts and private keys is crucial for blockchain users. Client-side development includes building user-friendly wallets, account management tools, and extensions that integrate seamlessly with the ecosystem

- **Explorers and dashboards** -  blockchain explorers allow users to view and search on-chain data, including blocks, transactions, and accounts. Dashboards provide a more interactive interface for users to monitor critical metrics, such as staking rewards, governance proposals, and network performance

These applications can leverage the Polkadot blockchain's underlying protocol features to create solutions that allow users to interact with the ecosystem. The Client-side development pathway is ideal for developers interested in enhancing user experiences and building applications that bring the power of decentralized networks to a broader audience.
