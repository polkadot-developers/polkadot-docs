# Develop and Deploy with Polkadot

Explore development pathways and learn how to build in the Polkadot ecosystem. Robust integrations and developer tools are available to support individuals and teams building custom blockchain functionality, writing and deploying smart contracts, and developing user-facing applications.

These sections build upon learnings from the [Polkadot Protocol](/polkadot-protocol){target=\_blank} section with the essential information, and practical examples, you need to put your knowledge to work and meet your development goals.

- **Blockchain developers** -  learn how to develop, deploy, operate, and maintain custom blockchains with the [Polkadot SDK](/develop/blockchains/get-started/intro-polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank}
- **Smart contract developers** - learn about smart contract development with tools to support Wasm and Solidity, using familiar EVM-compatible tools to write and deploy your contracts
- **Application developers** - learn how to use familiar wallets, indexers, and oracles to integrate your applications with the Polkadot ecosystem
