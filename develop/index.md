# Develop and Deploy with Polkadot

Polkadot offers a unique platform for developers to build the next generation of blockchain solutions. Whether you're developing a custom parachain, deploying smart contracts, or crafting user-facing applications, the Polkadot ecosystem provides the tools, frameworks, and infrastructure to bring your vision to life.

This section builds on concepts from the [Polkadot Protocol](/polkadot-protocol){target=\_blank} section and provides the practical knowledge and resources needed to design, deploy, and operate scalable solutions in the Polkadot ecosystem. By leveraging Polkadot's unique features, such as interoperability and decentralized security, developers can build applications and infrastructure tailored to their needs.

## Choose Your Development Path

- **Parachain developers** - build, deploy, and maintain custom parachains with the Polkadot SDK. From runtime customization to network operations, learn how to create a scalable and efficient parachain

    - **Where to start** - [Introduction to the Polkadot SDK](/develop/blockchains/get-started/intro-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}

- **Smart contract developers** - utilize Polkadot's support for Wasm-based contracts with ink!, or deploy Solidity contracts on EVM-compatible parachains. Leverage familiar tools to write, test, and manage decentralized logic

    - **Where to start** - [Overview of the Smart Contract Landscape on Polkadot](/develop/smart-contracts/overview/){target=\_blank}

- **Application developers** - integrate your applications with the Polkadot ecosystem using wallets, oracles, indexers, and more. Explore guides on how to leverage Polkadot's decentralized infrastructure to deliver high-performing, user-facing solutions

    - **Where to start** - [Polkadot Ecosystem Toolkit](/develop/toolkit/){target=\_blank}

- **Cross-chain developers** - harness Polkadot’s interoperability features to enable secure communication and asset transfers across blockchains. Leverage Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) to create innovative cross-chain workflows and applications

    - **Where to start** - [Introduction to XCM](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank}
