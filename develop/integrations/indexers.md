# Indexers

## The Challenge of Blockchain Data Access

Blockchain data is inherently sequential and distributed, with information stored chronologically across numerous blocks. While retrieving data from a single block through JSON-RPC API calls is straightforward, more complex queries that span multiple blocks present significant challenges:

- Data is scattered and unorganized across the blockchain
- Retrieving large datasets can take days or weeks to sync
- Complex operations (like aggregations, averages, or cross-chain queries) require additional processing
- Direct blockchain queries can impact dApp performance and responsiveness

## What is a Blockchain Indexer?

A blockchain indexer is a specialized infrastructure tool that processes, organizes, and stores blockchain data in an optimized format for efficient querying. Think of it as a search engine for blockchain data that:

- Continuously monitors the blockchain for new blocks and transactions
- Processes and categorizes this data according to predefined schemas
- Stores the processed data in an easily queryable database
- Provides efficient APIs (typically [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/){target=\_blank}) for data retrieval

## Indexer Implementations

-   :material-clock-fast:{ .lg .middle } __Subsquid__

    ---

    Subsquid is a data network that allows rapid and cost-efficient retrieval of blockchain data from 100+ chains using Subsquid's decentralized data lake and open-source SDK. In simple terms, Subsquid can be considered an ETL (extract, transform, and load) tool with a GraphQL server included. It enables comprehensive filtering, pagination, and even full-text search capabilities. Subsquid has native and full support for EVM and Substrate data, even within the same project.
