# Wallets

## What is a Blockchain Wallet?

A wallet serves as your gateway to interacting with blockchain networks. Rather than storing funds, wallets secure your private keys, controlling access to your blockchain assets. Your private key provides complete control over all permitted transactions on your blockchain account, making it essential to keep it secure.

Wallet types fall into two categories based on their connection to the internet:

- [**Hot Wallets**](#hot-wallets) - online storage through websites, browser extensions or smartphone apps
- [**Cold Wallets**](#cold-wallets) - offline storage using hardware devices or air-gapped systems
