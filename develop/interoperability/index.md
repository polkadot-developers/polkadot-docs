# Interoperability

Learn how Polkadot enables blockchain interoperability through XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging), powering secure cross-chain communication.

These sections will introduce you to Polkadot's XCM messaging format for cross-chain communication. You will learn how XCM channels facilitate connections between parachains and how to configure XCM for your custom runtime. Finally, you'll learn how to use tools like the `xcm_simulator` to create a testing and experimentation playground environment.
