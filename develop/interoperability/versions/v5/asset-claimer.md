# Asset Claimer (XCM V4 â†’ XCM V5)

XCMv5 introduces the [`AssetClaimer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v5/enum.Hint.html#variant.AssetClaimer){target=\_blank} execution hint through [`SetHints`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v5/enum.Instruction.html#variant.SetHints){target=\_blank}, which significantly simplifies the process of recovering trapped assets when XCM execution fails.

## The problem before v5

When XCM execution failed and assets became trapped:

- **Governance dependency**: Most trapped asset recovery required governance proposals.
- **Complex procedures**: Manual intervention through referendum processes.
- **Long delays**: Recovery could take weeks or months through governance.
- **Risk of loss**: Assets could remain permanently trapped if governance didn't act.
- **High barriers**: Small amounts often weren't worth the governance overhead.

## The V5 Solution: `AssetClaimer` Hint

The new [`AssetClaimer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v5/enum.Hint.html#variant.AssetClaimer){target=\_blank} hint allows XCM programs to preemptively designate who can claim trapped assets:

```typescript
// Set asset claimer before risky operations
XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ 
  hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', claimerLocation)] 
})
```

## How it Improves the Situation

### Before XCM V5

```typescript
// If this XCM fails, assets become trapped
const riskyXcm = [
  XcmInstruction.WithdrawAsset([assets]),
  XcmInstruction.BuyExecution({ fees, weight_limit }),
  XcmInstruction.Transact({ /* risky call */ }),
  XcmInstruction.DepositAsset({ assets, beneficiary })
]

// Recovery required governance intervention
```

### With XCM V5

```typescript
// Proactive asset claimer setup
const saferXcm = [
  // Anyone can now claim if execution fails
  XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ 
    hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', claimerLocation)] 
  }),
  XcmV5Instruction.WithdrawAsset([assets]),
  XcmV5Instruction.PayFees({ asset }),
  XcmV5Instruction.Transact({ /* risky call */ }),
  XcmV5Instruction.DepositAsset({ assets, beneficiary })
]

// Recovery can be done immediately by the claimer
```

## Key Improvements

### Immediate Recovery

- **Before**: Wait for governance process (weeks/months).
- **After**: Designated claimer can act immediately.

### Reduced Governance Burden

- **Before**: Every trapped asset required a governance proposal.
- **After**: Only complex cases need governance intervention.

### Predictable Recovery

- **Before**: Uncertain if governance would approve recovery
- **After**: Predetermined claimer provides certainty

### Lower Barriers

- **Before**: Small amounts often not worth governance overhead.
- **After**: Any amount can be efficiently recovered.

## Best Practices

### Set Hint Early

```typescript
// Set claimer hint before any risky operations
XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', claimerLocation)] }),
// ... other instructions that might fail
```

### Use for Cross-Chain Transfers

Particularly useful for setting local accounts on destination chains:

```typescript
// In remote_xcm for cross-chain transfers
const remoteXcm = [
  XcmV5Instruction.SetHints({ 
    hints: [Enum('AssetClaimer', {
      parents: 0,
      interior: { X1: { AccountId32: { id: localAccountId } } }
    })] 
  }),
  // ... transfer instructions
]
```

### Consider Origin Preservation

When origin preservation is available, trapped assets are automatically associated with the original origin, making claiming easier without additional hints.

## Migration Impact

This change makes XCM programs more resilient and user-friendly:

- **Reduced risk**: Assets are less likely to be permanently lost.
- **Better UX**: Users can recover their own assets without waiting for governance.
- **Increased adoption**: Lower risk encourages more XCM usage.
- **Operational efficiency**: Reduces governance workload for routine recoveries.

The `AssetClaimer` hint represents a significant improvement in XCM's fault tolerance and user experience, making cross-chain operations safer and more predictable.
