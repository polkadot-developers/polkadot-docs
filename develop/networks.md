# Networks

## Introduction

The Polkadot ecosystem consists of multiple networks designed to support different stages of blockchain development, from main networks to test networks. Each network serves a unique purpose, providing developers with flexible environments for building, testing, and deploying blockchain applications.

## Main Networks

### Polkadot

- **Description** - primary production blockchain network for high-stakes, enterprise-grade applications
- **RPC URL** - `wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com`
- **Currency symbol** - `DOT`
- **Block explorer URL** - `https://polkadot.subscan.io/`
- **Network Characteristics:**
    - Highest security and stability
    - Full economic value
    - Supports production-ready parachains
    - Governed by the community through sophisticated governance mechanisms

### Kusama

- **Description** - pre-production environment for cutting-edge blockchain innovations
- **RPC URL** - `wss://kusama-rpc.dwellir.com`
- **Currency symbol** - `KSM`
- **Block explorer URL** - `https://kusama.subscan.io/.`
- **Network Characteristics:**
    - High-risk, experimental network
    - Faster governance and upgrade cycles
    - Lower economic barriers
    - Ideal for testing radical new features before Polkadot deployment
    - Motto: "Expect Chaos"

## Test Networks

### Westend


### Paseo



Westend - functionality equal to the current Polkadot mainnet, with possible next-generation testing of features from time to time that will eventually migrate onto Polkadot. Perma-testnet (is not reset back to genesis block).

Paseo - a community-run testnet which mirrors the Polkadot runtime. It is maintained by the community.
