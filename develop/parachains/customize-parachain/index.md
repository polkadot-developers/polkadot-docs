# Customize Your Parachain

Learn how to build a custom parachain with Polkadot SDK's FRAME framework, covering pallet development, testing, smart contracts, and runtime customization.

These sections take what you learned and built in [Get Started](/develop/blockchains/get-started){target=\_blank} and guide you through using the Polkadot SDK's tools to create a blockchain customized to the needs of your users and applications. Whether it's a custom configuration of existing modular pallets, a pallet of your own creation, or through adding smart contract functionality, everything you need for efficient runtime design and development is here.
