# Customize Your Parachain

Learn how to build a custom parachain with Polkadot SDK's FRAME framework, which includes pallet development, testing, smart contracts, and runtime customization. Pallets are modular components within the FRAME ecosystem that contain specific blockchain functionalities. This modularity grants developers increased flexibility and control around which behaviors to include in the core logic of their parachain.

The [FRAME directory](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame){target=\_blank} includes a robust library of pre-built pallets you can use as examples or templates to ease development.
