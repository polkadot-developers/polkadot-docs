# Deployment

## Prepare for Deployment

Learn how to prepare your blockchain for deployment using the Polkadot SDK, including building deterministic Wasm runtimes and generating chain specifications. The Polkadot SDK helps streamline this process by providing the following tools:

- [**Substrate Runtime Toolbox (srtool)**](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool){target=\_blank} - a collection of containerized tools to help with building Wasm runtimes for Polkadot Network
- [**GenericChainSpec struct**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_chain_spec/struct.GenericChainSpec.html){target=\_blank} - a standardized struct for configuring chains and building a genesis block

## Get Started

These sections continue to build on your progress by guiding you through the steps to get your tested, custom blockchain deployed for use by your applications and users. You will learn about essential processes like building needed binaries, customizing and distributing chain specifications, and how to secure computational resources for your chain by obtaining coretime.
