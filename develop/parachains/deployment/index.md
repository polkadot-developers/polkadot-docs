# Deployment

Learn how to prepare your blockchain for deployment using the Polkadot SDK, including building deterministic Wasm runtimes and generating chain specifications.

These sections continue to build on your progress by guiding you through the steps to get your tested, custom blockchain deployed for use by your applications and users. You will learn about essential processes like building needed binaries, customizing and distributing chain specifications, and how to secure computational resources for your chain by obtaining coretime.
