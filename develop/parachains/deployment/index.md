# Deployment

Learn how to prepare your blockchain for deployment using the Polkadot SDK, including building deterministic Wasm runtimes and generating chain specifications.

To better understand the deployment process, check out the following section. If you're ready to start jump to [In This Section](#in-this-section) to begin working through the deployment guides.

## Deployment Process

Taking your Polkadot SDK-based blockchain from a local environment to production involves several steps, ensuring your network is stable, secure, and ready for real-world use. The following diagram outlines the process at a high level:

    %% Group 1: Pre-Deployment
    subgraph group1 [Pre-Deployment]
        direction LR
        A("Local \nDevelopment \nand Testing") --> B("Runtime \nCompilation")
        B --> C("Generate \nChain \nSpecifications")
        C --> D("Prepare \nDeployment \nEnvironment")
        D --> E("Acquire \nCoretime")
    end
    
    %% Group 2: Deployment
    subgraph group2 [Deployment]
        F("Launch \nand \nMonitor")
    end

    %% Group 3: Post-Deployment
    subgraph group3 [Post-Deployment]
        G("Maintenance \nand \nUpgrades")
    end

    %% Connections Between Groups
    group1 --> group2
    group2 --> group3

    %% Styling

    style group3 fill:#ffffff,stroke:#6e7391,stroke-width:1px
```
