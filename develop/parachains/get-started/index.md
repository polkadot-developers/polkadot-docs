# Get Started

## Polkadot SDK Benefits

Learn how to start building with the Polkadot SDK, from installation and basic concepts to creating and deploying your custom blockchain. This powerful and versatile developer kit is designed to facilitate building on the Polkadot network. 

Features developers can expect from the Polkadot SDK include:

- Networking and peer-to-peer communication (powered by [Libp2p](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#libp2p){target=\_blank})
- Consensus protocols
- Cryptography
- A robust library of pre-built pallets (modules)
- Benchmarking and testing suites

## Get Started

In these sections, you'll begin with an overview of the Polkadot SDK and its components. Next, get your developer environment ready with guidance on installing the Polkadot SDK and related dependencies. Once you're ready to build, learn how to use pre-built chain templates to streamline development. Finally, find the information you need to configure and deploy a custom chain to Polkadot.
