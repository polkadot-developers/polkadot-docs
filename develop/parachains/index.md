# Parachains

This section provides a complete guide to working with the Polkadot SDK, from getting started to long-term network maintenance. Discover how to create custom blockchains, test and deploy your parachains, and ensure their continued performance and reliability.

## Building Parachains with the Polkadot SDK

With the [Polkadot relay chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/){target=\_blank} handling security and consensus, parachain developers are free to focus on features such as asset management, governance, and cross-chain communication. The Polkadot SDK equips developers with the tools to build, deploy, and maintain efficient, scalable parachains.

Polkadot SDKâ€™s FRAME framework provides developers with the tools to do the following:

- **Customize parachain runtimes** - [runtimes](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#runtime){target=\_blank} are the core building blocks that define the logic and functionality of Polkadot SDK-based parachains and let developers customize the parameters, rules, and behaviors that shape their blockchain network
- **Develop new pallets** - create custom modular pallets to define runtime behavior and acheive desired blockchain functionality
- **Add smart contract functionality** - use specialized pallets to deploy and execute smart contracts, enhancing your chain's functionality and programmability
- **Test your build for a confident deployment** - create a test environment that can simulate runtime and mock transaction execution
- **Deploy your blockchain for use** - take your Polkadot SDK-based blockchain from a local environment to production
- **Maintain your network including monitoring and upgrades** - runtimes can be ugraded through forkless runtime updates, enabling seamless evolution of the parachain
