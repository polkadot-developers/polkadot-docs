# Parachains

This section provides a complete guide to working with the Polkadot SDK, from getting started to long-term network maintenance. Discover how to create custom blockchains, test and deploy your parachains, and ensure their continued performance and reliability.

## Building Parachains with the Polkadot SDK

With the [Polkadot relay chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/){target=\_blank} handling security and consensus, parachain developers are free to focus on features such as asset management, governance, and cross-chain communication. The Polkadot SDK equips developers with the tools to build, deploy, and maintain efficient, scalable parachains.

Polkadot SDK’s FRAME framework provides developers with the tools to do the following:

- Customize parachain runtimes
- Develop new pallets
- Add smart contract functionality
- Test your build for a confident deployment
- Deploy your blockchain for use
- Maintain your network inlcuding monitoring and upgrades

New to parachain development? Start with the [Introduction to the Polkadot SDK](/develop/parachains/get-started/intro-polkadot-sdk/) to discover how this framework simplifies the process of building custom parachains.
