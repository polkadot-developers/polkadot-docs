# Parachains

## Benefits of Parachains

With the [Polkadot relay chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/){target=\_blank} handling security and consensus, parachain developers are free to focus on features such as asset management, governance, and cross-chain communication. The Polkadot SDK equips developers with the tools to build, deploy, and maintain efficient, scalable parachains. 

Polkadot SDK’s FRAME framework provides developers with the tools to do the following:

- Customize parachain runtimes
- Develop new pallets
- Add smart contract functionality
- Test your build for a confident deployment
- Deploy your blockchain for use
- Maintain your network inlcuding monitoring and upgrades

If you are new to the ecosystem, the [Get Started](polkadot-docs/develop/parachains/get-started) section will walk you through installing the Polkadot SDK and setting up your development environment. The remaining sections guide you through the blockchain development process from building your custom parachain to testing and deployment.
