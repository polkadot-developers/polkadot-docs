# Parachains

This section provides a complete guide to working with the Polkadot SDK, from getting started to long-term network maintenance. Discover how to create custom blockchains, test and deploy your parachains, and ensure their continued performance and reliability.

## Building Parachains with the Polkadot SDK

With the [Polkadot relay chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/){target=\_blank} handling security and consensus, parachain developers are free to focus on features such as asset management, governance, and cross-chain communication. The Polkadot SDK equips developers with the tools to build, deploy, and maintain efficient, scalable parachains.

Polkadot SDKâ€™s FRAME framework provides developers with the tools to do the following:

- Customize parachain runtimes
- Develop new pallets
- Add smart contract functionality
- Test your build for a confident deployment
- Deploy your blockchain for use
- Maintain your network including monitoring and upgrades

New to parachain development? Start with the [Introduction to the Polkadot SDK](/develop/parachains/get-started/intro-polkadot-sdk/) to discover how this framework simplifies building custom parachains.
