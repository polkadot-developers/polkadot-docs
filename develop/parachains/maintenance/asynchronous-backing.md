# Upgrade Parachain for Asynchronous Backing Compatibility

## Introduction

This guide is relevant for Cumulus-based parachain projects started in 2023 or before, whose backing process is synchronous where parablocks can only be built on the latest relay chain block. Async backing allows collators to build parablocks on older relay chain blocks and create pipelines of multiple pending parablocks. This parallel block generation increases efficiency and throughput.

!!!note
    If starting a new parachain project, please use an async backing compatible template such as 
    the [parachain template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template).
    The rollout process for async backing has three phases. Phases 1 and 2 below put new
    infrastructure in place. Then we can simply turn on async backing in phase 3.

## Prerequisite

The relay chain needs to have async backing enabled so double-check that the relay chain configuration contains the following three parameters (especially when testing locally e.g. with zombienet):

```json
"async_backing_params": {
    "max_candidate_depth": 3,
    "allowed_ancestry_len": 2
},
"scheduling_lookahead": 2
```

!!! warning 
    `scheduling_lookahead` must be set to 2, otherwise parachain block times will degrade to worse than with sync backing!

## Phase 1 - Update Parachain Runtime

This phase involves configuring your parachain's runtime `/runtime/src/lib.rs` to make use of async backing system.

1. Establish and ensure that constants for capacity (`UNINCLUDED_SEGMENT_CAPACITY`) and velocity (`BLOCK_PROCESSING_VELOCITY`) are both set to `1` in the runtime.
2. Establish and ensure the constant relay chain slot duration measured in milliseconds equal to `6000` in the runtime.

    ```rust title="lib.rs"
    // Maximum number of blocks simultaneously accepted by the runtime, not yet included into the
    // relay chain.
    pub const UNINCLUDED_SEGMENT_CAPACITY: u32 = 1;
    // How many parachain blocks are processed by the relay chain per parent. Limits the number of
    // blocks authored per slot.
    pub const BLOCK_PROCESSING_VELOCITY: u32 = 1;
    // Relay chain slot duration, in milliseconds.
    pub const RELAY_chain_SLOT_DURATION_MILLIS: u32 = 6000;
    ```

3. Establish constants `MILLISECS_PER_BLOCK` and `SLOT_DURATION` if not already present in the runtime.

    ```rust
    // `SLOT_DURATION` is picked up by `pallet_timestamp` which is in turn picked
    // up by `pallet_aura` to implement `fn slot_duration()`.
    //
    // Change this to adjust the block time.
    pub const MILLISECS_PER_BLOCK: u64 = 12000;
    pub const SLOT_DURATION: u64 = MILLISECS_PER_BLOCK;
    ```

4. Configure `cumulus_pallet_parachain_system` in the runtime.

    - Define a `FixedVelocityConsensusHook` using our capacity, velocity, and relay slot duration constants. 
    - Use this to set the parachain system [`ConsensusHook`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/cumulus_pallet_parachain_system/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.ConsensusHook){target=\_blank} property.

    ```rust
    type ConsensusHook = cumulus_pallet_aura_ext::FixedVelocityConsensusHook<
        Runtime,
        RELAY_CHAIN_SLOT_DURATION_MILLIS,
        BLOCK_PROCESSING_VELOCITY,
        UNINCLUDED_SEGMENT_CAPACITY,
    >;
    ```

    ```rust
    impl cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::Config for Runtime {
        ..
        type ConsensusHook = ConsensusHook;
        ..
    }
    ```

    Set the parachain system property `CheckAssociatedRelayNumber` to `RelayNumberMonotonicallyIncreases`

    ```rust
    impl cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::Config for Runtime {
        ..
        type CheckAssociatedRelayNumber = RelayNumberMonotonicallyIncreases;
        ..
    }
    ```

5. Configure `pallet_aura` in the runtime.

    - Set `AllowMultipleBlocksPerSlot` to `false` 
        - We will set it to `true` when we activate async backing in phase 3

    - Define `pallet_aura::SlotDuration` using our constant `SLOT_DURATION`

    ```rust
    impl pallet_aura::Config for Runtime {
        ..
        type AllowMultipleBlocksPerSlot = ConstBool<false>;
        #[cfg(feature = "experimental")]
        type SlotDuration = ConstU64<SLOT_DURATION>;
        ..
    }
    ```

6. Update `sp_consensus_aura::AuraApi::slot_duration` in `sp_api::impl_runtime_apis` to match
   the constant `SLOT_DURATION`

    ```rust
    fn impl_slot_duration() -> sp_consensus_aura::SlotDuration {
        sp_consensus_aura::SlotDuration::from_millis(SLOT_DURATION)
    }
    ```

7. Implement the `AuraUnincludedSegmentApi`, which allows the collator client to query its runtime to determine whether it should author a block.

    - Add the dependency `cumulus-primitives-aura` to the `runtime/Cargo.toml` file for your runtime

    ```rust title="Cargo.toml"
    ..
    cumulus-primitives-aura = { path = "../../../../primitives/aura", default-features = false }
    ..
    ```

    In the same file, add `"cumulus-primitives-aura/std",` to the `std` feature.

    Inside the `impl_runtime_apis!` block for your runtime, implement the
    `cumulus_primitives_aura::AuraUnincludedSegmentApi` as shown below.

    ```rust
    fn impl_can_build_upon(
        included_hash: <Block as BlockT>::Hash,
        slot: cumulus_primitives_aura::Slot,
    ) -> bool {
        ConsensusHook::can_build_upon(included_hash, slot)
    }
    ```

    !!!note
        With a capacity of 1 we have an effective velocity of Â½ even when velocity is configured to some larger value. This is because capacity will be filled after a single block is produced and will only be freed up after that block is included on the relay chain, which takes 2 relay blocks to accomplish. Thus with capacity 1 and velocity 1 we get the customary 12 second parachain block time.

8. If your `runtime/src/lib.rs` provides a `CheckInherents` type to `register_validate_block`, remove it. `FixedVelocityConsensusHook` makes it unnecessary. The following example shows how `register_validate_block` should look after removing `CheckInherents`.

    ```rust
    cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::register_validate_block! {
        Runtime = Runtime,
        BlockExecutor = cumulus_pallet_aura_ext::BlockExecutor::<Runtime, Executive>,
    }
    ```

## Phase 2 - Update Parachain Nodes

This phase consists of plugging in the new lookahead collator node.

1. Import `cumulus_primitives_core::ValidationCode` to `node/src/service.rs`.

    ```rust
    use cumulus_primitives_core::{
        relay_chain::{CollatorPair, ValidationCode},
        GetParachainInfo, ParaId,
    };
    ```

2. In `node/src/service.rs`, modify `sc_service::spawn_tasks` to use a clone of `Backend` rather than the original

    ```rust
    sc_service::spawn_tasks(sc_service::SpawnTasksParams {
        ..
        backend: backend.clone(),
        ..
    })?;
    ```

3. Add `backend` as a parameter to `start_consensus()` in `node/src/service.rs`

    ```rust
    fn start_consensus(
        ..
        backend: Arc<ParachainBackend>,
        ..
    ```

    ```rust
    if validator {
    start_consensus(
        ..
        backend.clone(),
        ..
    )?;
    }
    ```

4. In `node/src/service.rs` import the lookahead collator rather than the basic collator

    ```rust
    use cumulus_client_consensus_aura::collators::lookahead::{self as aura, Params as AuraParams};
    ```

5. In `start_consensus()` replace the `BasicAuraParams` struct with `AuraParams`

    - Change the struct type from `BasicAuraParams` to `AuraParams`
    - In the `para_client` field, pass in a cloned para client rather than the original
    - Add a `para_backend` parameter after `para_client`, passing in our para backend
    - Provide a `code_hash_provider` closure like that shown below
    - Increase `authoring_duration` from 500 milliseconds to 2000

    ```rust
    let params = AuraParams {
        ..
        para_client: client.clone(),
        para_backend: backend.clone(),
        ..
        code_hash_provider: move |block_hash| {
            client.code_at(block_hash).ok().map(|c| ValidationCode::from(c).hash())
        },
        ..
        authoring_duration: Duration::from_millis(2000),
        ..
    };
    ```

    !!!note
        Set `authoring_duration` to whatever you want, taking your own hardware into account. But if the backer, who should be slower than you due to reading from disk, times out at two seconds your candidates will be rejected.

6. In `start_consensus()` replace `basic_aura::run` with `aura::run`

    ```rust
    let fut =
    aura::run::<Block, sp_consensus_aura::sr25519::AuthorityPair, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _>(
    params,
    );
    task_manager.spawn_essential_handle().spawn("aura", None, fut);
    ```

## Phase 3 - Activate Async Backing

This phase consists of changes to your parachain's runtime that activate async backing feature.

1. Configure `pallet_aura`, setting `AllowMultipleBlocksPerSlot` to true in
   `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

    ```rust
    impl pallet_aura::Config for Runtime {
        type AuthorityId = AuraId;
        type DisabledValidators = ();
        type MaxAuthorities = ConstU32<100_000>;
        type AllowMultipleBlocksPerSlot = ConstBool<true>;
        type SlotDuration = ConstU64<SLOT_DURATION>;
    }
    ```

2. Increase the maximum `UNINCLUDED_SEGMENT_CAPACITY` in `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

    ```rust
    mod async_backing_params {
        /// Maximum number of blocks simultaneously accepted by the Runtime, not yet included
        /// into the relay chain.
        pub(crate) const UNINCLUDED_SEGMENT_CAPACITY: u32 = 3;
        /// How many parachain blocks are processed by the relay chain per parent. Limits the
        /// number of blocks authored per slot.
        pub(crate) const BLOCK_PROCESSING_VELOCITY: u32 = 1;
        /// Relay chain slot duration, in milliseconds.
        pub(crate) const RELAY_CHAIN_SLOT_DURATION_MILLIS: u32 = 6000;
    }
    ```

3. Decrease `MILLISECS_PER_BLOCK` to 6000.

    !!!note
        For a parachain which measures time in terms of its own block number rather than by relay block number it may be preferable to increase velocity. Changing block time may cause complications, requiring additional changes. See the section "Timing by Block Number".

    ```rust
    mod block_times {
        /// This determines the average expected block time that we are targeting. Blocks will be
        /// produced at a minimum duration defined by `SLOT_DURATION`. `SLOT_DURATION` is picked up by
        /// `pallet_timestamp` which is in turn picked up by `pallet_aura` to implement `fn
        /// slot_duration()`.
        ///
        /// Change this to adjust the block time.
        pub const MILLI_SECS_PER_BLOCK: u64 = 6000;

        // NOTE: Currently it is not possible to change the slot duration after the chain has started.
        // Attempting to do so will brick block production.
        pub const SLOT_DURATION: u64 = MILLI_SECS_PER_BLOCK;
    }
    ```

4. Update `MAXIMUM_BLOCK_WEIGHT` to reflect the increased time available for block production.

    ```rust
    const MAXIMUM_BLOCK_WEIGHT: Weight = Weight::from_parts(
        WEIGHT_REF_TIME_PER_SECOND.saturating_mul(2),
        cumulus_primitives_core::relay_chain::MAX_POV_SIZE as u64,
    );
    ```

5. Add a feature flagged alternative for `MinimumPeriod` in `pallet_timestamp`. The type should be `ConstU64<0>` with the feature flag experimental, and `ConstU64<{SLOT_DURATION / 2}>` without.

    ```rust
    impl pallet_timestamp::Config for Runtime {
        ..
        #[cfg(feature = "experimental")]
        type MinimumPeriod = ConstU64<0>;
        #[cfg(not(feature = "experimental"))]
        type MinimumPeriod = ConstU64<{ SLOT_DURATION / 2 }>;
        ..
    }
    ```

## Timing by Block Number

With asynchronous backing it will be possible for parachains to opt for a block time of 6 seconds rather than 12 seconds. But modifying block duration isn't so simple for a parachain which was measuring time in terms of its own block number. It could result in expected and actual time not matching up, stalling the parachain.

One strategy to deal with this issue is to instead rely on relay chain block numbers for timing. Relay block number is kept track of by each parachain in `pallet-parachain-system` with the
storage value `LastRelaychainBlockNumber`. This value can be obtained and used wherever timing based on block number is needed.
