# Maintenance

## Benefits of Maintenance

Learn how to maintain Polkadot SDK-based networks, covering runtime monitoring, upgrades, and storage migrations for optimal blockchain performance. Proper network monitoring and maintenance are essential to operating a reliable, performant change that adds value for its users. Following maintenance best practices helps keep your blockchain secure, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements. Proper maintenance is crucial for long-term success, whether operating a solo chain or a parachain.

## Get Started

These sections cover how to monitor your deployed blockchain so you can feel confident that your applications and users receive the secure, performant results they need. You will learn how runtime versioning and storage migration work together to allow forkless upgrades. These features ensure you can offer the most current functionality from the Polkadot ecosystem without compromising network uptime or security.
