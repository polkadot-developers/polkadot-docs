# Testing Your Polkadot SDK-Based Blockchain

Explore comprehensive testing strategies for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, from setting up test environments to verifying runtime and pallet interactions. Testing is essential to feeling confident your network will behave the way you intend upon deployment. 

## Get Started

These sections build upon the benchmarking and pallet testing you learned in [Customize your Parachain](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/){target=\_blank} and teach you how to test complete runtimes to ensure pallets interact correctly and integrate well with Polkadot system components. Learn how to set up a mock environment and perform comprehensive runtime testing so you can feel confident your blockchain is secure, performant, and ready for deployment. 

Through these guides, you'll learn to:

- Create effective test environments
- Validate pallet interactions
- Simulate blockchain conditions
- Verify runtime behavior
