# Testing Your Polkadot SDK-Based Blockchain

Explore comprehensive testing strategies for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, from setting up test environments to verifying runtime and pallet interactions. 

These sections build upon the benchmarking and pallet testing you learned in [Custom Blockchains](/develop/blockchains/custom-blockchains/){target=\_blank} and teach you how to test complete runtimes to ensure pallets interact correctly and integrate well with Polkadot system components. Learn how to set up a mock environment and perform comprehensive runtime testing so you can feel confident your blockchain is secure, performant, and ready for deployment.
