# Block Explorers

## Introduction

Block explorers serve as comprehensive blockchain analytics platforms that provide access to on-chain data. These web applications function as search engines for blockchain networks, allowing users to query, visualize, and analyze blockchain data in real-time through intuitive interfaces.

## Core Functionality

These block explorers provide essential capabilities for interacting with smart contracts in Polkadot Hub:

- **Transaction Tracking** - monitor transaction status, confirmations, fees, and metadata
- **Address analysis** - view account balances, transaction history, and associated contracts
- **Block information** - examine block contents
- **Smart contract interaction** - review contract code, verification status, and interaction history
- **Token tracking** - monitor ERC-20/ERC-721/other token standards with transfer history and holder analytics
- **Network statistics** - access metrics on transaction volume, gas usage, and other network parameters
