# Block Explorers

## Introduction

Block explorers serve as comprehensive blockchain analytics platforms that provide access to on-chain data. These web applications function as search engines for blockchain networks, allowing users to query, visualize, and analyze blockchain data in real time through intuitive interfaces.

## Core Functionality

These block explorers provide essential capabilities for interacting with smart contracts in Polkadot Hub:

- **Transaction tracking** - monitor transaction status, confirmations, fees, and metadata
- **Address analysis** - view account balances, transaction history, and associated contracts
- **Block information** - examine block contents
- **Smart contract interaction** - review contract code, verification status, and interaction history
- **Token tracking** - monitor ERC-20, ERC-721, and other token standards with transfer history and holder analytics
- **Network statistics** - access metrics on transaction volume, gas usage, and other network parameters

## Available Block Explorers

The following block explorers are available for PolkaVM smart contracts, providing specialized tools for monitoring and analyzing contract activity within the Polkadot ecosystem:

### Subscan

Subscan is the flagship Polkadot ecosystem block explorer with comprehensive support for PolkaVM smart contracts. It provides robust transaction indexing, account analysis, and monitoring tools specifically optimized for Polkadot SDK-based networks.
