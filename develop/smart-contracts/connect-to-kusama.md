For more information about how to connect to a Polkadot network, please check the [Wallets](/develop/smart-contracts/wallets/){target=\_blank} guide.

!!! info "Production Environment"
    Kusama Hub offers a live environment for deploying smart contracts. Please note that the most recent version of Polkadot's Ethereum-compatible stack is available on the TestNet; however, you can also deploy it to the Kusama Hub for production use.


## Networks Details

Developers can leverage smart contracts on Kusama Hub for live production deployments. This section outlines the network specifications and connection details.

## Important Deployment Considerations

While the compatibility with regular EVM codebases is still being maximized, some recommendations include:
    
- **Leverage [Hardhat](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/hardhat){target=\_blank}** to compile, deploy, and interact with your contract.
- **Use MetaMask** to interact with your dApp (note that using MetaMask can sometimes lead to `Invalid transaction` errors - this is actively being worked on and will be fixed soon).
- **Avoid Remix** for deployment as MetaMask enforces a 48kb size limit when using the [Remix IDE](/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix){target=\_blank}, which is why Hardhat Polkadot is recommended for deployment.

Kusama Hub is a live environment. Ensure your contracts are thoroughly tested before deployment, as transactions on Kusama Hub involve real KSM tokens and **cannot be reversed**.
