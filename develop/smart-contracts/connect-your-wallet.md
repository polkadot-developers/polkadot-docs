# Connect Your Wallet

## Connect to Asset Hub Using MetaMask

MetaMask is a popular wallet for interacting with EVM-compatible chains. It allows users to connect to test networks that support Ethereum-based smart contracts. This article guides setting up MetaMask, connecting to the contracts deployed on the EVM-compatible test network, the Westend Asset Hub, and requesting test tokens for development purposes.

It's important to emphasize that MetaMask primarily facilitates interactions with smart contracts, giving you access to various chain functionalities.

## Prerequisites

To get started with MetaMask, you need to install the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/download/){target=\_blank} and add it to the browser. Once you install MetaMask, you can set up a new wallet and securely store your seed phrase. This phrase is crucial for recovery in case you lose access.
