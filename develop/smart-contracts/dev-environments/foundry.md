# Foundry

!!! warning
    Consider that features like Anvil (Foundry's local blockchain) and `forge test` (for running Solidity tests) are not yet supported in `foundry-polkadot`.

## Overview

Foundry is a fast, modular, and extensible toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It provides a suite of command-line tools, including `forge` for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts and `cast` for interacting with blockchains.

[`foundry-polkadot`](https://github.com/paritytech/foundry-polkadot/){target=\_blank} is an adaptation explicitly engineered for the Polkadot Hub, tailored for developers already familiar with Foundry who seek to leverage its capabilities within the Polkadot ecosystem. Additionally, this guide offers detailed information on the `forge` and `cast` commands supported within `foundry-polkadot`, complete with simple, runnable examples for quick reference.

## Installation

The installation process is tailored for the Polkadot variant:

- `foundry-polkadot` is installed via `foundryup-polkadot`, its dedicated installer. To get started, open your terminal and execute:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/foundry-polkadot/refs/heads/master/foundryup/install | bash
    ```

    This command starts the installation of `foundryup-polkadot`. After installation, run the following command to download the precompiled `foundry-polkadot` binaries:

    ```bash
    foundryup-polkadot
    ```

    This command will install the `forge` and `cast` binaries, which are explained below. Windows users must use a Unix-like terminal environment such as Git BASH or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as PowerShell and Command Prompt are not currently supported by `foundryup`.

## Compiler Integration

A core divergence lies in the underlying Solidity compiler.

- **`foundry`** is built to interface with the `solc` compiler, which targets Ethereum's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **`foundry-polkadot`**, in contrast, introduces and primarily utilizes the `resolc` compiler to compile down Solidity contracts into PolkaVM bytecode. 
    - **Command-Line Flag**: For commands that involve compilation (e.g., `forge build`), you can use the `--resolc` flag to enable `resolc` compilation. For example:

        ```bash
        forge build --resolc
        ```

        This command instructs Forge to use `resolc` instead of `solc`, generating bytecode compatible with PolkaVM.

    - **Configuration File**: Alternatively, you can configure `resolc` usage in the `foundry.toml` file by adding:

        ```toml
        [profile.default.resolc]
        resolc_compile = true
        ```

        Setting `resolc_compile = false` reverts to using `solc`, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum projects. By default, `foundry-polkadot` uses `solc` unless `resolc` is explicitly enabled. `resolc` also exposes specific options for fine-tuning the compilation process, such as `--use-resolc <RESOLC_VERSION>` for specifying a compiler version or path, `-O, --resolc-optimizer-mode <LEVEL>` for setting optimization levels, and `--heap-size <SIZE>` and `--stack-size <SIZE>` for configuring contract memory.


## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

`foundry-polkadot` preserves the familiar `forge` and `cast` subcommand structure. However, it's crucial to note that commands which involve compilation (such as `create`, `bind`, `build`, and `inspect`) will yield different output when `resolc` is utilized, as the generated bytecode is specifically designed for PolkaVM rather than the EVM.

## Unsupported or Modified Features

Not all functionalities from the original Foundry are present or behave identically in `foundry-polkadot`:

- **Currently Unsupported**:
    - Compilation of Yul code is not yet supported.
    - Support for factory contracts deployment is a known issue that is currently unresolved.
- **Broader Feature Limitations**: Integration with `Anvil` and `Chisel` (Foundry's local blockchain and EVM toolkit, respectively) is not available. This limitation directly impacts the support for several key commands, including `forge test` for running tests, `forge snapshot` for creating blockchain state snapshots, and `forge script` for complex deployment and interaction scripts.
- **Modified Feature**: The most notable modification is in the **compilation output**. When ``resolc`` is employed, the resulting bytecode will fundamentally differ from that generated by ``solc``, reflecting PolkaVM's distinct architectural requirements.

## Set up a Project

Initialize a new project using `forge init`:

```bash
forge init my-polkadot-project
cd my-polkadot-project
```

This command creates a complete project structure with the following components:

- **`src/`** - Contains the Solidity smart contracts (includes a sample `Counter.sol` contract by default)
- **`lib/`** - Houses external dependencies and libraries (`forge-std` testing library is included)
- **`script/`** - Stores deployment and interaction scripts (includes `Counter.s.sol` deployment script by default)
- **`test/`** - Contains your contract tests (includes `Counter.t.sol` test file by default)
- **`foundry.toml`** - Main configuration file for compiler settings, network configurations, and project preferences

The default project includes a simple `Counter` contract that demonstrates basic state management through increment and decrement functions, along with corresponding tests and deployment scripts to help you get started quickly.

## Compile a Project

Compile contracts using `forge build`:

```bash
forge build --resolc
```

!!!note 
    You can still use `forge build` for compiling to regular EVM bytecode.

PolkaVM bytecode starts with `0x505` prefix. Inspect compiled artifacts with:

```bash
forge inspect Counter bytecode --resolc
```

If successful, you will see the following output:

--8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-compilation.html'

## Deploy a Contract

Deploy contracts using `forge create`:

```bash
forge create Counter \
    --rpc-url <INSERT_RPC_URL> \
    --private-key <INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY> \
    --resolc
```

If the operation completes successfully, you'll see the following output (for example, to deploy to the Passet Hub chain):

--8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-deployment.html'

For contracts with constructor arguments:

```bash
forge create MyToken \
    --rpc-url <INSERT_RPC_URL> \
    --private-key <INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY> \
    --constructor-args "MyToken" "MTK" 1000000 \
    --resolc
```

!!! note "Network Compatibility"
    Use the `--resolc` flag when deploying to PolkaVM-compatible networks. Omit it for Ethereum-compatible networks.
