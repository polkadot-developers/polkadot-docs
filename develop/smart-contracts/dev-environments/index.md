# Dev Environments

Explore the tools and frameworks available for building and testing smart contracts on the Polkadot network. These environments streamline the development process, from writing and compiling to testing and deploying smart contracts. The guides in this section will help you evaluate each tool's strengths, making it easier to choose the best fit for your project based on complexity, team expertise, and specific requirements.

## What to Consider

Consider the following when evaluating development environments for your workflow:

| Feature                  | Remix                                     | Hardhat                                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type                     | Web-based IDE                             | Local development environment                          |
| Installation             | No installation required (browser-based)  | Requires installation via a package manager            |
| Best for                 | Beginners, quick prototyping, and testing | Advanced development, scripting, and automation        |
| Compilation & Deployment | Built-in compiler and UI for deployment   | Uses scripts for compilation and deployment            |
| Testing & Debugging      | Basic built-in tools                      | Advanced testing with Mocha, Chai, and mainnet forking |
| Extensibility            | Limited plugin support                    | Highly customizable with plugins and scripts           |
