## What to Consider

Consider the following when evaluating development environments for your workflow:

| Development Environment | Web-Based           | Installation Required     | Best For                                    | Compilation & Deployment | Testing & Debugging          | Extensibility          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Remix**               | :octicons-check-24: | No                        | Beginners, quick prototyping                | Built-in UI & compiler   | Basic tools                  | Limited plugin support |
| **Hardhat**             | :octicons-x-24:     | Yes (via package manager) | Advanced development, scripting, automation | Script-based             | Mocha, Chai, mainnet forking | Highly customizable    |
