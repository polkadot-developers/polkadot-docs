# Web3.js

## Introduction

Interacting with blockchains typically requires an interface between your application and the network itself. [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/){target=\_blank} offers this interface through a comprehensive collection of libraries, facilitating seamless interaction with the nodes using HTTP or WebSocket protocols. This guide illustrates how to utilize Web3.js specifically for interactions with the Asset Hub chain.

## Set Up the Project

To start working with Web3.js, begin by initializing your project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## Install Dependencies

Next, install the Web3.js library:

```bash
npm install web3
```

## Set Up the Web3 Provider

The foundation of any Web3.js application is the provider configuration. This establishes your connection to the Asset Hub network:

```javascript title="connectToProvider.js"
--8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/libraries/web3-js/connectToProvider.js'
```

!!! note
    Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_CHAIN_ID`, and `INSERT_CHAIN_NAME` with the appropriate values. For example, For Westend Asset Hub testnet, use these specific connection parameters:

    ```js
    const PROVIDER_RPC = {
        rpc: 'https://westend-asset-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
        chainId: 420420421,
        name: 'westend-asset-hub'
    };
    ```

With the Web3 provider set up, you can start querying the blockchain.

For instance, to fetch the latest block number of the chain, you can use the following code snippet:

???- "fetchLastBlock.js"

    ```javascript title="fetchLastBlock.js"
    --8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/libraries/web3-js/fetchLastBlock.js'
    ```

## Compile Contracts

Asset Hub requires contracts to be compiled to [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contracts-basics/polkavm-design){target=\_blank} bytecode. This is achieved using the [`revive`](https://github.com/paritytech/revive){target=\_blank} compiler. Install the [`@parity/revive`](https://github.com/paritytech/js-revive){target=\_blank} library as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @parity/revive
```

Hereâ€™s a simple storage contract that you can use to follow the process:

```solidity title="Storage.sol"
--8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/libraries/web3-js/Storage.sol'
```

With that, you can now create a `compile.js` snippet that transform your solidity code into PolkaVM bytecode:

```javascript title="compile.js"
--8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/libraries/web3-js/compile.js'
```

After compilation, you'll have two key files: an ABI (`.json`) file, which provides a JSON interface describing the contract's functions and how to interact with it, and a bytecode (`.polkavm`) file, which contains the low-level machine code executable on PolkaVM that represents the compiled smart contract ready for blockchain deployment.

## Contract Deployment

To deploy your compiled contract to Asset Hub using Web3.js, you'll need an account with a private key to sign the deployment transaction. The deployment process is exactly the same as for any EVM-compatible chain, involving creating a contract instance, estimating gas, and sending a deployment transaction. Here's how to deploy the contract:

```javascript title="deploy.js"
--8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/libraries/web3-js/deploy.js'
```

Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INSERT_CONTRACT_NAME` with the appropriate values.

## Interact with the Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with your contract using Web3.js methods. Here's how to set a number and read it back:

```javascript title="updateStorage.js"
--8<-- 'code/develop/smart-contracts/evm-toolkit/libraries/web3-js/updateStorage.js'
```

Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the appropriate values.

## Conclusion

This guide demonstrates how to use Web3.js to interact with the Asset Hub chain, from setting up a provider to deploying and interacting with smart contracts. By leveraging tools like `@parity/revive` for PolkaVM bytecode compilation and Web3.js for blockchain interaction, developers can seamlessly build and manage dApps within the Asset Hub ecosystem.
