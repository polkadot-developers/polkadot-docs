# EVM

The Polkadot ecosystem supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts through both native EVM contracts and EVM-compatible parachains. Native EVM contracts are designed to run on Polkadot’s own Ethereum-compatible virtual machine, PolkaVM, which natively supports Ethereum's EVM. This allows Polkadot to execute Solidity-based contracts directly within its ecosystem, without relying on external Ethereum networks or EVM-compatible parachains.

With EVM support, developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) using familiar tools, languages like Solidity, and established smart contract standards, all while taking advantage of Polkadot's unique features, such as scalability and cross-chain interoperability.

Whether you're deploying existing Ethereum contracts on Polkadot or creating new applications, this section provides the resources you need to get started. Learn how to leverage popular EVM tools, such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank} and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/){target=\_blank}, to integrate Ethereum-compatible smart contract functionality into the Polkadot ecosystem.
