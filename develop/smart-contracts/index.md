# Smart Contracts

--8<-- 'text/smart-contracts/polkaVM-warning.md'

Polkadot allows scalable execution of smart contracts, offering cross-chain compatibility and lower fees than legacy L1 platforms. Polkadot provides developers with flexibility in building smart contracts, supporting both Solidity contracts executed by the [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design#polkavm){target=\_blank} (a Polkadot-native virtual machine for programming languages that can be compiled down to RISC-V) and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), as well as Wasm-based contracts using ink! (written in Rust).

This section provides tools, resources, and guides for building and deploying smart contracts on parachains. [Parachains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/parachains/overview/){target=\_blank} are specialized blockchains connected to the relay chain, benefiting from shared security and interoperability. Depending on your language and environment preference, you can develop contracts using Wasm/ink! or EVM-based solutions.
