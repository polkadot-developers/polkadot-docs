# Libraries

Explore the key libraries for interacting with smart contracts on Polkadot-based networks. These libraries simplify contract calls, event listening, and transaction handling.

This section provides setup instructions, usage examples, and a comparison to help you select the right tool for your project.

## Library Comparison

Consider the following when choosing a library for your project:

| Feature          | Ethers.js                   | Web3.js                                | viem                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Language Support | JavaScript, TypeScript      | JavaScript, TypeScript                 | TypeScript only                              |
| Type Safety      | Limited                     | Limited                                | Strong TypeScript support                    |
| Performance      | Efficient, widely optimized | Older codebase, can be less performant | Lightweight, optimized for bundling          |
| Best For         | General dApp development    | Legacy projects, Web3.js users         | TypeScript-heavy projects, modular workflows |

!!! warning
    Web3.js has been [sunset](https://blog.chainsafe.io/web3-js-sunset/){target=\_blank}. You can find guides on using [Ethers.js](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/ethers-js){target=\_blank} and [viem](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/viem){target=\_blank} in the [Libraries](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/){target=\_blank} section.
