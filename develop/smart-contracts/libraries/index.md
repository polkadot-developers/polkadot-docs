# Libraries

Leverage popular libraries to interact with smart contracts on Polkadot-based networks. These libraries simplify contract calls, event listening, and transaction handling. The guides in this section provide an overview of each library, including setup instructions, usage examples, and best practices.

## Selection Guide

Consider the following when choosing a library for your project:

- **Development experience** – some libraries offer more intuitive APIs for specific programming backgrounds
- **Project requirements** – evaluate performance needs, bundle size, and specific feature support
- **Community support** – larger communities often mean better documentation and more examples
