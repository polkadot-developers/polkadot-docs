# Libraries

Explore the key libraries for interacting with smart contracts on Polkadot-based networks. These libraries simplify contract calls, event listening, and transaction handling. This section provides setup instructions, usage examples, and a comparison to help you select the right tool for your project.

## Library Comparison

Consider the following when choosing a library for your project:

| Feature          | Ethers.js                   | Web3.js                                | viem                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Language Support | JavaScript, TypeScript      | JavaScript, TypeScript                 | TypeScript only                              |
| Type Safety      | Limited                     | Limited                                | Strong TypeScript support                    |
| Performance      | Efficient, widely optimized | Older codebase, can be less performant | Lightweight, optimized for bundling          |
| Best For         | General dApp development    | Legacy projects, Web3.js users         | TypeScript-heavy projects, modular workflows |
