# Web3.py

## Introduction

Interacting with blockchains typically requires an interface between your application and the network. [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html){target=\_blank} offers this interface through a collection of libraries, facilitating seamless interaction with the nodes using HTTP or WebSocket protocols. 

This guide illustrates how to utilize Web3.py for interactions with Polkadot Hub.

## Set Up the Project

1. To start working with Web3.py, begin by initializing your project:
```
mkdir web3py-project
cd web3py-project
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment for your project:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Next, install the Web3.py library:
```
pip install web3
```

## Set Up the Web3 Provider

The [provider](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html){target=\_blank} configuration is the foundation of any Web3.py application. The following example establishes a connection to Polkadot Hub. Follow these steps to use the provider configuration:

1. Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL` with the appropriate value. For instance, to connect to Polkadot Hub TestNet, use the following parameter:
```python
PROVIDER_RPC = 'https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io'
```

    The provider connection script should look something like this:

    ```python title="connect_to_provider.py"
    --8<-- "code/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/connect_to_provider.py"
    ```

1. With the Web3 provider set up, start querying the blockchain. For instance, you can use the following code snippet to fetch the latest block number of the chain:
```python title="fetch_last_block.py"
--8<-- "code/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/fetch_last_block.py:9:18"
```

??? code "View complete script"

    ```python title="fetch_last_block.py"
    --8<-- "code/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/fetch_last_block.py"
    ```

## Contract Deployment

Before deploying your contracts, make sure you've compiled them and obtained two key files:

- An ABI (.json) file, which provides a JSON interface describing the contract's functions and how to interact with it
- A bytecode (.polkavm) file, which contains the low-level machine code executable on [PolkaVM](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/polkavm-design#polkavm){target=\_blank} that represents the compiled smart contract ready for blockchain deployment

To follow this guide, you can use the following solidity contract as an example:

```solidity title="Storage.sol"
--8<-- "code/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/Storage.sol"
```

To deploy your compiled contract to Polkadot Hub using Web3.py, you'll need an account with a private key to sign the deployment transaction. The deployment process is exactly the same as for any Ethereum-compatible chain, involving creating a contract instance, estimating gas, and sending a deployment transaction. Here's how to deploy the contract. Replace `INSERT_RPC_URL` and `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY` with the appropriate values:

```python title="deploy.py"
--8<-- "code/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/deploy.py"
```

!!!warning
    Never commit or share your private key. Exposed keys can lead to immediate theft of all associated funds. Use environment variables instead.

## Interact with the Contract

After deployment, interact with your contract using Web3.py methods. The example below demonstrates how to set and retrieve a number. Be sure to replace the `INSERT_RPC_URL`, `INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` placeholders with your specific values:

```python title="update_storage.py"
--8<-- "code/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/update_storage.py"
```
