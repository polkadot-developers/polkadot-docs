## Interact with the XCM Precompile

To interact with the XCM precompile using Remix IDE:

1. **Copy the IXcm Interface**: Grab the IXcm interface definition (provided above) and paste it into a new Solidity file named `IXcm.sol` in Remix.
2. **Set the Precompile Address**: In Remix, go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" plugin, and in the "At Address" field, enter the precompile address: `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a0000`.
3. **Interact with the Precompile**: Click the "At Address" button. Remix will now allow you to interact directly with the XCM precompile contract using the functions defined in the IXcm interface.

You can now call the `execute`, `send`, and `weighMessage` functions on the XCM precompile from Remix, using properly encoded parameters as described in this guide.
