# Wallets for Polkadot Hub

--8<-- 'text/smart-contracts/polkaVM-warning.md'

## Introduction

Connecting a compatible wallet is the first essential step for interacting with the Polkadot Hub ecosystem. This guide explores wallet options that support both Substrate and Ethereum compatible layers, enabling transactions and smart contract interactions. Whether you're a developer testing on Polkadot Hub or a user accessing the MainNet, understanding wallet configuration is crucial for accessing the full range of Polkadot Hub's capabilities.

## Connect Your Wallet

### MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank} is a popular wallet for interacting with Ethereum-compatible chains. It allows users to connect to test networks that support Ethereum-based smart contracts. However, it's important to emphasize that MetaMask primarily facilitates interactions with smart contracts, giving users access to various chain functionalities. 

To get started with MetaMask, you need to install the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/download/){target=\_blank} and add it to the browser. Once you install MetaMask, you can set up a new wallet and securely store your seed phrase. This phrase is crucial for recovery in case you lose access.

For example, to connect to the Polkadot Hub TestNet via MetaMask, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open the MetaMask extension and click on the network icon to switch to the Polkadot Hub TestNet.

The steps in the preceding section can be used to connect to any chain by modifying the network specification and endpoint parameters.

### SubWallet

[SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/){target=\_blank} is a popular non-custodial wallet solution for Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems. It offers seamless integration with Polkadot SDK-based networks while maintaining Ethereum compatibility, making the wallet an ideal choice for users and developers to interact with Polkadot Hub.

SubWallet now fully supports the [Polkadot Hub TestNet](/polkadot-protocol/smart-contract-basics/networks/#test-networks){target=\_blank} where developers can deploy and interact with Ethereum-compatible, Solidity smart contracts.

You can easily view and manage your Paseo native token (PAS) using the Ethereum RPC endpoint (Passet Hub EVM) or the Substrate node RPC endpoint (passet-hub).

??? code "Polkadot Hub TestNet"
    You can see support here for Polkadot Hub's TestNet. The **Passet Hub EVM** network uses an ETH RPC endpoint, and the **passet-hub** uses a Substrate endpoint.
    The ETH RPC endpoint will let you send transactions that follow an ETH format, while the Substrate endpoint will follow a Substrate transaction format.
    Note the PAS token, which is the native token of the Polkadot Hub TestNet.
