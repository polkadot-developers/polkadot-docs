# Polkadot-API

## Introduction

[Polkadot-API](https://papi.how/){target=\_blank}(PAPI) is a set of libraries, built to be modular, composable, and grounded in a “light-client first” approach. Its primary aim is to equip dApp developers with an extensive toolkit essential for building fully decentralized applications.

PAPI is optimized for light-client functionality, using the new JSON-RPC spec to fully support decentralized interactions. It provides strong TypeScript support with types and documentation generated directly from on-chain metadata, and it offers seamless access to storage reads, constants, transactions, events, and runtime calls. Developers can connect to multiple chains simultaneously and prepare for runtime updates through multi-descriptor generation and compatibility checks. Polkadot-API is lightweight and performant, leveraging native BigInt, dynamic imports, and modular subpaths to avoid bundling unnecessary assets. It supports both promise-based and observable-based APIs, integrates easily with Polkadot-JS extensions, and offers signing options through browser extensions or private keys.
