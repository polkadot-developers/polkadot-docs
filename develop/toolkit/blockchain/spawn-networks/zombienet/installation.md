## Install Zombienet

Zombienet releases are available on the [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=_blank}.

To install Zombienet, there are multiple options available, depending on the user's preferences and the environment where it will be used. The following section will guide you through the installation process for each of the available options.

=== "Using the Executable"

    Zombienet executables can be downloaded using the latest release uploaded on the [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases){target=_blank}. You can download the executable for your operating system and architecture and then move it to a directory in your PATH. Each release includes executables for Linux and macOS, which are generated using [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg){target=_blank}. This allows the Zombienet CLI to operate without requiring Node.js to be installed. 

    Alternatively, you can also download the executable using either `curl` or `wget`:

    === "curl"

        ```bash
        curl -LO \
        https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_EXECUTABLE
        ```

    === "wget"

        ```bash
        wget \
        https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_EXECUTABLE
        ```

    !!! note
        - Replace `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION` with the URL that you want to download
        - Replace `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_EXECUTABLE` with the name of the executable file that matches your operating system and architecture 
        - This guide uses `v{{ dependencies.zombienet.version }}` and `zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }}`

    Then, ensure the downloaded file is executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }}
    ```

    Finally, you can run the following command to check if the installation was successful. If so, it will display the version of the installed Zombienet:

    ```bash
    ./zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }} version
    ```

    If you want to add the `zombienet` executable to your PATH, you can move it to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

    ```bash
    mv zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }} /usr/local/bin/zombienet
    ```

    So then, you can refer to the `zombienet` executable directly:

    ```bash
    zombienet version
    ```

=== "Using Nix"

    For Nix users, the Zombienet repository provides a [`flake.nix`](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/blob/main/flake.nix){target=\_blank} file that can be used to install Zombienet. This means that users can easily incorporate Zombienet into their Nix-based projects. 
    
    To install Zombienet utilizing Nix, users can run the following command, triggering the fetching of the flake and subsequently installing the Zombienet package:

    ```bash
    nix run github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION -- \
    spawn INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME.toml
    ```

    !!! note
        - Replace the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION` with the desired version of Zombienet
        - Replace the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME` with the name of the configuration file you want to use

    To run the command above, you need to have [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes){target=_blank} enabled.

    Alternatively, you can also include the Zombienet binary in the PATH for the current shell. This can be achieved by:
    
    ```bash
    nix shell github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION
    ```

=== "Using Docker"

    Zombienet can also be run using Docker. The Zombienet repository provides a Docker image that can be used to run the Zombienet CLI. To run Zombienet using Docker, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files \
    paritytech/zombienet
    ```
    The command above will run the Zombienet CLI inside a Docker container and mount the current directory to the `/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files` directory inside the container. This allows Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

    Inside the Docker container, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. First, you need to set up Zombienet downloading the necessary binaries:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    After that, you need to add those binaries to the PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/home/nonroot/zombie-net:$PATH
    ```

    Finally, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. For example, to spawn a network using a specific configuration file, you can run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- -p native spawn host-current-files/minimal.toml
    ```

    The command above mounts the current directory to the `/workspace` directory inside the Docker container. This allows Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

## Providers

Zombienet supports different backend providers for running the nodes. At this moment, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){target=_blank}, [Podman](https://podman.io/){target=_blank}, and local providers are supported, which can be declared as `kubernetes`, `podman`, or `native`, respectively.

To use a particular provider, you can specify it in the network file or use the `--provider` flag in the CLI:

```bash
zombienet spawn network.toml --provider INSERT_PROVIDER
```

Alternatively, you can set the provider in the network file:

```toml
[settings]
provider = "INSERT_PROVIDER"
...
```

It's important to note that each provider has specific requirements and associated features. The subsequent sections will guide you through the installation process for each provider and the requirements and features each provider offers.

### Kubernetes

=== "Requirements"
    Zombienet is designed to be compatible with a variety of Kubernetes clusters including: 

    - [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine){target=_blank}
    - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/){target=_blank}
    - [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/){target=_blank}

    To effectively interact with your cluster, you'll need to ensure that [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/){target=_blank} is installed on your system, which is the Kubernetes command-line tool that allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. If you don't have `kubectl` installed, you can follow the instructions provided on the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl){target=_blank}.

    To create resources such as namespaces, pods, and CronJobs within the target cluster, you must have the appropriate permissions granted to your user or service account. These permissions are essential for managing and deploying applications effectively within Kubernetes.

=== "Features"
    In Kubernetes, Zombienet uses the Prometheus operator (if available) to oversee monitoring and visibility. This configuration ensures that only essential networking-related pods are deployed. Using the Prometheus operator, Zombienet improves its ability to efficiently monitor and manage network activities within the Kubernetes cluster. 

### Podman

=== "Requirements"
    Zombienet supports Podman rootless as a provider. To use Podman as a provider, you need to have Podman installed on your system. Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and container images on Linux-based systems. You can install Podman by following the instructions provided on the [Podman website](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation){target=_blank}.

=== "Features"
    Using Podman, Zombienet deploys additional pods to enhance the monitoring and visibility of the active network. Specifically, pods for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=_blank}, [Tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/operations/monitor/){target=_blank}, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/){target=_blank} are included in the deployment. Grafana is configured with Prometheus and Tempo as data sources.

    Upon launching Zombienet, access to these monitoring services is facilitated through specific URLs provided in the output:

    - Prometheus - [http://127.0.0.1:34123](http://127.0.0.1:34123){target=_blank}
    - Tempo - [http://127.0.0.1:34125](http://127.0.0.1:34125){target=_blank}
    - Grafana - [http://127.0.0.1:41461](http://127.0.0.1:41461){target=_blank}

    It's important to note that Grafana is deployed with default administrator access. 
    
    When network operations cease, either by halting a running spawn with `Ctrl+C` or upon completion of the test, Zombienet automatically removes all associated pods.

!!! warning
    Currently, Podman can only be used with Zombienet on Linux machines. Although Podman has support for macOS through an internal VM, the Zombienet provider code requires Podman to run natively on Linux.

### Local Provider

=== "Requirements"
    The Zombienet local provider, also referred to as native, enables you to run nodes as local processes in your environment. You must have the necessary binaries for your network (such as `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain`). These binaries should be available in your PATH, allowing Zombienet to spawn the nodes as local processes.

    To install the necessary binaries, you can use the Zombienet CLI command:

    ```bash
    zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    This command will download and prepare the necessary binaries for Zombienetâ€™s use.

    !!! warning
        The `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain` binaries releases aren't compatible with macOS. As a result, macOS users will need to clone the [Polkadot repository](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=_blank}, build the Polkadot binary, and manually add it to their PATH for `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain` to work.

If you need to use a custom binary, ensure the binary is available in your PATH. You can also specify the binary path in the network configuration file. To showcase this, this guide will use the custom [OpenZeppelin template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates){target=_blank} as an example.

First, clone the OpenZeppelin template repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates \
&& cd polkadot-runtime-templates/generic-template
```

Then, build the custom binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

After that, add the custom binary to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/polkadot-runtime-templates/parachain-template-node/targetrelease
```

Alternatively, you can specify the binary path in the network configuration file:

```toml
[relaychain]
chain = "rococo-local"
default_command = "./bin-v1.6.0/polkadot"

[parachain]
id = 1000

    [parachain.collators]
    name = "collator01"
    command = "./target/release/parachain-template-node"
```

!!! note
    The local provider exclusively utilizes the command configuration for nodescollators, which supports both relative and absolute paths. You can employ the`default_command` configuration to specify the binary for spawning all nodes inthe relay chain.
