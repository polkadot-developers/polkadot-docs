# Spawn Chains for Testing with Zombienet

## Introduction

Zombienet is a versatile testing framework tailored for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. This guide consolidates essential tasks for deploying and testing ephemeral blockchain environments across various platforms, including Kubernetes, Podman, and native setups. With its simple CLI, developers can spawn relay chains, parachains, and run comprehensive tests to validate network performance. 

From installation to advanced testing scenarios, youâ€™ll explore how Zombienet leverages metrics, logs, and custom scripts to ensure robust blockchain development. Whether you're new to blockchain testing or refining your setup, this guide offers the tools and insights needed for efficient testing.

??? interface "Additional support resources"
    [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/){target=_blank} has designed and developed this framework, now maintained by the Zombienet team. 

    For further support and information, refer to the following contact points:

    - [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=_blank}
    - [Element public channel](https://matrix.to/#/!FWyuEyNvIFygLnWNMh:parity.io?via=parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=web3.foundation){target=_blank}

## Install Zombienet

Zombienet releases are available on the [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=_blank}.

To install Zombienet, there are multiple options available, depending on the user's preferences and the environment where it will be used. The following section will guide you through the installation process for each of the available options.

=== "Using the Executable"

    Zombienet executables can be downloaded using the latest release uploaded on the [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases){target=_blank}. You can download the executable for your operating system and architecture and then move it to a directory in your PATH. Each release includes executables for Linux and macOS, which are generated using [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg){target=_blank}. This allows the Zombienet CLI to operate without requiring Node.js to be installed. 

    Alternatively, you can also download the executable using either `curl` or `wget`:

    === "curl"

        ```bash
        curl -LO \
        https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_EXECUTABLE
        ```

    === "wget"

        ```bash
        wget \
        https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_EXECUTABLE
        ```

    !!! note
        - Replace `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION` with the URL that you want to download
        - Replace `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_EXECUTABLE` with the name of the executable file that matches your operating system and architecture 
        - This guide uses `v{{ dependencies.zombienet.version }}` and `zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }}`

    Then, ensure the downloaded file is executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }}
    ```

    Finally, you can run the following command to check if the installation was successful. If so, it will display the version of the installed Zombienet:

    ```bash
    ./zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }} version
    ```

    If you want to add the `zombienet` executable to your PATH, you can move it to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

    ```bash
    mv zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }} /usr/local/bin/zombienet
    ```

    So then, you can refer to the `zombienet` executable directly:

    ```bash
    zombienet version
    ```

    So then, you can refer to the `zombienet` executable directly:

    ```bash
    zombienet version
    ```

=== "Using Nix"

    For Nix users, the Zombienet repository provides a [`flake.nix`](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/blob/main/flake.nix){target=\_blank} file that can be used to install Zombienet. This means that users can easily incorporate Zombienet into their Nix-based projects. 
    
    To install Zombienet utilizing Nix, users can run the following command, triggering the fetching of the flake and subsequently installing the Zombienet package:

    ```bash
    nix run github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION -- \
    spawn INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME.toml
    ```

    !!! note
        - Replace the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION` with the desired version of Zombienet
        - Replace the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME` with the name of the configuration file you want to use

    To run the command above, you need to have [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes){target=_blank} enabled.

    Alternatively, you can also include the Zombienet binary in the PATH for the current shell. This can be achieved by:
    
    ```bash
    nix shell github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION
    ```

=== "Using Docker"

    Zombienet can also be run using Docker. The Zombienet repository provides a Docker image that can be used to run the Zombienet CLI. To run Zombienet using Docker, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files \
    paritytech/zombienet
    ```
    The command above will run the Zombienet CLI inside a Docker container and mount the current directory to the `/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files` directory inside the container. This allows Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

    Inside the Docker container, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. First, you need to set up Zombienet downloading the necessary binaries:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    After that, you need to add those binaries to the PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/home/nonroot/zombie-net:$PATH
    ```

    Finally, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. For example, to spawn a network using a specific configuration file, you can run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- -p native spawn host-current-files/minimal.toml
    ```

    The command above mounts the current directory to the `/workspace` directory inside the Docker container. This allows Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

## Providers

Zombienet supports different backend providers for running the nodes. At this moment, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){target=_blank}, [Podman](https://podman.io/){target=_blank}, and local providers are supported, which can be declared as `kubernetes`, `podman`, or `native`, respectively.

To use a particular provider, you can specify it in the network file or use the `--provider` flag in the CLI:

```bash
zombienet spawn network.toml --provider INSERT_PROVIDER
```

Alternatively, you can set the provider in the network file:

```toml
[settings]
provider = "INSERT_PROVIDER"
...
```

It's important to note that each provider has specific requirements and associated features. The subsequent sections will guide you through the installation process for each provider and the requirements and features each provider offers.

### Kubernetes

=== "Requirements"
    Zombienet is designed to be compatible with a variety of Kubernetes clusters including: 

    - [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine){target=_blank}
    - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/){target=_blank}
    - [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/){target=_blank}

    To effectively interact with your cluster, you'll need to ensure that [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/){target=_blank} is installed on your system, which is the Kubernetes command-line tool that allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. If you don't have `kubectl` installed, you can follow the instructions provided on the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl){target=_blank}.

    To create resources such as namespaces, pods, and CronJobs within the target cluster, you must have the appropriate permissions granted to your user or service account. These permissions are essential for managing and deploying applications effectively within Kubernetes.

=== "Features"
    In Kubernetes, Zombienet uses the Prometheus operator (if available) to oversee monitoring and visibility. This configuration ensures that only essential networking-related pods are deployed. Using the Prometheus operator, Zombienet improves its ability to efficiently monitor and manage network activities within the Kubernetes cluster. 

### Podman

=== "Requirements"
    Zombienet supports Podman rootless as a provider. To use Podman as a provider, you need to have Podman installed on your system. Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and container images on Linux-based systems. You can install Podman by following the instructions provided on the [Podman website](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation){target=_blank}.

=== "Features"
    Using Podman, Zombienet deploys additional pods to enhance the monitoring and visibility of the active network. Specifically, pods for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=_blank}, [Tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/operations/monitor/){target=_blank}, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/){target=_blank} are included in the deployment. Grafana is configured with Prometheus and Tempo as data sources.

    Upon launching Zombienet, access to these monitoring services is facilitated through specific URLs provided in the output:

    - Prometheus - [http://127.0.0.1:34123](http://127.0.0.1:34123){target=_blank}
    - Tempo - [http://127.0.0.1:34125](http://127.0.0.1:34125){target=_blank}
    - Grafana - [http://127.0.0.1:41461](http://127.0.0.1:41461){target=_blank}

    It's important to note that Grafana is deployed with default administrator access. 
    
    When network operations cease, either by halting a running spawn with `Ctrl+C` or upon completion of the test, Zombienet automatically removes all associated pods.

!!! warning
    Currently, Podman can only be used with Zombienet on Linux machines. Although Podman has support for macOS through an internal VM, the Zombienet provider code requires Podman to run natively on Linux.

### Local

=== "Requirements"
    The Zombienet local provider, also referred to as native, enables you to run nodes as local processes in your environment. You must have the necessary binaries for your network (such as `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain`). These binaries should be available in your PATH, allowing Zombienet to spawn the nodes as local processes.

    To install the necessary binaries, you can use the Zombienet CLI command:

    ```bash
    zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    This command will download and prepare the necessary binaries for Zombienetâ€™s use.

    !!! warning
        The `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain` binaries releases aren't compatible with macOS. As a result, macOS users will need to clone the [Polkadot repository](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=_blank}, build the Polkadot binary, and manually add it to their PATH for `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain` to work.

    If you need to use a custom binary, ensure the binary is available in your PATH. You can also specify the binary path in the network configuration file. To showcase this, this guide will use the custom [OpenZeppelin template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates){target=_blank} as an example.

    First, clone the OpenZeppelin template repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates \
    && cd polkadot-runtime-templates/generic-template

    Then, build the custom binary:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

    After that, add the custom binary to your PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/polkadot-runtime-templates/parachain-template-node/target/release
    ```

    Alternatively, you can specify the binary path in the network configuration file:

    ```toml
    [relaychain]
    chain = "rococo-local"
    default_command = "./bin-v1.6.0/polkadot"

    [parachain]
    id = 1000

	    [parachain.collators]
	    name = "collator01"
	    command = "./target/release/parachain-template-node"
    ```

    !!! note
        The local provider exclusively utilizes the command configuration for nodes/collators, which supports both relative and absolute paths. You can employ the `default_command` configuration to specify the binary for spawning all nodes in the relay chain.

=== "Features"
    Currently, the local provider doesn't execute any additional layers or processes.

## CLI Usage

Zombienet provides a CLI that allows interaction with the tool. The CLI can receive commands and flags to perform different kinds of operations. These operations can be initiated using the following syntax:

```bash
zombienet <arguments> <commands>

## Spawn a Basic Network

In following sections, you'll learn how to set up a basic network using Zombienet and run a simple test to validate its functionality. The example provided walks you through defining a minimal network configuration, spawning the network, and interacting with the nodes. By the end, you'll clearly understand how to use Zombienet to deploy and test ephemeral blockchain networks, setting the stage for more complex scenarios.

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, first, you need to have Zombienet installed. If you haven't done so, please follow the instructions in the [Installation](#install-zombienet) section.

### Define the Network

As mentioned in the [Configuration Files](#configuration-files) section, Zombienet uses a configuration file to define the ephemeral network that will be spawned. To follow this tutorial, create a file named `spawn-a-basic-network.toml` with the following content:

```toml title="spawn-a-basic-network.toml"
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/blockchain/spawn-testing-chain/spawn-a-basic-network.toml'
```

This configuration file defines a network with a relaychain with two nodes, `alice` and `bob`, and a parachain with a collator named `collator01`. Also, it sets a timeout of 120 seconds for the network to be ready.

### Run the Network

To spawn the network, run the following command:

```bash
zombienet -p native spawn spawn-a-basic-network.toml
```

This command will spawn the network defined in the `spawn-a-basic-network.toml` configuration file. The `-p native` flag specifies that the network will be spawned using the native provider.

If successful, you will see the following output:

--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/blockchain/spawn-testing-chain/spawn-network-terminal-01.html'

!!! note 
    If the IPs and ports aren't explicitly defined in the configuration file, they may change each time the network is started, causing the links provided in the output to differ from the example.

### Interact with the Spawned Network

After the network is launched, you can interact with it using [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank}. To do so, open your browser and use the provided links listed by the output as `Direct Link`.

#### Connect to the Nodes

In this particular case, as the ports may vary from spawning to spawning, to interact with the `alice` node, open [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:55308#explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:55308#explorer){target=\_blank} as it is the link provided in the output for the `alice` node. Moreover, you can also do this for the `bob` and `collator01` nodes.

If you want to interact with the nodes more programmatically, you can also use the [Polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/){target=\_blank}. For example, the following code snippet shows how to connect to the `alice` node using the Polkadot.js API and log some information about the chain and node:

```typescript
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/blockchain/spawn-testing-chain/connect-to-alice-01.js'
```

Either way allows you to interact easily with the network and its nodes.

#### Checking Metrics

You can also check the metrics of the nodes by accessing the provided links listed by the output as `Prometheus Link`. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=_blank} is a monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from the nodes. By accessing the provided links, you can see the metrics of the nodes in a web interface. So, for example, the following image shows the Prometheus metrics for Bobâ€™s node from the Zombienet test:

![Prometheus metrics for Bobâ€™s node from the Zombienet test](/images/develop/toolkit/blockchain/spawn-testing-chain/zombienet-tutorials-1.webp)

#### Checking Logs

To check the nodesâ€™ logs, you can use the provided command listed by the output as 'Log Cmd'. For instance, to check the logs of the `alice` node, you can open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
tail -f /var/folders/f4/7rdt2m9d7j361dm453cpggbm0000gn/T/zombie-75a01b93c92d571f6198a67bcb380fcd_21724-SEzfCidQ1za4/alice.log
```

After running this command, you will see the logs of the `alice` node in real-time, which can be useful for debugging purposes. The logs of the `bob` and `collator01` nodes can be checked similarly.

### Testing DSL

Zombienet provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing tests. The DSL is designed to be human-readable and allows you to write tests using natural language expressions. You can define assertions and tests against the spawned network using this DSL. This way, users can evaluate different metrics, such as:

- **On-chain storage** - the storage of each of the chains running via Zombienet
- **Metrics** - the metrics provided by the nodes
- **Histograms** - visual representations of metrics data
- **Logs** - detailed records of system activities and events
- **System events** - notifications of significant occurrences within the network
- **Tracing** - detailed analysis of execution paths and operations
- **Custom API calls (through Polkadot.js)** - personalized interfaces for interacting with the network
- **Commands** - instructions or directives executed by the network

These abstractions are expressed by sentences defined in a natural language style. Therefore, each test line will be mapped to a test to run. Also, the test file (`*.zndsl`) includes pre-defined header fields used to define information about the suite, such as network configuration and credentials location.

### The Test File

The test file is a text file with the extension `.zndsl`. It is divided into two parts: the header and the body. The header contains the network configuration and the credentials to use, while the body contains the tests to run.

The header is defined by the following fields:

- `description` ++"string"++ - long description of the test suite (optional)
- `network` ++"string"++ - path to the network definition file, supported in both `.json` and `.toml` formats
- `creds` ++"string"++ - credentials filename or path to use (available only with Kubernetes provider). Looks in the current directory or `$HOME/.kube/` if a filename is passed

The body contains the tests to run. Each test is defined by a sentence in the DSL, which is mapped to a test to run. Each test line defines an assertion or a command to be executed against the spawned network.

#### Name

The test name in Zombienet is derived from the filename by removing any leading numeric characters before the first hyphen. For example, a file named `0001-zombienet-test.zndsl` will result in a test name of `zombienet-test`, which will be displayed in the test report output of the runner.

#### Assertions

Assertions are defined by sentences in the DSL that evaluate different metrics, such as on-chain storage, metrics, histograms, logs, system events, tracing, and custom API calls. Each assertion is defined by a sentence in the DSL, which is mapped to a test to run.

??? interface "`Custom TS scripts` - run a custom TS script and assert on the return value"

    === "Syntax"

        - `node-name ts-script script_relative_path [return is comparator target_value] [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash

        ```

??? interface "`Backchannel` - wait for a value and register to use"

    === "Syntax"

        - `node-name wait for var name and use as X [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        alice: wait for name and use as X within 30 seconds
        ```

#### Commands

Commands allow interaction with the nodes and can run pre-defined commands or an arbitrary command in the node.

??? interface "`restart` - stop the process and start again after the `X` amount of seconds or immediately"

    === "Syntax"

        - `node-name restart [after x seconds]`

??? interface "`pause` - pause (SIGSTOP) the process"

    === "Syntax"

        - `node-name pause`

??? interface "`resume` - resume (SIGCONT) the process"

    === "Syntax"

        - `node-name resume`

??? interface "`sleep` - sleep the test-runner for `x` amount of seconds"

    === "Syntax"

        - `sleep x`

### Running a Test

To run a test against the spawned network, you can use the [Zombienet DSL](#testing-dsl) to define the test scenario. 

For example, you can create a file named `spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl` with the following content:

```toml title="spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl"
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/blockchain/spawn-testing-chain/spawn-a-basic-network-test-zndsl.toml'
```

This test scenario checks to verify the following:

- the nodes are running
- the parachain with ID 100 is registered within a certain timeframe (255 seconds in this example)
- the parachain block height is at least a certain number within a timeframe (in this case, 10 within 255 seconds)
- the nodes report metrics 

However, you can define any test scenario following the Zombienet DSL syntax.

To run the test, execute the following command:

```bash
zombienet -p native test spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl
```

This command will execute the test scenario defined in the `spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl` file on the network. If successful, the terminal will display the test output, indicating whether the test passed or failed.

### Example Test Files

The following example test files define two tests, a small network test and a big network test. Each test defines a network configuration file and credentials to use.

The tests define assertions to evaluate the networkâ€™s metrics and logs. The assertions are defined by sentences in the DSL, which are mapped to tests to run.

```toml title="small-network-test.zndsl"
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/blockchain/spawn-testing-chain/example-test-01.toml'
```

And the second test file:

```toml title="big-network-test.zndsl"
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/blockchain/spawn-testing-chain/example-test-02.toml'
```
