# E2E Testing with Moonwall

## Introduction

Moonwall is an end-to-end testing framework designed explicitly for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. It addresses one of the most significant challenges in blockchain development: managing complex test environments and network configurations.

Moonwall consolidates this complexity by providing the following:

- A centralized configuration management system that explicitly defines all network parameters
- A standardized approach to environment setup across different Substrate-based chains
- Built-in utilities for common testing scenarios and network interactions

Developers can focus on writing meaningful tests rather than managing infrastructure complexities or searching through documentation for configuration options.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank} (version 20.10 or higher)
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}, or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/){target=\_blank}

## Install Moonwall

Moonwall can be installed globally for system-wide access or locally within specific projects. This section covers both installation methods.

!!! tip
    This documentation corresponds to Moonwall version `{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}`. To avoid compatibility issues with the documented features, ensure you're using the matching version.

### Global Installation

Global installation provides system-wide access to the Moonwall CLI, making it ideal for developers working across multiple blockchain projects. Install it by running one of the following commands:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install -g @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm -g install @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn global add @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

Now, you can run the `moonwall` command from your terminal.

### Local Installation

Local installation is recommended for better dependency management and version control within a specific project. First, initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir my-moonwall-project
cd my-moonwall-project
npm init -y
```

Then, install it as a local dependency:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

## Initialize Moonwall

The `moonwall init` command launches an interactive wizard to create your configuration file:

```bash
moonwall init
```

During setup, you will see prompts for the following parameters:

- **`label`** - identifies your test configuration
- **`global timeout`** - maximum time (ms) for test execution
- **`environment name`** - name for your testing environment
- **`network foundation`** - type of blockchain environment to use
- **`tests directory`** - location of your test files

Select `Enter` to accept defaults or input custom values. You should see something like this:

--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/parachains/e2e-testing/moonwall/init.html'

The wizard generates a `moonwall.config` file:

```json
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/parachains/e2e-testing/moonwall/init-moonwall.config.json'
```

The default configuration requires specific details about your blockchain node and test requirements:

- The `foundation` object defines how your test blockchain node will be launched and managed. The dev foundation, which runs a local node binary, is used for local development
    
For more information about available options, check the [Foundations](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/foundations.html){target=\_blank} section.

- The `connections` array specifies how your tests will interact with the blockchain node. This typically includes provider configuration and endpoint details
    
A provider is a tool that allows you or your application to connect to a blockchain network and simplifies the low-level details of the process. A provider handles submitting transactions, reading state, and more. For more information on available providers, check the [Providers supported](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/providers.html#providers-supported){target=\_blank} page in the Moonwall documentation.

Here's a complete configuration example for testing a local node using Polkadot.js as a provider:

```json
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/parachains/e2e-testing/moonwall/moonwall.config.json'
```

## Writing Tests

Moonwall uses the [`describeSuite`](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/moonwall/blob/7568048c52e9f7844f38fb4796ae9e1b9205fdaa/packages/cli/src/lib/runnerContext.ts#L65){target=\_blank} function to define test suites, like using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/){target=\_blank}. Each test suite requires the following:

- **`id`** - unique identifier for the suite
- **`title`** - descriptive name for the suite
- **`foundationMethods`** - specifies the testing environment (e.g., `dev` for local node testing)
- **`testCases`** - a callback function that houses the individual test cases of this suite

The following example shows how to test a balance transfer between two accounts:

```ts
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/parachains/e2e-testing/moonwall/test1.ts'
```

This test demonstrates several key concepts:

- Initializing the Polkadot.js API through Moonwall's context and setting up test accounts
- Querying on-chain state
- Executing transactions
- Waiting for block inclusion
- Verifying results using assertions

## Running the Tests

Execute your tests using the `test` Moonwall CLI command. For the default environment setup run:

```bash
moonwall test default_env -c moonwall.config
```

The test runner will output detailed results showing:

- Test suite execution status
- Individual test case results
- Execution time
- Detailed logs and error messages (if any)

Example output:
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/parachains/e2e-testing/moonwall/output.html'
