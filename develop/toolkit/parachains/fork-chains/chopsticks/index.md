# Fork Live Chains with Chopsticks

Chopsticks is a powerful tool that lets you create local copies of running Polkadot SDK-based networks. By forking live chains locally, you can safely test features, analyze network behavior, and simulate complex scenarios without affecting production networks.

## What Can I Do with Chopsticks?

- Create local forks of live networks
- Replay blocks to analyze behavior
- Test XCM interactions
- Simulate complex scenarios
- Modify network storage and state

Whether you're debugging an issue, testing new features, or exploring cross-chain interactions, Chopsticks provides a safe environment for blockchain experimentation and validation.
