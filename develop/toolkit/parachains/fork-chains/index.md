# Fork Live Chains for Testing

Explore tools for forking live blockchain networks, enabling you to replicate real-world conditions in a local environment for accurate testing and debugging. These tools allow you to analyze network behavior, test new features, and simulate complex scenarios in a controlled environment without affecting production systems.

## Chopsticks

With [Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/){target=\_blank}, you can create and manipulate local forks of Polkadot networks:

- Fork live chains for local testing
- Analyze network behavior
- Simulate cross-chain interactions

Through forking tools, you can:

- Test features safely before deployment
- Debug complex interactions
- Validate runtime changes
- Experiment with network modifications
