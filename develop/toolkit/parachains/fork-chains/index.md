# Fork Live Chains for Testing

Explore tools for forking live blockchain networks. These tools enable you to replicate real-world conditions in a local environment for accurate testing and debugging. They also allow you to analyze network behavior, test new features, and simulate complex scenarios in a controlled environment without affecting production systems.

## Why Fork a Live Chain?

Forking a live chain creates a controlled environment that mirrors live network conditions. This approach enables you to:

- Test features safely before deployment
- Debug complex interactions
- Validate runtime changes
- Experiment with network modifications
