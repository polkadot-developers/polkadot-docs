# RPC Calls

## Introduction

[Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call){target=\_blank} (RPC) interfaces are the primary way to interact programmatically with Polkadot SDK-based parachains and relay chains. RPC calls allow you to query chain state, submit transactions, and monitor network health from external applications or scripts.

This guide covers:

- What RPC calls are and how they work in the Polkadot SDK.
- How to make RPC calls using `curl` or similar tools.
- The most useful and commonly used RPC methods.

RPC endpoints are available on every node and can be accessed via HTTP and WebSocket. Most developer tools, dashboards, and libraries (like [Polkadot.js](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/polkadot-js-api){target=\_blank}, [Subxt](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/subxt){target=\_blank}, and others) utilize these endpoints internally.

## How Do RPC Calls Work?

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol that allows you to invoke functions on a remote server (in this case, a blockchain node) as if they were local. Polkadot SDK nodes implement the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification){target=\_blank} standard, making it easy to interact with them using standard HTTP requests.

```

RPC calls are stateless and can be used to:

- Query chain state (e.g., block number, storage values).
- Submit extrinsics (transactions).
- Monitor node and network health.
- Retrieve metadata and runtime information.

## Making RPC Calls with Curl

You can make RPC calls to a node using [`curl`](https://curl.se/){target=\_blank} or any HTTP client. The general format that the RPC calls stick to is the following:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "INSERT_METHOD_NAME", "params": [INSERT_PARAMS]}' \
  NODE_ENDPOINT
```

- **`method`**: The RPC method you want to call (e.g., `system_health`).
- **`params`**: Parameters for the method (if any).
- **`NODE_ENDPOINT`**: The HTTP endpoint of your node (e.g., `http://localhost:9933` or a public endpoint).

Here's a simple example to get the latest block number of the Polkadot relay chain; you can use the following node endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "chain_getBlock"}' \
  https://rpc.polkadot.io
```

## Essential RPC Methods

Below are some of the most useful and commonly used RPC methods for Polkadot SDK-based chains. Each method includes a description, parameters, and an example request.

---

### system_health

Checks the health of your node.

**Parameters:**

None.

**Example:**

```bash title="system_health"
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "system_health", "params":[]}' \
    http://localhost:9933
```

---

### chain_getBlock

Returns the latest block or a specific block by hash.

**Parameters:**

- `blockHash` *(optional, string)* – The hash of the block to retrieve. If omitted, returns the latest block.

**Example:**

```bash title="chain_getBlock"
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "chain_getBlock", "params":[]}' \
    http://localhost:9933
```

---

### state_getStorage

Queries on-chain storage by key (requires [SCALE-encoded](/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/data-encoding){target=_blank} storage key).

**Parameters:**

- `storageKey` *(string)* – The SCALE-encoded storage key to query.

**Example:**

```bash title="state_getStorage"
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getStorage", "params":["0x..."]}' \
    http://localhost:9933
```

---

### author_submitExtrinsic

Submits a signed extrinsic (transaction) to the node.

**Parameters:**

- `extrinsic` *(string)* – The SCALE-encoded, signed extrinsic (transaction).

**Example:**

```bash title="author_submitExtrinsic"
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_submitExtrinsic", "params":["0x..."]}' \
    http://localhost:9933
```

---

### state_getMetadata

Fetches the runtime metadata (needed for decoding storage and extrinsics).

**Parameters:**

None.

**Example:**

```bash title="state_getMetadata"
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getMetadata", "params":[]}' \
    http://localhost:9933
```

## Check Available RPC Calls

To check all the RPC methods exposed by your node, you can use the `rpc_methods` call to get a comprehensive list of available methods. This is particularly useful when working with different chain implementations or custom runtimes that may have additional RPC endpoints. You can do this via [`curl`](#using-curl) or the [Polkadot.Js Apps](#using-polkadotjs-apps).

### Using curl

To check the available RPC methods using `curl`, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "rpc_methods", "params":[]}' \
  https://rpc.polkadot.io
```

You can replace `https://rpc.polkadot.io` with the node endpoint you need to query.

### Using Polkadot.js Apps

1. Go to the [Polkadot.js Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps){target=\_blank} and navigate to the RPC calls section.

2. Select **`rpc`** from the dropdown menu.

3. Choose the **`methods`** method.

    ![](/images/develop/toolkit/parachains/rpc-calls/rpc-calls-03.webp)

4. Submit the call to get a list of all available RPC methods.

    ![](/images/develop/toolkit/parachains/rpc-calls/rpc-calls-04.webp)

This will return a JSON response containing all the RPC methods supported by your node.

From this interface, you can also query the RPC methods directly, as you would do with curl.
