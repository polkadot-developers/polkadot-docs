# Test Networks with Zombienet

Zombienet is a testing framework that lets you quickly spin up ephemeral blockchain networks for development and testing. With support for multiple deployment targets like Kubernetes, Podman and native environments, Zombienet makes it easy to validate your blockchain implementation in a controlled setting.

## Getting Started
Begin by setting up Zombienet in your development environment:

- [Install Zombienet](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/){target=\_blank} - Install and configure Zombienet with your preferred provider 
- [Write Tests](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/write-tests/){target=\_blank} - Create test scenarios using Zombienet's natural language testing DSL

Through Zombienet, you can:

- Deploy test networks with multiple nodes
- Validate network behavior and performance  
- Monitor metrics and system events
- Execute custom test scenarios

Whether you're building a new parachain or testing runtime upgrades, Zombienet provides the tools needed to ensure your blockchain functions correctly before deployment to production.
