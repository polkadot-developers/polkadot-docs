## Need More than just Documentation?

You're already in the docs — solid start.  
But sometimes you need more: answers, real examples, someone to talk to.  
This Support Hub is here to help you move forward — faster.

Whether you're building something new, integrating into the ecosystem, or running into blockers — **don't stay stuck**.

## What You can do Here

- 📨 [**Get In Touch**](./get-in-touch)  
  Reach out to the Polkadot support team and community via Telegram, Matrix, or Discord.  
  Ask technical questions, report blockers, or share feedback — and get a human response.

- 🧠 [**Explore Available Resources**](./explore-resources)  
  Find answers beyond the documentation: developer forums, Stack Exchange, Reddit, YouTube, governance hubs, and more.

This hub is evolving. More support tools and shortcuts are on the way —  
including better onboarding, CLI helpers, dev environments, and live feedback channels.

## Help us Improve

If something’s missing, unclear, or broken — **tell us**.  
Your feedback makes the whole ecosystem better for everyone.

👉 [**Get In Touch**](./get-in-touch) and help shape the future of developer support.
