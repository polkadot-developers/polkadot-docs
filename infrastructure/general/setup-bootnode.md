!!!note
    When you first start a node, it has to find a way to find other nodes in the network. For that
    purpose, you need "bootnodes". After the first bootnode is found, it can use that nodeâ€™s connections
    to continue expanding and play its role in the network, like participating as a validator.

<!-- TODO: link wss guide wherever applicable. -->

## Accessing the Bootnode

The consensus is that bootnodes have to be accessible in three ways:

- **P2P**: the p2p port, which can be set by `--listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/<port>`. This port is
  not automatically set on a non-validator node (for example, an archive RPC node)
- **P2P/WS**: the websocket version, which can be set by `--listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/<port>/ws`
- **P2P/WSS**: the _secure_ websocket version. An SSL-secured connection to the p2p/ws port must be
  achieved by a proxy since the node cannot include certificates. It is needed for light clients.

## Network Key

Starting a node creates its node key in the `chains/<chain>/network/secret_ed25519` file. You can
also create a node-key by `polkadot key generate-node-key` and use that node-key in the startup
command line.

It is essential you backup the node key, especially if it gets included in the `polkadot` binary
because it gets hardcoded in the binary and needs to be recompiled to change.

## Running the Bootnode

A boot node can be run as follows:

 ```
 polkadot --chain polkadot --name dot-bootnode --listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30310 --listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30311/ws
 ```

This would have the p2p on port 30310 and p2p/ws on port 30311. For the p2p/wss port, a proxy would need to
set up, a DNS name, and a corresponding certificate. The following example is for the popular nginx server and enables p2p/wss on port 30312 by adding a proxy to the p2p/ws port 30311:

_/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dot-bootnode_

```
server {
       listen       30312 ssl http2 default_server;
       server_name  dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io;
       root         /var/www/html;

       ssl_certificate "<your_cert";
       ssl_certificate_key "<your_key>";

       location / {
         proxy_buffers 16 4k;
         proxy_buffer_size 2k;
         proxy_pass http://localhost:30311;
         proxy_http_version 1.1;
         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
         proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
         proxy_set_header Host $host;
   }

}
```

## Testing Bootnode Connection

If the preceding node is running with DNS name `dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io`, which contains a proxy with a valid
certificate and node-id `12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg` then the following
commands should give you a: `syncing 1 peers`.

!!!tip
    You can add `-lsub-libp2p=trace` on the end to get libp2p trace logging for debugging purposes.

### P2P

```bash
polkadot --chain polkadot --base-path /tmp/node --name "Bootnode testnode" --reserved-only --reserved-nodes "/dns/dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io/tcp/30310/p2p/12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg" --no-hardware-benchmarks
```

### P2P/WS

```bash
polkadot --chain polkadot --base-path /tmp/node --name "Bootnode testnode" --reserved-only --reserved-nodes "/dns/dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io/tcp/30311/ws/p2p/12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg" --no-hardware-benchmarks
```

### P2P/WSS

```bash
polkadot --chain polkadot --base-path /tmp/node --name "Bootnode testnode" --reserved-only --reserved-nodes "/dns/dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io/tcp/30312/wss/p2p/12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg" --no-hardware-benchmarks
