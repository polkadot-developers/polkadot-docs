# Infrastructure

Running infrastructure on Polkadot is essential to supporting the network’s performance and security. Operators must focus on reliability, ensure proper configuration, and meet the necessary hardware requirements to contribute effectively to the decentralized ecosystem.

## Choosing the Right Role

Selecting your role within the Polkadot ecosystem depends on your goals, resources, and expertise. Below are detailed considerations for each role:

- **Running a node**:
    - **Purpose** - a node provides access to network data and supports API queries. It is commonly used for:
        - **Development and testing** - offers a local instance to simulate network conditions and test applications
        - **Production use** - acts as a data source for dApps, clients, and other applications needing reliable access to the blockchain
    - **Requirements** - moderate hardware resources to handle blockchain data efficiently
    - **Responsibilities** - a node’s responsibilities vary based on its purpose:
        - **Development and testing** - enables developers to test features, debug code, and simulate network interactions in a controlled environment
        - **Production use** - provides consistent and reliable data access for dApps and other applications, ensuring minimal downtime

- **Running a validator**:
    - **Purpose** - validators play a critical role in securing the Polkadot relay chain. They validate parachain block submissions, participate in consensus, and help maintain the network's overall integrity
    - **Requirements** - becoming a validator requires:
        - **Staking** - a variable amount of DOT tokens to secure the network and demonstrate commitment
        - **Hardware** - high-performing hardware resources capable of supporting intensive blockchain operations
        - **Technical expertise** - proficiency in setting up and maintaining nodes, managing updates, and understanding Polkadot's consensus mechanisms
        - **Community involvement** - building trust and rapport within the community to attract nominators willing to stake with your validator
    - **Responsibilities** - validators have critical responsibilities to ensure network health:
        - **Uptime** - maintain near-constant availability to avoid slashing penalties for downtime or unresponsiveness
        - **Network security** - participate in consensus and verify parachain transactions to uphold the network's security and integrity
        - **Availability** - monitor the network for events and respond to issues promptly, such as misbehavior reports or protocol updates
