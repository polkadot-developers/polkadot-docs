# General Management

## Introduction

Validator performance is pivotal in maintaining the security and stability of the Polkadot network. As a validator, optimizing your setup ensures efficient transaction processing, minimizes latency, and maintains system reliability during high-demand periods. Proper configuration and proactive monitoring also help mitigate risks like slashing and service interruptions.

This guide covers essential practices for managing a validator, including performance tuning techniques, security hardening, and tools for real-time monitoring. Whether you're fine-tuning CPU settings, configuring NUMA balancing, or setting up a robust alert system, these steps will help you build a resilient and efficient validator operation.

## Configuration Optimization

For those seeking to optimize their validator's performance, the following configurations can improve responsiveness, reduce latency, and ensure consistent performance during high-demand periods.

### Deactivate Simultaneous Multithreading

Polkadot validators operate primarily in single-threaded mode for critical tasks, so optimizing single-core CPU performance can reduce latency and improve stability. Deactivating simultaneous multithreading (SMT) can prevent virtual cores from affecting performance. SMT is called Hyper-Threading on Intel and 2-way SMT on AMD Zen.

Take the following steps to deactivate every other (vCPU) core:

1. Loop though all the CPU cores and deactivate the virtual cores associated with them:

    ```bash
    for cpunum in $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/thread_siblings_list | \
    cut -s -d, -f2- | tr ',' '\n' | sort -un)
    do
    echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$cpunum/online
    done
    ```

2. To permanently save the changes, add `nosmt=force` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable in `/etc/default/grub`:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    # Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
    ```

    ```config title="/etc/default/grub"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/grub-config-01.js:1:7'
    ```

3. Update GRUB to apply changes:

    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    ```

4. After the reboot, you should see that half of the cores are offline. To confirm, run:

    ```bash
    lscpu --extended
    ```

### Deactivate Automatic NUMA Balancing

Deactivating NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) balancing for multi-CPU setups helps keep processes on the same CPU node, minimizing latency.

Follow these stpes:

1. Deactivate NUMA balancing in runtime:

    ```bash
    sysctl kernel.numa_balancing=0
    ```

2. Deactivate NUMA balancing permanently by adding `numa_balancing=disable` to the GRUB settings:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    # Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
    ```

    ```config title="/etc/default/grub"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/grub-config-01.js:9:15'
    ```

3. Update GRUB to apply changes:

    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    ```

4. Confirm the deactivation:

    ```bash
    sysctl -a | grep 'kernel.numa_balancing'
    ```

If you successfully deactivated NUMA balancing, the preceding command should return `0`.

### Spectre and Meltdown Mitigations

[Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)){target=\_blank} and [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)){target=\_blank} are well-known CPU vulnerabilities that exploit speculative execution to access sensitive data. These vulnerabilities have been patched in recent Linux kernels, but the mitigations can slightly impact performance, especially in high-throughput or containerized environments.

If your security requirements allow it, you can deactivate specific mitigations, such as Spectre V2 and Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD), to improve performance.

To selectively deactivate the Spectre mitigations, take these steps:

1. Update the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable in your `/etc/default/grub` configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    # Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
    ```

    ```config title="/etc/default/grub"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/grub-config-01.js:17:23'
    ```

2. Update GRUB to apply changes and then reboot:

```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

This approach selectively deactivates the Spectre V2 and Spectre V4 mitigations, leaving other protections intact. For full security, keep mitigations activated unless there's a significant performance need, as disabling them could expose the system to potential attacks on affected CPUs.

## Monitor Your Node

Monitoring your node's performance is critical for network reliability and security. Tools like the following provide valuable insights:

- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank}** - an open-source monitoring toolkit for collecting and querying time-series data
- **[Grafana](https://grafana.com/){target=\_blank}** - a visualization tool for real-time metrics, providing interactive dashboards
- **[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/){target=\_blank}** - a tool for managing and routing alerts based on Prometheus data.

This section covers setting up these tools and configuring alerts to notify you of potential issues.

### Environment Setup

Before installing Prometheus, ensure the environment is set up securely by running Prometheus with restricted user privileges.

Follow these steps:

1. Create a Prometheus user to ensure Prometheus runs with minimal permissions:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus
    ```

2. Create directories for configuration and data storage:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
    ```
  
3. Change directory ownership to ensure Prometheus has access:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
    ```

### Install and Configure Prometheus

After setting up the environment, install and configure the latest version of Prometheus as follows:

1. Download Prometheus for your system architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/){target=\_blank}. Replace `INSERT_RELEASE_DOWNLOAD` with the release binary URL (e.g., `https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.0.0/prometheus-3.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz`):

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    wget INSERT_RELEASE_DOWNLOAD_LINK
    tar xfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
    cd prometheus-3.0.0.linux-amd64
    ```

2. Set up Prometheus:

    1. Copy binaries:

        ```bash
        sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
        sudo cp ./promtool /usr/local/bin/
        sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
        ```

    2. Copy directories and assign ownership of these files to the `prometheus` user:

        ```bash
        sudo cp -r ./consoles /etc/prometheus
        sudo cp -r ./console_libraries /etc/prometheus
        sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
        sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries
        ```

    3. Clean up the download directory:

        ```bash
        cd .. && rm -r prometheus*
        ```

3. Create `prometheus.yml` to define global settings, rule files, and scrape targets:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

    ```yaml title="prometheus-config.yml"
    --8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/prometheus-config.yml'
    ```

    Prometheus is scraped every 5 seconds in this example configuration file, ensuring detailed internal metrics. Node metrics with customizable intervals are scraped from port `9615` by default.

4. Verify the configuration with `promtool`, an open source monitoring tool:

    ```bash
    promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

5. Save the configuration and change the ownership of the file to `prometheus` user:

    ```bash
    sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

### Start Prometheus

1. Launch Prometheus with the appropriate configuration file, storage location, and necessary web resources, running it with restricted privileges for security:

    ```bash
    sudo -u prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
    ```

    If you set the server up properly, you should see terminal output similar to the following:

    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/terminal-ouput-01.html'

2. Verify you can access the Prometheus interface by navigating to:

    ```text
    http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9090/graph
    ```

    If the interface appears to work as expected, exit the process using `Control + C`.

3. Create a systemd service file to ensure Prometheus starts on boot:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
    ```

    ```bash title="prometheus.service"
    --8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/systemd-config.md'
    ```

4. Reload systemd and enable the service to start on boot:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable prometheus && sudo systemctl start prometheus
    ```

5. Verify the service is running by visiting the Prometheus interface again at:

    ```text
    http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9090/
    ```

    sudo mkdir /etc/alertmanager
    sudo nano /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
    ```

    Add the following code to the configuration file to define email notifications:

    ```yml title="alertmanager.yml"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/alertmanager.yml'
    ```

    !!! note "App password"
        You must generate an [app password in your Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en){target=\_blank} to enable email notifications from Alertmanager.

4. Ensure the configuration file has the correct permissions:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/alertmanager
    ```

5. Configure Alertmanager as a service by creating a systemd service file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service
    ```

    ```yml title="alertmanager.service"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/systemd-alert-config.md'
    ```

6. Reload and enable the service:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable alertmanager
    sudo systemctl start alertmanager
    ```

7. Verify the service status:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status alertmanager
    ```

    If you have configured Alertmanager properly, the **Active** field should display **active (running)** similar to below:

    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/alertmanager-status.html'

#### Grafana Plugin

There is an [Alertmanager plugin in Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/alertmanager/){target=\_blank} that can help you monitor alert information.

Follow these steps to use the plugin:

1. Install the plugin:

    ```bash
    sudo grafana-cli plugins install camptocamp-prometheus-alertmanager-datasource
    ```

2. Restart Grafana:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
    ```

3. Configure Alertmanager as a data source in your Grafana dashboard (`SERVER_IP:3000`):

    1. Go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** and search for **Prometheus Alertmanager**
    2. Enter the server URL and port for the Alertmanager service, and select **Save & Test** to verify the connection

4. Import the [8010](https://grafana.com/dashboards/8010){target=\_blank} dashboard for Alertmanager, selecting **Prometheus Alertmanager** in the last column, then select **Import**

#### Integrate Alertmanager

Complete the integration by following these steps to enable communication between Prometheus and Alertmanager and configure detection and alert rules:

1. Update the `etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` configuration file to include the following code:

    ```yml title="prometheus.yml"
    --8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/update-prometheus.yml:5:12'
    ```

    Expand the following item to view the complete `prometheus.yml` file.

    ??? code "prometheus.yml"

        ```yml title="prometheus.yml"
        --8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/update-prometheus.yml'
        ```

2. Create the rules file for detection and alerts:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/prometheus/rules.yml
    ```

    Add a sample rule to trigger email notifications for node downtime over five minutes:

    ```yml title="rules.yml"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/instance-down.yml'
    ```

    If any of the conditions defined in the rules file are met, an alert will be triggered. For more on alert rules, refer to [Alerting Rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/){target=\_blank} and [additional alerts](https://awesome-prometheus-alerts.grep.to/rules.html){target=\_blank}.

3. Update the file ownership to `prometheus`:

    ```bash
    sudo chown prometheus:prometheus rules.yml
    ```

4. Validate the rules syntax:

    ```bash
    sudo -u prometheus promtool check rules rules.yml
    ```

5. Restart Prometheus and Alertmanager:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart prometheus && sudo systemctl restart alertmanager
    ```

## Secure Your Validator

Validators in Polkadot's Proof of Stake (PoS) network play a critical role in maintaining network integrity and security by keeping the network in consensus and verifying state transitions. To ensure optimal performance and minimize risks, validators must adhere to strict guidelines around security and reliable operations.

### Key Management

Though they don't transfer funds, session keys are essential for validators as they sign messages related to consensus and parachains. Securing session keys is crucial as allowing them to be exploited or used across multiple nodes can lead to a loss of staked funds via [slashing](/infrastructure/staking-mechanics/offenses-and-slashes/){target=\_blank}.

Given the current limitations in high-availability setups and the risks associated with double-signing, it’s recommended to run only a single validator instance. Keys should be securely managed, and processes automated to minimize human error.

There are two approaches for generating session keys:

- **Generate and store in node** - using the `author.rotateKeys` RPC call. For most users, generating keys directly within the client is recommended. You must submit a session certificate from your staking proxy to register new keys. See the [How to Validate](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/){target=\_blank} guide for instructions on setting keys

- **Generate outside node and insert** - using the `author.setKeys` RPC call. This flexibility accommodates advanced security setups and should only be used by experienced validator operators

### Signing Outside the Client

Polkadot plans to support external signing, allowing session keys to reside in secure environments like Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). However, these modules can sign any payload they receive, potentially enabling an attacker to perform slashable actions.

### Secure-Validator Mode

Polkadot's Secure-Validator mode offers an extra layer of protection through strict filesystem, networking, and process sandboxing. This secure mode is activated by default if the machine meets the following requirements:

- **Linux (x86-64 architecture)** - usually Intel or AMD
- **Enabled `seccomp`** - this kernel feature facilitates a more secure approach for process management on Linux. Verify by running:

    ```bash
    cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_SECCOMP=
    ```

    If `seccomp` is enabled, you should see output similar to the following:

    ```bash
    CONFIG_SECCOMP=y
    ```

!!! note
    Optionally, **Linux 5.13** may also be used, as it provides access to even more strict filesystem protections.

### Linux Best Practices

Follow these best practices to keep your validator secure:

- Use a non-root user for all operations
- Regularly apply OS security patches
- Enable and configure a firewall
- Use key-based SSH authentication; deactivate password-based login
- Regularly back up data and harden your SSH configuration. Visit this [SSH guide](https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html){target=\_blank} for more details

### Validator Best Practices

Additional best practices can add an additional layer of security and operational reliability:

- Only run the Polkadot binary, and only listen on the configured p2p port
- Run on bare-metal machines, as opposed to virtual machines
- Provisioning of the validator machine should be automated and defined in code which is kept in private version control, reviewed, audited, and tested
- Generate and provide session keys in a secure way
- Start Polkadot at boot and restart if stopped for any reason
- Run Polkadot as a non-root user
- Establish and maintain an on-call rotation for managing alerts
- Establish and maintain a clear protocol with actions to perform for each level of each alert with an escalation policy
