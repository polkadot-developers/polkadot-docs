# Introduction to XCM

## Introduction

Polkadot’s unique value lies in its ability to enable interoperability between parachains and other blockchain systems. At the core of this capability is XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging)—a flexible messaging format that facilitates communication and collaboration between independent consensus systems.

With XCM, one chain can send intents to another one, fostering a more interconnected ecosystem. Although it was developed specifically for Polkadot, XCM is a universal format, usable in any blockchain environment. This guide provides an overview of XCM’s core principles, design, and functionality, alongside practical examples of its implementation.

## Messaging Format

XCM is not a protocol but a standardized [messaging format](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format){target=\_blank}. It defines the structure and behavior of messages but does not handle their delivery. This separation allows developers to focus on crafting instructions for target systems without worrying about transmission mechanics.

XCM messages are intent-driven, outlining desired actions for the receiving blockchain to consider and potentially alter its state. These messages do not directly execute changes; instead, they rely on the host chain's environment to interpret and implement them. By utilizing asynchronous composability, XCM facilitates efficient execution where messages can be processed independently of their original order, similar to how RESTful services handle HTTP requests without requiring sequential processing.

## The Four Principles of XCM

XCM adheres to four guiding principles that ensure robust and reliable communication across consensus systems:

- **Asynchronous** - XCM messages operate independently of sender acknowledgment, avoiding delays due to blocked processes
- **Absolute** - XCM messages are guaranteed to be delivered and interpreted accurately, in order, and timely. Once a message is sent, one can be sure it will be processed as intended
- **Asymmetric** - XCM messages follow the 'fire and forget' paradigm meaning no automatic feedback is provided to the sender. Any results must be communicated separately to the sender with an additional message back to the origin
- **Agnostic** - XCM operates independently of the specific consensus mechanisms, making it compatible across diverse systems

These principles guarantee that XCM provides a reliable framework for cross-chain communication, even in complex environments.

## The XCM Tech Stack

![Diagram of the XCM tech stack](/images/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/intro-to-xcm-01.webp)

The XCM tech stack is designed to faciliate seamless interoperable communication between chains that reside within the Polkadot ecosystem. XCM can be used to ecpress the meaning of the messages over each of the communicatio channels.

## Core Functionalities of XCM

XCM enhances cross-consensus communication by introducing several powerful features:

- **Programmability** - supports dynamic message handling, allowing for more comprehensive use cases. Includes branching logic, safe dispatches for version checks, and asset operations like NFT management
- **Functional Multichain Decomposition** - enables mechanisms such as remote asset locking, asset namespacing, and inter-chain state referencing, with contextual message identification 
- **Bridging** - establishes a universal reference framework for multi-hop setups, connecting disparate systems like Ethereum and Bitcoin with the Polkadot relay chain acting as a universal location

The standardized format for messages allows parachains to handle tasks like user balances, governance, and staking, freeing the Polkadot relay chain to focus on shared security. These features make XCM indispensable for implementing scalable and interoperable blockchain applications. 

## XCM Example

The following is a simplified XCM message demonstrating a token transfer from Alice to Bob on the same chain (ParaA).

```rust
let message = Xcm(vec![
    WithdrawAsset((Here, amount).into()),
    BuyExecution { 
        fees: (Here, amount).into(), 
        weight_limit: WeightLimit::Unlimited 
    },
    DepositAsset {
        assets: All.into(),
        beneficiary: MultiLocation {
            parents: 0,
            interior: Junction::AccountId32 {
                network: None,
                id: BOB.clone().into()
            }.into(),
        }.into()
    }
]);
```

The message consists of three instructions described as follows:

- [**WithdrawAsset**](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#withdrawasset){target=\_blank} - transfers a specified number of tokens from Alice's account to a holding register
```rust

```
    - `Here` - the native parachain token
    - `amount` - the number of tokens that are transferred

    The first instruction takes as an input the MultiAsset that should be withdrawn. The MultiAsset describes the native parachain token with the `Here` keyword. The `amount` parameter is the number of tokens that are transferred. The withdrawal account depends on the origin of the message. In this example the origin of the message is Alice. The `WithdrawAsset` instruction moves `amount` number of native tokens from Alice's account into the holding register.

- [**BuyExecution**](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#buyexecution){target=\_blank} - allocates fees to cover the execution [weight](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight){target=\_blank} of the XCM instructions
```rust
fees: (Here, amount).into(), 
        weight_limit: WeightLimit::Unlimited 
    },
```

    - `fees` - describes the asset in the holding register that should be used to pay for the weight 
    - `weight_limit` - defines the maximum fees that can be used to buy weight

- [**DepositAsset**](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#depositasset){target=\_blank} - moves the remaining tokens from the holding register to Bob’s account
```rust
assets: All.into(),
        beneficiary: MultiLocation {
            parents: 0,
            interior: Junction::AccountId32 {
                network: None,
                id: BOB.clone().into()
            }.into(),
        }.into()
    }
```

    - `All` - the wildcard for the asset(s) to be deposited. In this case, all assets in the holding register should be deposited
    
This step-by-step process showcases how XCM enables precise state changes within a blockchain system. You can find a complete XCM message example in the [XCM repository](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-docs/blob/main/examples/src/0_first_look/mod.rs){target=\_blank}.

## Overview

XCM revolutionizes cross-chain communication by enabling use cases such as:

- Token transfers between blockchains

# Send XCM Messages

## Introduction

One of the core FRAME pallets that enables parachains to engage in cross-chain communication using the Cross-Consensus Message (XCM) format is [`pallet-xcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/index.html){target=\_blank}. It facilitates the sending, execution, and management of XCM messages, thereby allowing parachains to interact with other chains within the ecosystem. Additionally, `pallet-xcm`, also referred to as the XCM pallet, supports essential operations like asset transfers, version negotiation, and message routing.

This page provides a detailed overview of the XCM pallet's key features, its primary roles in XCM operations, and the main extrinsics it offers. Whether aiming to execute XCM messages locally or send them to external chains, this guide covers the foundational concepts and practical applications you need to know.

## XCM Frame Pallet Overview

The [`pallet-xcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/index.html){target=\_blank} provides a set of pre-defined, commonly used [XCVM programs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#12-the-xcvm){target=\_blank} in the form of a [set of extrinsics](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/dispatchables/index.html){target=\blank}. This pallet provides some [default implementations](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#implementations){target=\_blank} for traits required by [`XcmConfig`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm_benchmarks/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmConfig){target=\_blank}. The [XCM executor](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/struct.XcmExecutor.html){target=\_blank} is also included as an associated type within the pallet's configuration. 

For further details about the XCM configuration, see the [XCM Configuration](/develop/interoperability/xcm-config/){target=\_blank} page.

Where the [XCM format](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format){target=\_blank} defines a set of instructions used to construct XCVM programs, `pallet-xcm` defines a set of extrinsics that can be utilized to build XCVM programs, either to target the local or external chains. The `pallet-xcm` functionality is divided into three categories:

- **Primitive** - dispatchable functions to execute XCM locally

- **High-level** - functions for asset transfers between chains

- **Version negotiation-specific** - functions for managing XCM version compability

### Key Roles of the XCM Pallet

The XCM pallet plays a central role in managing cross-chain messages, with its primary responsibilities including:

- **Execute XCM messages** - interacts with the XCM executor to validate and execute messages, adhering to predefined security and filter criteria

- **Send messages across chains** - allows authorized origins to send XCM messages, enabling controlled cross-chain communication

- **Reserve-based transfers and teleports** - supports asset movement between chains, governed by filters that restrict operations to authorized origins

- **XCM version negotiation** - ensures compatibility by selecting the appropriate XCM version for inter-chain communication

- **Asset trapping and recovery** - manages trapped assets, enabling safe reallocation or recovery when issues occur during cross-chain transfers

- **Support for XCVM operations** - oversees state and configuration requirements necessary for executing cross-consensus programs within the XCVM framework

## Primary Extrinsics of the XCM Pallet

This page will highlight the two **Primary Primitive Calls** responsible for sending and executing XCVM programs as dispatchable functions within the pallet.

### Execute

The [`execute`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.execute){target=\_blank} call directly interacts with the XCM executor, allowing for the execution of XCM messages originating from a locally signed origin. The executor validates the message, ensuring it complies with any configured barriers or filters before executing.

Once validated, the message is executed locally, and an event is emitted to indicate the result—whether the message was fully executed or only partially completed. Execution is capped by a maximum weight ([`max_weight`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.execute.field.max_weight){target=\_blank}); if the required weight exceeds this limit, the message will not be executed.

```rust
pub fn execute<T: Config>(
    message: Box<VersionedXcm<<T as Config>::RuntimeCall>>,
    max_weight: Weight,
)
```

For further details about the `execute` extrinsic, see the [`pallet-xcm` documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank}.

!!!warning
    Partial execution of messages may occur depending on the constraints or barriers applied.

<!-- TODO: we should complement this page with some real examples of where the .execute() call is used, or maybe how to use it through papi or something like that -->

### Send

The [`send`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.send){target=\_blank} call enables XCM messages to be sent to a specified destination. This could be a parachain, smart contract, or any external system governed by consensus. Unlike the execute call, the message is not executed locally but is transported to the destination chain for processing.

The destination is defined using a [Location](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/xcm_docs/glossary/index.html#location){target=\_blank}, which describes the target chain or system. This ensures precise delivery through the configured XCM transport mechanism.

```rust
pub fn send<T: Config>(
    dest: Box<MultiLocation>,
    message: Box<VersionedXcm<<T as Config>::RuntimeCall>>,
)
```

For further information about the `send` extrinsic, see the [`pallet-xcm` documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank}.

<!-- TODO: we should complement this page with some real examples of where the .send() call is used, or maybe how to use it through papi or something like that -->

## XCM Router

The [`XcmRouter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmRouter){target=\_blank} is a critical component the XCM pallet requires to facilitate sending XCM messages. It defines where messages can be sent and determines the appropriate XCM transport protocol for the operation.

For instance, the Kusama network employs the [`ChildParachainRouter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_common/xcm_sender/struct.ChildParachainRouter.html){target=\_blank}, which restricts routing to [Downward Message Passing (DMP)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport#dmp-downward-message-passing){target=\_blank} from the relay chain to parachains, ensuring secure and controlled communication.

```rust
// Only one router so far - use DMP to communicate with child parachains.
	ChildParachainRouter<Runtime, XcmPallet, PriceForChildParachainDelivery>,
)>;
```

For more details about XCM transport protocols, see the [XCM Channels](/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/){target=\_blank} page.

# Testing and Debugging

## Introduction

Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) is a core feature of the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling communication between parachains, relay chains, and system chains. To ensure the reliability of XCM-powered blockchains, thorough testing and debugging are essential before production deployment.

This guide covers the XCM Emulator, a tool designed to facilitate onboarding and testing for developers. Use the emulator if:

- A live runtime is not yet available
- Extensive configuration adjustments are needed, as emulated chains differ from live networks
- Rust-based tests are preferred for automation and integration

For scenarios where real blockchain state is required, [Chopsticks](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/#xcm-testing){target=\_blank} allows testing with any client compatible with Polkadot SDK-based chains.

## XCM Emulator

Setting up a live network with multiple interconnected parachains for XCM testing can be complex and resource-intensive. 

The [`xcm-emulator`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator){target=\_blank} is a tool designed to simulate the execution of XCM programs using predefined runtime configurations. These configurations include those utilized by live networks like Kusama, Polkadot, and Asset Hub.

This tool enables testing of cross-chain message passing, providing a way to verify outcomes, weights, and side effects efficiently. It achieves this by utilizing mocked runtimes for both the relay chain and connected parachains, enabling developers to focus on message logic and configuration without needing a live network.

The `xcm-emulator` relies on transport layer pallets. However, the messages do not leverage the same messaging infrastructure as live networks since the transport mechanism is mocked. Additionally, consensus-related events are not covered, such as disputes and staking events. Parachains should use end-to-end (E2E) tests to validate these events.

### Advantages and Limitations

The XCM Emulator provides both advantages and limitations when testing cross-chain communication in simulated environments.

- **Advantages**:
    - **Interactive debugging** - offers tracing capabilities similar to EVM, enabling detailed analysis of issues
    - **Runtime composability** - facilitates testing and integration of multiple runtime components
    - **Immediate feedback** - supports Test-Driven Development (TDD) by providing rapid test results
    - **Seamless integration testing** - simplifies the process of testing new runtime versions in an isolated environment

- **Limitations**:
    - **Simplified emulation** - always assumes message delivery, which may not mimic real-world network behavior
    - **Dependency challenges** - requires careful management of dependency versions and patching. Refer to the [Cargo dependency documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html){target=\_blank}
    - **Compilation overhead** - testing environments can be resource-intensive, requiring frequent compilation updates

### How Does It Work?

The `xcm-emulator` provides macros for defining a mocked testing environment. Check all the existing macros and functionality in the [XCM Emulator source code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}. The most important macros are:

- [**`decl_test_relay_chains`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs#L355){target=\_blank} - defines runtime and configuration for the relay chains. Example:

    ```rust
    // Westend declaration
decl_test_relay_chains! {
	#[api_version(11)]
	pub struct Westend {
		genesis = genesis::genesis(),
		on_init = (),
		runtime = westend_runtime,
		core = {
			SovereignAccountOf: westend_runtime::xcm_config::LocationConverter,
		},
		pallets = {
			XcmPallet: westend_runtime::XcmPallet,
			Sudo: westend_runtime::Sudo,
			Balances: westend_runtime::Balances,
			Treasury: westend_runtime::Treasury,
			AssetRate: westend_runtime::AssetRate,
			Hrmp: westend_runtime::Hrmp,
			Identity: westend_runtime::Identity,
			IdentityMigrator: westend_runtime::IdentityMigrator,
		}
	},
}
    ```

- [**`decl_test_parachains`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs#L590){target=\_blank} - defines runtime and configuration for the parachains. Example:

    ```rust
    // AssetHubWestend Parachain declaration
decl_test_parachains! {
	pub struct AssetHubWestend {
		genesis = genesis::genesis(),
		on_init = {
			asset_hub_westend_runtime::AuraExt::on_initialize(1);
		},
		runtime = asset_hub_westend_runtime,
		core = {
			XcmpMessageHandler: asset_hub_westend_runtime::XcmpQueue,
			LocationToAccountId: asset_hub_westend_runtime::xcm_config::LocationToAccountId,
			ParachainInfo: asset_hub_westend_runtime::ParachainInfo,
			MessageOrigin: cumulus_primitives_core::AggregateMessageOrigin,
		},
		pallets = {
			PolkadotXcm: asset_hub_westend_runtime::PolkadotXcm,
			Balances: asset_hub_westend_runtime::Balances,
			Assets: asset_hub_westend_runtime::Assets,
			ForeignAssets: asset_hub_westend_runtime::ForeignAssets,
			PoolAssets: asset_hub_westend_runtime::PoolAssets,
			AssetConversion: asset_hub_westend_runtime::AssetConversion,
		}
	},
}
    ```

- [**`decl_test_bridges`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs#L1178){target=\_blank} - creates bridges between chains, specifying the source, target, and message handler. Example:

    ```rust
    decl_test_bridges! {
	pub struct RococoWestendMockBridge {
		source = BridgeHubRococoPara,
		target = BridgeHubWestendPara,
		handler = RococoWestendMessageHandler
	},
	pub struct WestendRococoMockBridge {
		source = BridgeHubWestendPara,
		target = BridgeHubRococoPara,
		handler = WestendRococoMessageHandler
	}
}
    ```

- [**`decl_test_networks`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs#L916){target=\_blank} - defines a testing network with relay chains, parachains, and bridges, implementing message transport and processing logic. Example:

    ```rust
    decl_test_networks! {
	pub struct WestendMockNet {
		relay_chain = Westend,
		parachains = vec![
			AssetHubWestend,
			BridgeHubWestend,
			CollectivesWestend,
			CoretimeWestend,
			PeopleWestend,
			PenpalA,
			PenpalB,
		],
		bridge = ()
	},
}
    ```

By leveraging these macros, developers can customize their testing networks by defining relay chains and parachains tailored to their needs. For guidance on implementing a mock runtime for a Polkadot SDK-based chain, refer to the [Pallet Testing](/develop/parachains/testing/pallet-testing/){target=\_blank} article. 

This framework enables thorough testing of runtime and cross-chain interactions, enabling developers to effectively design, test, and optimize cross-chain functionality.

To see a complete example of implementing and executing tests, refer to the [integration tests](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus/parachains/integration-tests/emulated){target=\_blank} in the Polkadot SDK repository.

# XCM Channels

## Introduction

Polkadot is designed to enable interoperability between its connected parachains. At the core of this interoperability is the [Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm), a standard language that allows parachains to communicate and interact with each other.

The network-layer protocol responsible for delivering XCM-formatted messages between parachains is the Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP) protocol. XCMP maintains messaging queues on the relay chain, serving as a bridge to facilitate cross-chain interactions.

As XCMP is still under development, Polkadot has implemented a temporary alternative called Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP). HRMP offers the same interface and functionality as the planned XCMP but it has a crucial difference, it stores all messages directly in the relay chain’s storage, which is more resource-intensive.

Once XCMP is fully implemented, HRMP will be deprecated in favor of the native XCMP protocol. XCMP will offer a more efficient and scalable solution for cross-chain message passing, as it will not require the relay chain to store all the messages.

## Establishing HRMP Channels

To enable communication between parachains using the HRMP protocol, the parachains must explicitly establish communication channels by registering them on the relay chain.

Downward and upward channels from and to the relay chain are implicitly available, meaning they do not need to be explicitly opened.

Opening an HRMP channel requires the parachains involved to make a deposit on the relay chain. This deposit serves a specific purpose, it covers the costs associated with using the relay chain's storage for the message queues linked to the channel. The amount of this deposit varies based on parameters defined by the specific relay chain being used.

### Relay Chain Parameters

Each Polkadot relay chain has a set of configurable parameters that control the behavior of the message channels between parachains. These parameters include `hrmpSenderDeposit`, `hrmpRecipientDeposit`, `hrmpChannelMaxMessageSize`, `hrmpChannelMaxCapacity`, and more.

When a parachain wants to open a new channel, it must consider these parameter values to ensure the channel is configured correctly.

To view the current values of these parameters in the Polkadot network:

1. Visit [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer), navigate to the **Developer** dropdown and select the **Chain state** option

    ![](/images/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/xcm-channels-1.webp)

2. Query the chain configuration parameters. The result will display the current settings for all the Polkadot network parameters, including the HRMP channel settings
    1. Select **`configuration`**
    2. Choose the **`activeConfig()`** call
    3. Click the **+** button to execute the query
    4. Check the chain configuration

    ![](/images/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/xcm-channels-2.webp)

### Dispatching Extrinsics

Establishing new HRMP channels between parachains requires dispatching specific extrinsic calls on the Polkadot relay chain from the parachain's origin.

The most straightforward approach is to implement the channel opening logic off-chain, then use the XCM pallet's `send` extrinsic to submit the necessary instructions to the relay chain. However, the ability to send arbitrary programs through the `Transact` instruction in XCM is typically restricted to privileged origins, such as the `sudo` pallet or governance mechanisms.

Parachain developers have a few options for triggering the required extrinsic calls from their parachain's origin, depending on the configuration and access controls defined:

- **Sudo** - if the parachain has a `sudo` pallet configured, the sudo key holder can use the sudo extrinsic to dispatch the necessary channel opening calls
- **Governance** - the parachain's governance system, such as a council or OpenGov, can be used to authorize the channel opening calls
- **Privileged accounts** - the parachain may have other designated privileged accounts that are allowed to dispatch the HRMP channel opening extrinsics

# XCM Config

## Introduction

The [XCM executor](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/index.html){target=\_blank} is a crucial component responsible for interpreting and executing XCM messages (XCMs) with Polkadot SDK-based chains. It processes and manages XCM instructions, ensuring they are executed correctly and in sequentially. Adhering to the [Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM) specification](https://paritytech.github.io/xcm-docs/overview/xcvm.html#the-xcvm){target=\_blank}, the XCM executor can be customized or replaced with an alternative that also complies with the [XCVM standards](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format?tab=readme-ov-file#12-the-xcvm){target=\_blank}.

The `XcmExecutor` is not a pallet but a struct parameterized by a `Config` trait. The `Config` trait is the inner configuration, parameterizing the outer `XcmExecutor<Config>` struct. Both configurations are set up within the runtime.

The executor is highly configurable, with the [XCM builder](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/index.html){target=\_blank} offering building blocks to tailor the configuration to specific needs. While they serve as a foundation, users can easily create custom blocks to suit unique configurations. Users can also create their building blocks to address unique needs. This article examines the XCM configuration process, explains each configurable item, and provides examples of the tools and types available to help customize these settings.

## XCM Executor Configuration

The `Config` trait defines the XCM executor’s configuration, which requires several associated types. Each type has specific trait bounds that the concrete implementation must fulfill. Some types, such as `RuntimeCall`, come with a default implementation in most cases, while others use the unit type `()` as the default. For many of these types, selecting the appropriate implementation carefully is crucial. Predefined solutions and building blocks can be adapted to your specific needs. These solutions can be found in the [`xcm-builder`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/polkadot/xcm/xcm-builder){target=\_blank} folder.

Each type is explained below, along with an overview of some of its implementations:

```rust
pub trait Config {
    type RuntimeCall: Parameter + Dispatchable<PostInfo = PostDispatchInfo> + GetDispatchInfo;
    type XcmSender: SendXcm;
    type AssetTransactor: TransactAsset;
    type OriginConverter: ConvertOrigin<<Self::RuntimeCall as Dispatchable>::RuntimeOrigin>;
    type IsReserve: ContainsPair<MultiAsset, MultiLocation>;
    type IsTeleporter: ContainsPair<MultiAsset, MultiLocation>;
    type Aliasers: ContainsPair<Location, Location>;
    type UniversalLocation: Get<InteriorMultiLocation>;
    type Barrier: ShouldExecute;
    type Weigher: WeightBounds<Self::RuntimeCall>;
    type Trader: WeightTrader;
    type ResponseHandler: OnResponse;
    type AssetTrap: DropAssets;
    type AssetClaims: ClaimAssets;
    type AssetLocker: AssetLock;
    type AssetExchanger: AssetExchange;
    type SubscriptionService: VersionChangeNotifier;
    type PalletInstancesInfo: PalletsInfoAccess;
    type MaxAssetsIntoHolding: Get<u32>;
    type FeeManager: FeeManager;
    type MessageExporter: ExportXcm;
    type UniversalAliases: Contains<(MultiLocation, Junction)>;
    type CallDispatcher: CallDispatcher<Self::RuntimeCall>;
    type SafeCallFilter: Contains<Self::RuntimeCall>;
    type TransactionalProcessor: ProcessTransaction;
    type HrmpNewChannelOpenRequestHandler: HandleHrmpNewChannelOpenRequest;
    type HrmpChannelAcceptedHandler: HandleHrmpChannelAccepted;
    type HrmpChannelClosingHandler: HandleHrmpChannelClosing;
    type XcmRecorder: RecordXcm;
}
```

## Config Items

Each configuration item is explained below, detailing the associated type’s purpose and role in the XCM executor. Many of these types have predefined solutions available in the `xcm-builder`. Therefore, the available configuration items are:

- [**`RuntimeCall`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.RuntimeCall){target=\_blank} - defines the runtime's callable functions, created via the [`frame::runtime`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/attr.runtime.html){target=\_blank} macro. It represents an enum listing the callable functions of all implemented pallets
    ```rust
    type RuntimeCall: Parameter + Dispatchable<PostInfo = PostDispatchInfo> + GetDispatchInfo
    ```
   The associated traits signify:

    - `Parameter` - ensures the type is encodable, decodable, and usable as a parameter
    - `Dispatchable` - indicates it can be executed in the runtime
    - `GetDispatchInfo` - provides weight details, determining how long execution takes

- [**`XcmSender`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmSender){target=\_blank} - implements the [`SendXcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v4/trait.SendXcm.html){target=\_blank} trait, specifying how the executor sends XCMs using transport layers (e.g., UMP for relay chains or XCMP for sibling chains). If a runtime lacks certain transport layers, such as [HRMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport#hrmp-xcmp-lite){target=\_blank} (or [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport#xcmp-cross-consensus-message-passing-design-summary){target=\_blank})
    ```rust
    type XcmSender: SendXcm;
    ```
- [**`AssetTransactor`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.AssetTransactor){target=\_blank} - implements the [`TransactAsset`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/traits/trait.TransactAsset.html){target=\_blank} trait, handling the conversion and transfer of MultiAssets between accounts or registers. It can be configured to support native tokens, fungibles, and non-fungibles or multiple tokens using pre-defined adapters like [`FungibleAdapter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_builder/struct.FungibleAdapter.html){target=\_blank} or custom solutions
    ```rust

FRAME-specific systems often use this, or it can be disabled with `()`
    ```rust
    type PalletInstancesInfo: PalletsInfoAccess;
    ```
 <!-- I think `Holding Register` should be linked to https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/xcm/reference-glossary#holding-register, but since we will have our own glossary, I’m putting this as a TODO -->
- [**`MaxAssetsIntoHolding`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.MaxAssetsIntoHolding){target=\_blank} - limits the number of assets in the [Holding register](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/xcm/reference-glossary#holding-register){target=\_blank}. At most, twice this limit can be held under worst-case conditions
    ```rust
    type MaxAssetsIntoHolding: Get<u32>;

Fees can be waived entirely using `()`
    ```rust
    type FeeManager: FeeManager;
    ```

- [**`MessageExporter`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.MessageExporter){target=\_blank} - implements the [`ExportXcm`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/traits/trait.ExportXcm.html){target=\_blank} trait, enabling XCMs export to other consensus systems.

    ```

- [**`SafeCallFilter`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.SafeCallFilter){target=\_blank} - whitelists calls permitted in the `Transact` instruction. Using `Everything` allows all calls, though this is temporary until proof size weights are accounted for
    ```rust
    type SafeCallFilter: Contains<Self::RuntimeCall>;
    ```

- [**`TransactionalProcessor`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.TransactionalProcessor){target=\_blank} - implements the [`ProccessTransaction`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/traits/trait.ProcessTransaction.html){target=\_blank} trait. It ensures that XCM instructions are executed atomically, meaning they either fully succeed or fully fail without any partial effects. This type allows for non-transactional XCM instruction processing by setting the `()` type
    ```rust
    type TransactionalProcessor: ProcessTransaction;
    ```

- [**`HrmpNewChannelOpenRequestHandler`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.HrmpNewChannelOpenRequestHandler){target=\_blank} - enables optional logic execution in response to the `HrmpNewChannelOpenRequest` XCM notification

    ```
- [**`XcmRecorder`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.XcmRecorder){target=\_blank} - allows tracking of the most recently executed XCM, primarily for use with dry-run runtime APIs
    ```rust
    type XcmRecorder: RecordXcm;
    ```

### Inner Config

The `Config` trait underpins the `XcmExecutor`, defining its core behavior through associated types for asset handling, XCM processing, and permission management. These types are categorized as follows:

- **Handlers** - manage XCMs sending, asset transactions, and special notifications
- **Filters** - define trusted combinations, origin substitutions, and execution barriers
- **Converters** - handle origin conversion for call execution
- **Accessors** - provide weight determination and pallet information
- **Constants** - specify universal locations and asset limits
- **Common Configs** - include shared settings like `RuntimeCall`

The following diagram outlines this categorization:

```mermaid

    A[Inner Config] --> B[Handlers]
    A --> C[Filters]

    E --> AE[PalletInstancesInfo]

    F --> AF[UniversalLocation]
    F --> AG[MaxAssetsIntoHolding]

    G --> AH[RuntimeCall]
```

### Outer Config

The `XcmExecutor<Config>` struct extends the functionality of the inner config by introducing fields for execution context, asset handling, error tracking, and operational management. For further details, see the documentation for [`XcmExecutor<Config>`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm_executor/struct.XcmExecutor.html#impl-XcmExecutor%3CConfig%3E){target=\_blank}.

## Multiple Implementations

Some associated types in the `Config` trait are highly configurable and may have multiple implementations (e.g., Barrier). These implementations are organized into a tuple `(impl_1, impl_2, ..., impl_n)`, and the execution follows a sequential order. Each item in the tuple is evaluated individually, each being checked to see if it fails. If an item passes (e.g., returns `Ok` or `true`), the execution stops, and the remaining items are not evaluated. The following example of the `Barrier` type demonstrates how this grouping operates (understanding each item in the tuple is unnecessary for this explanation).

In the following example, the system will first check the `TakeWeightCredit` type when evaluating the barrier. If it fails, it will check `AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom`, and so on, until one of them returns a positive result. If all checks fail, a Barrier error will be triggered.

```rust
pub type Barrier = (
    TakeWeightCredit,
    AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom<Everything>,
    AllowKnownQueryResponses<XcmPallet>,
    AllowSubscriptionsFrom<Everything>,
);

pub struct XcmConfig;
impl xcm_executor::Config for XcmConfig {
    ...
    type Barrier = Barrier;
    ...
}
```

# XCM Runtime APIs

## Introduction

Runtime APIs allow node-side code to extract information from the runtime state. While simple storage access retrieves stored values directly, runtime APIs enable arbitrary computation, making them a powerful tool for interacting with the chain's state.

Unlike direct storage access, runtime APIs can derive values from storage based on arguments or perform computations that don't require storage access. For example, a runtime API might expose a formula for fee calculation, using only the provided arguments as inputs rather than fetching data from storage.

In general, runtime APIs are used for:

- Accessing a storage item
- Retrieving a bundle of related storage items
- Deriving a value from storage based on arguments
- Exposing formulas for complex computational calculations

This section will teach you about specific runtime APIs that support XCM processing and manipulation.

## Dry Run API

The [Dry-run API](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/xcm_runtime_apis/dry_run/trait.DryRunApi.html){target=\_blank}, given an extrinsic, or an XCM program, returns its effects:

- Execution result
- Local XCM (in the case of an extrinsic)
- Forwarded XCMs
- List of events

This API can be used independently for dry-running, double-checking, or testing. However, it mainly shines when used with the [Xcm Payment API](#xcm-payment-api), given that it only estimates fees if you know the specific XCM you want to execute or send.

### Dry Run Call

This API allows a dry-run of any extrinsic and obtaining the outcome if it fails or succeeds, as well as the local xcm and remote xcm messages sent to other chains.

```rust
/// Dry run call V2.
```

??? interface "Input parameters"

    `origin` ++"OriginCaller"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>
    
    The origin used for executing the transaction.

    ---

    `call` ++"Call"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    The extrinsic to be executed.

    ---

??? interface "Output parameters"

    ++"Result<CallDryRunEffects<Event>, Error>"++

    Effects of dry-running an extrinsic. If an error occurs, it is returned instead of the effects.

    ??? child "Type `CallDryRunEffects<Event>`"

        `execution_result` ++"DispatchResultWithPostInfo"++

        The result of executing the extrinsic.

        ---

        `emitted_events` ++"Vec<Event>"++

        The list of events fired by the extrinsic.

        ---

        `local_xcm` ++"Option<VersionedXcm<()>>"++

        The local XCM that was attempted to be executed, if any.

        ---

        `forwarded_xcms` ++"Vec<(VersionedLocation, Vec<VersionedXcm<()>>)>"++

        The list of XCMs that were queued for sending.

    ??? child "Type `Error`"

        Enum:

        - **`Unimplemented`** - an API part is unsupported
        - **`VersionedConversionFailed`** - converting a versioned data structure from one version to another failed

    ---

??? interface "Example"

    This example demonstrates how to simulate a cross-chain asset transfer from the Paseo network to the Pop Network using a [reserve transfer](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/xcm/journey/transfers-reserve){target=\_blank} mechanism. Instead of executing the actual transfer, the code shows how to test and verify the transaction's behavior through a dry run before performing it on the live network.

    Replace `INSERT_USER_ADDRESS` with your SS58 address before running the script.

    ***Usage with PAPI***

    ```js

    },
  ]),
  fee_asset_item: 0, // Asset used to pay transaction fees
  weight_limit: XcmV3WeightLimit.Unlimited(), // No weight limit on transaction
});

// Execute the dry run call to simulate the transaction
const dryRunResult = await paseoApi.apis.DryRunApi.dry_run_call(

// Extract the data from the dry run result
const {
  execution_result: executionResult,
  emitted_events: emmittedEvents,
  local_xcm: localXcm,
  forwarded_xcms: forwardedXcms,
} = dryRunResult.value;

// Extract the XCM generated by this call
const xcmsToPop = forwardedXcms.find(

    location.type === 'V4' &&
    location.value.parents === 0 &&
    location.value.interior.type === 'X1' &&
    location.value.interior.value.type === 'Parachain' &&
    location.value.interior.value.value === popParaID, // Pop network's ParaID

## XCM Payment API

The [XCM Payment API](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/xcm_runtime_apis/fees/trait.XcmPaymentApi.html){target=\_blank} provides a standardized way to determine the costs and payment options for executing XCM messages. Specifically, it enables clients to:

- Retrieve the [weight](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight) required to execute an XCM message
- Obtain a list of acceptable `AssetIds` for paying execution fees
- Calculate the cost of the weight in a specified `AssetId`
- Estimate the fees for XCM message delivery

This API eliminates the need for clients to guess execution fees or identify acceptable assets manually. Instead, clients can query the list of supported asset IDs formatted according to the XCM version they understand. With this information, they can weigh the XCM program they intend to execute and convert the computed weight into its cost using one of the acceptable assets.

To use the API effectively, the client must already know the XCM program to be executed and the chains involved in the program's execution.

### Query Acceptable Payment Assets

Retrieves the list of assets that are acceptable for paying fees when using a specific XCM version

```rust
fn query_acceptable_payment_assets(xcm_version: Version) -> Result<Vec<VersionedAssetId>, Error>;
```

??? interface "Input parameters"

    `xcm_version` ++"Version"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    Specifies the XCM version that will be used to send the XCM message.

    ---

??? interface "Output parameters"

    ++"Result<Vec<VersionedAssetId>, Error>"++

    A list of acceptable payment assets. Each asset is provided in a versioned format (`VersionedAssetId`) that matches the specified XCM version. If an error occurs, it is returned instead of the asset list.

    ??? child "Type `Error`"

        Enum:

        - **`Unimplemented`** - an API part is unsupported
        - **`VersionedConversionFailed`** - converting a versioned data structure from one version to another failed
        - **`WeightNotComputable`** - XCM message weight calculation failed
        - **`UnhandledXcmVersion`** - XCM version not able to be handled
        - **`AssetNotFound`** - the given asset is not handled as a fee asset
        - **`Unroutable`** - destination is known to be unroutable

    ---

??? interface "Example"

    This example demonstrates how to query the acceptable payment assets for executing XCM messages on the Paseo Asset Hub network using XCM version 3.

    ***Usage with PAPI***

    ```js
    import { paseoAssetHub } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider/web';
import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';

// Connect to the polkadot relay chain
const client = createClient(
  withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('wss://asset-hub-paseo-rpc.dwellir.com')),
);

const paseoAssetHubApi = client.getTypedApi(paseoAssetHub);

// Define the xcm version to use
const xcmVersion = 3;

// Execute the runtime call to query the assets
const result =
  await paseoAssetHubApi.apis.XcmPaymentApi.query_acceptable_payment_assets(
    xcmVersion,
  );

// Print the assets
console.dir(result.value, { depth: null });

client.destroy();
    ```

    ***Output***

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <pre>
    [
      {
        type: 'V3',
        value: {
          type: 'Concrete',
          value: { parents: 1, interior: { type: 'Here', value: undefined } }
        }
      }
    ]
  </pre>
</div>

### Query XCM Weight

Calculates the weight required to execute a given XCM message. It is useful for estimating the execution cost of a cross-chain message in the destination chain before sending it.

```rust
fn query_xcm_weight(message: VersionedXcm<()>) -> Result<Weight, Error>;
```

??? interface "Input parameters"

    `message` ++"VersionedXcm<()>"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>
    
    A versioned XCM message whose execution weight is being queried.

    ---

??? interface "Output parameters"

    ++"Result<Weight, Error>"++
    
    The calculated weight required to execute the provided XCM message. If the calculation fails, an error is returned instead.

    ??? child "Type `Weight`"

        `ref_time` ++"u64"++

        The weight of computational time used based on some reference hardware.

        ---

        `proof_size` ++"u64"++

        The weight of storage space used by proof of validity.

        ---

    ??? child "Type `Error`"

        Enum:

        - **`Unimplemented`** - an API part is unsupported
        - **`VersionedConversionFailed`** - converting a versioned data structure from one version to another failed
        - **`WeightNotComputable`** - XCM message weight calculation failed
        - **`UnhandledXcmVersion`** - XCM version not able to be handled
        - **`AssetNotFound`** - the given asset is not handled as a fee asset
        - **`Unroutable`** - destination is known to be unroutable

    ---

??? interface "Example"

    This example demonstrates how to calculate the weight needed to execute a [teleport transfer](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/xcm/journey/transfers-teleport){target=\_blank} from the Paseo network to the Paseo Asset Hub parachain using the XCM Payment API. The result shows the required weight in terms of reference time and proof size needed in the destination chain.

    Replace `INSERT_USER_ADDRESS` with your SS58 address before running the script.

    This example demonstrates how to calculate the fee for a given execution weight using a specific versioned asset ID (PAS token) on Paseo Asset Hub.

    ***Usage with PAPI***

    ```js
    import { paseoAssetHub } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider/web';
import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';

// Connect to the polkadot relay chain
const client = createClient(
  withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('wss://asset-hub-paseo-rpc.dwellir.com')),
);

const paseoAssetHubApi = client.getTypedApi(paseoAssetHub);

// Define the weight to convert to fee
const weight = { ref_time: 15574200000n, proof_size: 359300n };

// Define the versioned asset id
const versionedAssetId = {
  type: 'V4',
  value: { parents: 1, interior: { type: 'Here', value: undefined } },
};

// Execute the runtime call to convert the weight to fee
const result =
  await paseoAssetHubApi.apis.XcmPaymentApi.query_weight_to_asset_fee(
    weight,
    versionedAssetId,
  );

// Print the fee
console.dir(result.value, { depth: null });

client.destroy();
    ```

    ***Output***

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty>1796500000n</span>
</div>

### Query Delivery Fees

Retrieves the delivery fees for sending a specific XCM message to a designated destination. The fees are always returned in a specific asset defined by the destination chain.

```rust
fn query_delivery_fees(destination: VersionedLocation, message: VersionedXcm<()>) -> Result<VersionedAssets, Error>;
```

??? interface "Input parameters"

    `destination` ++"VersionedLocation"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>
    
    The target location where the message will be sent. Fees may vary depending on the destination, as different destinations often have unique fee structures and sender mechanisms.

    ---

    `message` ++"VersionedXcm<()>"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>
    
    The XCM message to be sent. The delivery fees are calculated based on the message's content and size, which can influence the cost.

    ---

??? interface "Output parameters"

    ++"Result<VersionedAssets, Error>"++
    
    The calculated delivery fees expressed in a specific asset supported by the destination chain. If an error occurs during the query, it returns an error instead.

    ??? child "Type `Error`"

        Enum:

        - **`Unimplemented`** - an API part is unsupported
        - **`VersionedConversionFailed`** - converting a versioned data structure from one version to another failed
        - **`WeightNotComputable`** - XCM message weight calculation failed
        - **`UnhandledXcmVersion`** - XCM version not able to be handled
        - **`AssetNotFound`** - the given asset is not handled as a fee asset
        - **`Unroutable`** - destination is known to be unroutable

    ---

??? interface "Example"

    This example demonstrates how to query the delivery fees for sending an XCM message from Paseo to Paseo Asset Hub.

    Replace `INSERT_USER_ADDRESS` with your SS58 address before running the script.

# Networks

## Introduction

The Polkadot ecosystem consists of multiple networks designed to support different stages of blockchain development, from main networks to test networks. Each network serves a unique purpose, providing developers with flexible environments for building, testing, and deploying blockchain applications.

This section includes essential network information such as RPC endpoints, currency symbols and decimals, and how to acquire TestNet tokens for the Polkadot ecosystem of networks.

## Production Networks

### Polkadot

Polkadot is the primary production blockchain network for high-stakes, enterprise-grade applications. Polkadot MainNet has been running since May 2020 and has implementations in various programming languages ranging from Rust to JavaScript.

### Kusama

Kusama is a network built as a risk-taking, fast-moving "canary in the coal mine" for its cousin Polkadot. As it is built on top of the same infrastructure, Kusama often acts as a final testing ground for new features before they are launched on Polkadot. Unlike true TestNets, however, the Kusama KSM native token does have economic value. This incentive encourages paricipants to maintain this robust and performant structure for the benefit of the community.

## Test Networks

### Westend

Westend is the primary test network that mirrors Polkadot's functionality for protocol-level feature development. As a true TestNet, the WND native token intentionally does not have any economic value. Use the faucet information in the following section to obtain WND tokens.

---

# Add a Pallet to the Runtime

## Introduction

The [Polkadot SDK Solochain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-solochain-template){target=\_blank} provides a functional runtime that includes default FRAME development modules (pallets) to help you get started with building a custom blockchain.

Each pallet has specific configuration requirements, such as the parameters and types needed to enable the pallet's functionality. In this guide, you'll learn how to add a pallet to a runtime and configure the settings specific to that pallet.

The purpose of this article is to help you:

- Learn how to update runtime dependencies to integrate a new pallet
- Understand how to configure pallet-specific Rust traits to enable the pallet's functionality
- Grasp the entire workflow of integrating a new pallet into your runtime

## Configuring Runtime Dependencies

For Rust programs, this configuration is defined in the `Cargo.toml` file, which specifies the settings and dependencies that control what gets compiled into the final binary. Since the Polkadot SDK runtime compiles to both a native binary (which includes standard Rust library functions) and a Wasm binary (which does not include the standard Rust library), the `runtime/Cargo.toml` file manages two key aspects:

- The locations and versions of the pallets that are to be imported as dependencies for the runtime
- The features in each pallet that should be enabled when compiling the native Rust binary. By enabling the standard (`std`) feature set from each pallet, you ensure that the runtime includes the functions, types, and primitives necessary for the native build, which are otherwise excluded when compiling the Wasm binary


For information about adding dependencies in `Cargo.toml` files, see the [Dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/dependencies.html){target=\_blank} page in the Cargo documentation. To learn more about enabling and managing features from dependent packages, see the [Features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html){target=\_blank} section in the Cargo documentation.

## Dependencies for a New Pallet

To add the dependencies for a new pallet to the runtime, you must modify the `Cargo.toml` file by adding a new line into the `[workspace.dependencies]` section with the pallet you want to add. This pallet definition might look like:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
pallet-example = { version = "4.0.0-dev", default-features = false }
```

This line imports the `pallet-example` crate as a dependency and specifies the following:

- **`version`** - the specific version of the crate to import
- **`default-features`** - determines the behavior for including pallet features when compiling the runtime with standard Rust libraries

!!! tip
    If you're importing a pallet that isn't available on [`crates.io`](https://crates.io/){target=\_blank}, you can specify the pallet's location (either locally or from a remote repository) by using the `git` or `path` key. For example:

    ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
    pallet-example = { 
        version = "4.0.0-dev",
        default-features = false,
        git = "INSERT_PALLET_REMOTE_URL",
    }
    ```

    In this case, replace `INSERT_PALLET_REMOTE_URL` with the correct repository URL. For local paths, use the path key like so:

    ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
    pallet-example = { 
        version = "4.0.0-dev",
        default-features = false,
        path = "INSERT_PALLET_RELATIVE_PATH",
    }
    ```

    Ensure that you substitute `INSERT_PALLET_RELATIVE_PATH` with the appropriate local path to the pallet.

Next, add this dependency to the `[dependencies]` section of the `runtime/Cargo.toml` file, so it inherits from the main `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml title="runtime/Cargo.toml"
pallet-examples.workspace = true
```

To enable the `std` feature of the pallet, add the pallet to the following section:

```toml title="runtime/Cargo.toml"
[features]
default = ["std"]
std = [
    ...
    "pallet-example/std",
    ...
]
```

This section specifies the default feature set for the runtime, which includes the `std` features for each pallet. When the runtime is compiled with the `std` feature set, the standard library features for all listed pallets are enabled. If you forget to update the features section in the `Cargo.toml` file, you might encounter `cannot find function` errors when compiling the runtime.

For more details about how the runtime is compiled as both a native binary (using `std`) and a Wasm binary (using `no_std`), refer to the [Wasm build](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/substrate/index.html#wasm-build){target=\_blank} section in the Polkadot SDK documentation.

To ensure that the new dependencies resolve correctly for the runtime, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo check --release
```

## Config Trait for Pallets

Every Polkadot SDK pallet defines a Rust trait called `Config`. This trait specifies the types and parameters that the pallet needs to integrate with the runtime and perform its functions. The primary purpose of this trait is to act as an interface between this pallet and the runtime in which it is embedded. A type, function, or constant in this trait is essentially left to be configured by the runtime that includes this pallet.

Consequently, a runtime that wants to include this pallet must implement this trait.

You can inspect any pallet’s `Config` trait by reviewing its Rust documentation or source code. The `Config` trait ensures the pallet has access to the necessary types (like events, calls, or origins) and integrates smoothly with the rest of the runtime.

At its core, the `Config` trait typically looks like this:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    /// Event type used by the pallet.
    type RuntimeEvent: From<Event> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

    /// Weight information for controlling extrinsic execution costs.
    type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
}
```

This basic structure shows that every pallet must define certain types, such as `RuntimeEvent` and `WeightInfo`, to function within the runtime. The actual implementation can vary depending on the pallet’s specific needs.

### Utility Pallet Example

For instance, in the [`utility`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame/utility){target=\_blank} pallet, the `Config` trait is implemented with the following types:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    /// The overarching event type.
    type RuntimeEvent: From<Event> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

    /// The overarching call type.
    type RuntimeCall: Parameter
    + Dispatchable<RuntimeOrigin = Self::RuntimeOrigin, PostInfo = PostDispatchInfo>
    + GetDispatchInfo
    + From<frame_system::Call<Self>>
    + UnfilteredDispatchable<RuntimeOrigin = Self::RuntimeOrigin>
    + IsSubType<Call<Self>>
    + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeCall>;

    /// The caller origin, overarching type of all pallets origins.
    type PalletsOrigin: Parameter +
    Into<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeOrigin> +
    IsType<<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeOrigin as frame_support::traits::OriginTrait>::PalletsOrigin>;

    /// Weight information for extrinsics in this pallet.
    type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
}
```

This example shows how the `Config` trait defines types like `RuntimeEvent`, `RuntimeCall`, `PalletsOrigin`, and `WeightInfo`, which the pallet will use when interacting with the runtime.

## Parameter Configuration for Pallets

Traits in Rust define shared behavior, and within the Polkadot SDK, they allow runtimes to integrate and utilize a pallet's functionality by implementing its associated configuration trait and parameters. Some of these parameters may require constant values, which can be defined using the [`parameter_types!`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/macro.parameter_types.html){target=\_blank} macro. This macro simplifies development by expanding the constants into the appropriate struct types with functions that the runtime can use to access their types and values in a consistent manner.

For example, the following code snippet shows how the solochain template configures certain parameters through the [`parameter_types!`]({{ dependencies.polkadot_sdk_solochain_template.repository_url }}/blob/v0.0.2/runtime/src/lib.rs#L138){target=\_blank} macro in the `runtime/lib.rs` file:

```rust
parameter_types! {
    pub const BlockHashCount: BlockNumber = 2400;
    pub const Version: RuntimeVersion = VERSION;
    /// We allow for 2 seconds of compute with a 6 second average block time.
    pub BlockWeights: frame_system::limits::BlockWeights =
        frame_system::limits::BlockWeights::with_sensible_defaults(
            Weight::from_parts(2u64 * WEIGHT_REF_TIME_PER_SECOND, u64::MAX),
            NORMAL_DISPATCH_RATIO,
        );
    pub BlockLength: frame_system::limits::BlockLength = frame_system::limits::BlockLength
        ::max_with_normal_ratio(5 * 1024 * 1024, NORMAL_DISPATCH_RATIO);
    pub const SS58Prefix: u8 = 42;
}
```

## Pallet Config in the Runtime

To integrate a new pallet into the runtime, you must implement its `Config` trait in the `runtime/lib.rs` file. This is done by specifying the necessary types and parameters in Rust, as shown below:

```rust
impl pallet_example::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type WeightInfo = pallet_template::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
    ...
}
```

Finally, to compose the runtime, update the list of pallets in the same file by modifying the [`#[frame_support::runtime]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/attr.runtime.html){target=\_blank} section. This Rust macro constructs the runtime with your specified name and pallets, wraps the runtime's configuration, and automatically generates boilerplate code for pallet inclusion. 

Use the following format when adding your pallet:

# Add Smart Contract Functionality

## Introduction

When building your custom blockchain with the Polkadot SDK, you have the flexibility to add smart contract capabilities through specialized pallets. These pallets allow blockchain users to deploy and execute smart contracts, enhancing your chain's functionality and programmability.

Polkadot SDK-based blockchains support two distinct smart contract execution environments: [EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)](#evm-smart-contracts) and [Wasm (WebAssembly)](#wasm-smart-contracts). Each environment allows developers to deploy and execute different types of smart contracts, providing flexibility in choosing the most suitable solution for their needs.

## EVM Smart Contracts

To enable Ethereum-compatible smart contracts in your blockchain, you'll need to integrate [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank}, the Ethereum compatibility layer for Polkadot SDK-based chains. This requires adding two essential pallets to your runtime:

- [**`pallet-evm`**](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm){target=\_blank} - provides the EVM execution environment
- [**`pallet-ethereum`**](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/ethereum){target=\_blank} - handles Ethereum-formatted transactions and RPC capabilities

For step-by-step guidance on adding these pallets to your runtime, refer to [Add a Pallet to the Runtime](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/add-existing-pallets/){target=\_blank}.

For a real-world example of how these pallets are implemented in production, you can check Moonbeam's implementation of [`pallet-evm`](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/9e2ddbc9ae8bf65f11701e7ccde50075e5fe2790/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs#L532){target=\_blank} and [`pallet-ethereum`](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/9e2ddbc9ae8bf65f11701e7ccde50075e5fe2790/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs#L698){target=\_blank}.

## Wasm Smart Contracts

To support Wasm-based smart contracts, you'll need to integrate:

- [**`pallet-contracts`**](https://docs.rs/pallet-contracts/latest/pallet_contracts/index.html#contracts-pallet){target=\_blank} - provides the Wasm smart contract execution environment

This pallet enables the deployment and execution of Wasm-based smart contracts on your blockchain. For detailed instructions on adding this pallet to your runtime, see [Add a Pallet to the Runtime](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/add-existing-pallets/){target=\_blank}.

For a real-world example of how this pallet is implemented in production, you can check Astar's implementation of [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/blob/b6f7a408d31377130c3713ed52941a06b5436402/runtime/astar/src/lib.rs#L693){target=\_blank}.

# Customize Your Parachain

Learn how to build a custom parachain with Polkadot SDK's FRAME framework, which includes pallet development, testing, smart contracts, and runtime customization. Pallets are modular components within the FRAME ecosystem that contain specific blockchain functionalities. This modularity grants developers increased flexibility and control around which behaviors to include in the core logic of their parachain.

The [FRAME directory](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame){target=\_blank} includes a robust library of pre-built pallets you can use as examples or templates to ease development.

description: Learn how to create custom pallets using FRAME, allowing for flexible, modular, and scalable blockchain development. Follow the step-by-step guide.

# Make a Custom Pallet

## Introduction

FRAME provides a powerful set of tools for blockchain development, including a library of pre-built pallets. However, its true strength lies in the ability to create custom pallets tailored to your specific needs. This section will guide you through creating your own custom pallet, allowing you to extend your blockchain's functionality in unique ways.

To get the most out of this guide, ensure you're familiar with [FRAME concepts](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/overview/){target=\_blank}.

Creating custom pallets offers several advantages over relying on pre-built pallets:

- **Flexibility** - define runtime behavior that precisely matches your project requirements
- **Modularity** - combine pre-built and custom pallets to achieve the desired blockchain functionality
- **Scalability** - add or modify features as your project evolves

As you follow this guide to create your custom pallet, you'll work with the following key sections:

1. **Imports and dependencies** - bring in necessary FRAME libraries and external modules
2. **Runtime configuration trait** - specify the types and constants required for your pallet to interact with the runtime
3. **Runtime events** - define events that your pallet can emit to communicate state changes
4. **Runtime errors** - define the error types that can be returned from the function calls dispatched to the runtime
5. **Runtime storage** - declare on-chain storage items for your pallet's state
6. **Extrinsics (function calls)** - create callable functions that allow users to interact with your pallet and execute transactions

For additional macros you can include in a pallet, beyond those covered in this guide, refer to the [pallet_macros](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/index.html){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot SDK Docs.

## Initial Setup

This section will guide you through the initial steps of creating the foundation for your custom FRAME pallet. You'll create a new Rust library project and set up the necessary dependencies.

1. Create a new Rust library project using the following `cargo` command:

    ```bash
    cargo new --lib custom-pallet \
    && cd custom-pallet
    ```

    This command creates a new library project named `custom-pallet` and navigates into its directory.

2.  Configure the dependencies required for FRAME pallet development in the `Cargo.toml` file as follows:

    ```toml
    [package]
name = "custom-pallet"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
frame-support = { version = "37.0.0", default-features = false }
frame-system = { version = "37.0.0", default-features = false }
codec = { version = "3.6.12", default-features = false, package = "parity-scale-codec", features = [
  "derive",
] }
scale-info = { version = "2.11.1", default-features = false, features = [
  "derive",
] }
sp-runtime = { version = "39.0.0", default-features = false }

[features]
default = ["std"]
std = [
  "frame-support/std",
  "frame-system/std",
  "codec/std",
  "scale-info/std",
  "sp-runtime/std",
]
    ```

    !!!note
        Proper version management is crucial for ensuring compatibility and reducing potential conflicts in your project. Carefully select the versions of the packages according to your project's specific requirements:

        - When developing for a specific Polkadot SDK runtime, ensure that your pallet's dependency versions match those of the target runtime
        - If you're creating this pallet within a Polkadot SDK workspace:

            - Define the actual versions in the root `Cargo.toml` file
            - Use workspace inheritance in your pallet's `Cargo.toml` to maintain consistency across your project
        - Regularly check for updates to FRAME and Polkadot SDK dependencies to benefit from the latest features, performance improvements, and security patches

    For detailed information about workspace inheritance and how to properly integrate your pallet with the runtime, see the [Add an Existing Pallet to the Runtime](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/add-existing-pallets/){target=\_blank} page.

3.  Initialize the pallet structure by replacing the contents of `src/lib.rs` with the following scaffold code:

    ```rust
    pub use pallet::*;

#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
    use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
    use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

    #[pallet::pallet]
    pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

    #[pallet::config]  // snip
    #[pallet::event]   // snip
    #[pallet::error]   // snip
    #[pallet::storage] // snip
    #[pallet::call]    // snip
}
    ```

    With this scaffold in place, you're ready to start implementing your custom pallet's specific logic and features. The subsequent sections of this guide will walk you through populating each of these components with the necessary code for your pallet's functionality.

## Pallet Configuration

Every pallet includes a Rust trait called [`Config`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/trait.Config.html){target=\_blank}, which exposes configurable options and links your pallet to other parts of the runtime. All types and constants the pallet depends on must be declared within this trait. These types are defined generically and made concrete when the pallet is instantiated in the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file of your blockchain.

In this step, you'll only configure the common types used by all pallets:

- **`RuntimeEvent`** - since this pallet emits events, the runtime event type is required to handle them. This ensures that events generated by the pallet can be correctly processed and interpreted by the runtime
- **`WeightInfo`** - this type defines the weights associated with the pallet's callable functions (also known as dispatchables). Weights help measure the computational cost of executing these functions. However, the `WeightInfo` type will be left unconfigured since setting up custom weights is outside the scope of this guide

Replace the line containing the [`#[pallet::config]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.config.html){target=\_blank} macro with the following code block:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    /// The overarching runtime event type.
    type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;
    /// A type representing the weights required by the dispatchables of this pallet.
    type WeightInfo;
}
```

## Pallet Events

After configuring the pallet to emit events, the next step is to define the events that can be triggered by functions within the pallet. Events provide a straightforward way to inform external entities, such as dApps, chain explorers, or users, that a significant change has occurred in the runtime. In a FRAME pallet, the details of each event and its parameters are included in the node’s metadata, making them accessible to external tools and interfaces.

The [`generate_deposit`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.generate_deposit.html){target=\_blank} macro generates a `deposit_event` function on the `Pallet`, which converts the pallet’s event type into the [`RuntimeEvent`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.RuntimeEvent){target=\_blank} (as specified in the `Config` trait) and deposits it using [`frame_system::Pallet::deposit_event`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.deposit_event){target=\_blank}.

This step adds an event called `SomethingStored`, which is triggered when a user successfully stores a value in the pallet. The event records both the value and the account that performed the action.

To define events, replace the [`#[pallet::event]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.event.html){target=\_blank} line with the following code block:

```rust
#[pallet::event]
#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
pub enum Event<T: Config> {
    /// A user has successfully set a new value.
    SomethingStored {
        /// The new value set.
        something: u32,
        /// The account who set the new value.
        who: T::AccountId,
    },
}
```

## Pallet Errors

While events signal the successful completion of calls, errors indicate when and why a call has failed. It's essential to use informative names for errors to clearly communicate the cause of failure. Like events, error documentation is included in the node's metadata, so providing helpful descriptions is crucial.

Errors are defined as an enum named `Error` with a generic type. Variants can have fields or be fieldless. Any field type specified in the error must implement the [`TypeInfo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_prelude/trait.TypeInfo.html){target=\_blank} trait, and the encoded size of each field should be as small as possible. Runtime errors can be up to 4 bytes in size, allowing the return of additional information when needed.

This step defines two basic errors: one for handling cases where no value has been set and another for managing arithmetic overflow.

To define errors, replace the [`#[pallet::error]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.error.html){target=\_blank} line with the following code block:

```rust
#[pallet::error]
pub enum Error<T> {
    /// The value retrieved was `None` as no value was previously set.
    NoneValue,
    /// There was an attempt to increment the value in storage over `u32::MAX`.
    StorageOverflow,
}
```

## Pallet Storage

To persist and store state/data within the pallet (and subsequently, the blockchain you are building), the `#[pallet::storage]` macro is used. This macro allows the definition of abstract storage within the runtime and sets metadata for that storage. It can be applied multiple times to define different storage items. Several types are available for defining storage, which you can explore in the [Polkadot SDK documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/storage/types/index.html){target=\_blank}.

This step adds a simple storage item, `Something`, which stores a single `u32` value in the pallet's runtime storage

To define storage, replace the [`#[pallet::storage]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.storage.html){target=\_blank} line with the following code block:

```rust
#[pallet::storage]
pub type Something<T> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
```

## Pallet Dispatchable Extrinsics

Dispatchable functions enable users to interact with the pallet and trigger state changes. These functions are represented as "extrinsics," which are similar to transactions. They must return a [`DispatchResult`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/dispatch/type.DispatchResult.html){target=\_blank} and be annotated with a weight and a call index.

The `#[pallet::call_index]` macro is used to explicitly define an index for calls in the `Call` enum. This is useful for maintaining backward compatibility in the event of new dispatchables being introduced, as changing the order of dispatchables would otherwise alter their index.

The `#[pallet::weight]` macro assigns a weight to each call, determining its execution cost.

This section adds two dispatchable functions:

- **`do_something`** - takes a single `u32` value, stores it in the pallet's storage, and emits an event
- **`cause_error`** - checks if a value exists in storage. If the value is found, it increments and is stored back. If no value is present or an overflow occurs, a custom error is returned

To implement these calls, replace the [`#[pallet::call]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.call.html){target=\_blank} line with the following code block:

```rust
#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
    #[pallet::call_index(0)]
    #[pallet::weight(Weight::default())]
    pub fn do_something(origin: OriginFor<T>, something: u32) -> DispatchResult {
        // Check that the extrinsic was signed and get the signer.
        let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;

        // Update storage.
        Something::<T>::put(something);

        // Emit an event.
        Self::deposit_event(Event::SomethingStored { something, who });

        // Return a successful `DispatchResult`
        Ok(())
    }

    #[pallet::call_index(1)]
    #[pallet::weight(Weight::default())]
    pub fn cause_error(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResult {
        let _who = ensure_signed(origin)?;

        // Read a value from storage.
        match Something::<T>::get() {
            // Return an error if the value has not been set.
            None => Err(Error::<T>::NoneValue.into()),
            Some(old) => {
                // Increment the value read from storage. This will cause an error in the event
                // of overflow.
                let new = old.checked_add(1).ok_or(Error::<T>::StorageOverflow)?;
                // Update the value in storage with the incremented result.
                Something::<T>::put(new);
                Ok(())
            },
        }
    }
}
```

## Pallet Implementation Overview

After following all the previous steps, the pallet is now fully implemented. Below is the complete code, combining the configuration, events, errors, storage, and dispatchable functions:

???code
    ```rust
    pub use pallet::*;

#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
    use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
    use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

    #[pallet::pallet]
    pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

    #[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        /// The overarching runtime event type.
        type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;
        /// A type representing the weights required by the dispatchables of this pallet.
        type WeightInfo;
    }

    #[pallet::event]
    #[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
    pub enum Event<T: Config> {
        /// A user has successfully set a new value.
        SomethingStored {
            /// The new value set.
            something: u32,
            /// The account who set the new value.
            who: T::AccountId,
        },
    }
    
    #[pallet::error]
    pub enum Error<T> {
        /// The value retrieved was `None` as no value was previously set.
        NoneValue,
        /// There was an attempt to increment the value in storage over `u32::MAX`.
        StorageOverflow,
    }

    #[pallet::storage]
    pub type Something<T> = StorageValue<_, u32>;

    #[pallet::call]
    impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
        #[pallet::call_index(0)]
        #[pallet::weight(Weight::default())]
        pub fn do_something(origin: OriginFor<T>, something: u32) -> DispatchResult {
            // Check that the extrinsic was signed and get the signer.
            let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    
            // Update storage.
            Something::<T>::put(something);
    
            // Emit an event.
            Self::deposit_event(Event::SomethingStored { something, who });
    
            // Return a successful `DispatchResult`
            Ok(())
        }
    
        #[pallet::call_index(1)]
        #[pallet::weight(Weight::default())]
        pub fn cause_error(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResult {
            let _who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    
            // Read a value from storage.
            match Something::<T>::get() {
                // Return an error if the value has not been set.
                None => Err(Error::<T>::NoneValue.into()),
                Some(old) => {
                    // Increment the value read from storage. This will cause an error in the event
                    // of overflow.
                    let new = old.checked_add(1).ok_or(Error::<T>::StorageOverflow)?;
                    // Update the value in storage with the incremented result.
                    Something::<T>::put(new);
                    Ok(())
                },
            }
        }
    }
}
    ```

# Overview

## Introduction

The runtime is the heart of any Polkadot SDK-based blockchain, handling the essential logic that governs state changes and transaction processing. With Polkadot SDK’s [FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities){target=\_bank}, developers gain access to a powerful suite of tools for building custom blockchain runtimes. FRAME offers a modular architecture, featuring reusable pallets and support libraries, to streamline development.

This guide provides an overview of FRAME, its core components like pallets and system libraries, and demonstrates how to compose a runtime tailored to your specific blockchain use case. Whether you’re integrating pre-built modules or designing custom logic, FRAME equips you with the tools to create scalable, feature-rich blockchains.

## FRAME Runtime Architecture

The following diagram illustrates how FRAME components integrate into the runtime:

All transactions sent to the runtime are handled by the `frame_executive` pallet, which dispatches them to the appropriate pallet for execution. These runtime modules contain the logic for specific blockchain features. The `frame_system` module provides core functions, while `frame_support` libraries offer useful tools to simplify pallet development. Together, these components form the backbone of a FRAME-based blockchain's runtime.

### Pallets

Pallets are modular components within the FRAME ecosystem that encapsulate specific blockchain functionalities. These modules offer customizable business logic for various use cases and features that can be integrated into a runtime.

Developers have the flexibility to implement any desired behavior in the core logic of the blockchain, such as:

- Exposing new transactions
- Storing information
- Enforcing business rules

Pallets also include necessary wiring code to ensure proper integration and functionality within the runtime. FRAME provides a range of [pre-built pallets](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame){target=\_blank} for standard and common blockchain functionalities, including consensus algorithms, staking mechanisms, governance systems, and more. These pre-existing pallets serve as building blocks or templates, which developers can use as-is, modify, or reference when creating custom functionalities. 

#### Pallet Structure

Polkadot SDK heavily utilizes Rust macros, allowing developers to focus on specific functional requirements when writing pallets instead of dealing with technicalities and scaffolding code.

A typical pallet skeleton looks like this:

```rust
pub use pallet::*;

#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
  use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
  use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

  #[pallet::pallet]
  #[pallet::generate_store(pub(super) trait Store)]
  pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

  #[pallet::config]  // snip
  #[pallet::event]   // snip
  #[pallet::error]   // snip
  #[pallet::storage] // snip
  #[pallet::call]    // snip
}
```

All pallets, including custom ones, can implement these attribute macros:

- **`#[frame_support::pallet]`** - marks the module as usable in the runtime
- **`#[pallet::pallet]`** - applied to a structure used to retrieve module information easily
- **`#[pallet::config]`** - defines the configuration for the pallets's data types
- **`#[pallet::event]`** - defines events to provide additional information to users
- **`#[pallet::error]`** - lists possible errors in an enum to be returned upon unsuccessful execution
- **`#[pallet::storage]`** - defines elements to be persisted in storage
- **`#[pallet::call]`** - defines functions exposed as transactions, allowing dispatch to the runtime

These macros are applied as attributes to Rust modules, functions, structures, enums, and types and serve as the core components of a pallet. They enable the pallet to be built and added to the runtime, exposing the custom logic to the outer world.

For a comprehensive guide on these and additional macros, see the [`pallet_macros`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/index.html){target=\_blank} section in the Polkadot SDK documentation.

### Support Libraries

In addition to purpose-specific pallets, FRAME offers services and core libraries that facilitate composing and interacting with the runtime:

- [**`frame_system` pallet**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/index.html){target=\_blank} - provides low-level types, storage, and functions for the runtime
- [**`frame_executive` pallet**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_executive/index.html){target=\_blank} - orchestrates the execution of incoming function calls to the respective pallets in the runtime
- [**`frame_support` crate**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/index.html){target=\_blank} - is a collection of Rust macros, types, traits, and modules that simplify the development of Substrate pallets
- [**`frame_benchmarking` crate**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/trait.Benchmark.html){target=\_blank} - contains common runtime patterns for benchmarking and testing purposes

## Compose a Runtime with Pallets

The Polkadot SDK allows developers to construct a runtime by combining various pallets, both built-in and custom-made. This modular approach enables the creation of unique blockchain behaviors tailored to specific requirements.

The following diagram illustrates the process of selecting and combining FRAME pallets to compose a runtime:

![](/images/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/overview/frame-overview-2.webp)

This modular design allows developers to:

- Rapidly prototype blockchain systems
- Easily add or remove features by including or excluding pallets
- Customize blockchain behavior without rebuilding core components
- Leverage tested and optimized code from built-in pallets

## Starting from Templates

Using pre-built templates is an efficient way to begin building a custom blockchain. Templates provide a foundational setup with pre-configured modules, letting developers avoid starting from scratch and instead focus on customization. Depending on your project’s goals—whether you want a simple test chain, a standalone chain, or a parachain that integrates with Polkadot’s relay chains—there are templates designed to suit different levels of complexity and scalability.

Within the Polkadot SDK, the following templates are available to get you started:

- [**`minimal-template`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/minimal){target=\_blank} - includes only the essential components necessary for a functioning blockchain. It’s ideal for developers who want to gain familiarity with blockchain basics and test simple customizations before scaling up

- [**`solochain-template`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/solochain){target=\_blank} - provides a foundation for creating standalone blockchains with moderate features, including a simple consensus mechanism and several core FRAME pallets. It’s a solid starting point for developers who want a fully functional chain that doesn’t depend on a relay chain

- [**`parachain-template`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/parachain){target=\_blank} - designed for connecting to relay chains like Polkadot, Kusama, or Paseo, this template enables a chain to operate as a parachain. For projects aiming to integrate with Polkadot’s ecosystem, this template offers a great starting point

In addition, several external templates offer unique features and can align with specific use cases or developer familiarity:

- [**`OpenZeppelin`**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/tree/main){target=\_blank} - offers two flexible starting points:
    - The [`generic-runtime-template`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/tree/main/generic-template){target=\_blank} provides a minimal setup with essential pallets and secure defaults, creating a reliable foundation for custom blockchain development
    - The [`evm-runtime-template`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/tree/main/evm-template){target=\_blank} enables EVM compatibility, allowing developers to migrate Solidity contracts and EVM-based dApps. This template is ideal for Ethereum developers looking to leverage Substrate's capabilities

- [**`Tanssi`**](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/tree/master/container-chains/runtime-templates){target=\_blank} - provides developers with pre-built templates that can help accelerate the process of creating appchain

- [**`Pop Network`**](https://learn.onpop.io/appchains/pop-cli/new#templates){target=\_blank} - designed with user-friendliness in mind, Pop Network offers an approachable starting point for new developers, with a simple CLI interface for creating appchains 

Choosing a suitable template depends on your project’s unique requirements, level of customization, and integration needs. Starting from a template speeds up development and lets you focus on implementing your chain’s unique features rather than the foundational blockchain setup.

description: Explains how to use the Polkadot SDK runtime toolbox and Docker to build deterministic Wasm binaries for Polkadot SDK-based chains.

# Build a Deterministic Runtime

## Introduction

By default, the Rust compiler produces optimized Wasm binaries. These binaries are suitable for working in an isolated environment, such as local development. However, the Wasm binaries the compiler builds by default aren't guaranteed to be deterministically reproducible. Each time the compiler generates the Wasm runtime, it might produce a slightly different Wasm byte code. This is problematic in a blockchain network where all nodes must use exactly the same raw chain specification file.

Working with builds that aren't guaranteed to be deterministically reproducible can cause other problems, too. For example, for automating the build processes for a blockchain, it is ideal that the same code always produces the same result (in terms of bytecode). Compiling the Wasm runtime with every push would produce inconsistent and unpredictable results without a deterministic build, making it difficult to integrate with any automation and likely to break a CI/CD pipeline continuously. Deterministic builds—code that always compiles to exactly the same bytecode—ensure that the Wasm runtime can be inspected, audited, and independently verified.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/){target=\_blank} installed.

## Tooling for Wasm Runtime

To compile the Wasm runtime deterministically, the same tooling that produces the runtime for Polkadot, Kusama, and other Polkadot SDK-based chains can be used. This tooling, referred to collectively as the Substrate Runtime Toolbox or [`srtool`](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool){target=\_blank}, ensures that the same source code consistently compiles to an identical Wasm blob.

The core component of `srtool` is a Docker container executed as part of a Docker image. The name of the `srtool` Docker image specifies the version of the Rust compiler used to compile the code included in the image. For example, the image `{{dependencies.srtool.docker_image_name}}:{{dependencies.srtool.docker_image_version}}` indicates that the code in the image was compiled with version `{{dependencies.srtool.docker_image_version}}` of the `rustc` compiler.

## Working with the Docker Container

The [`srtool-cli`](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli){target=\_blank} package is a command-line utility written in Rust that installs an executable program called `srtool`. This program simplifies the interactions with the `srtool` Docker container.

Over time, the tooling around the `srtool` Docker image has expanded to include the following tools and helper programs:

- [**`srtool-cli`**](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli){target=\_blank} - provides a command-line interface to pull the srtool Docker image, get information about the image and tooling used to interact with it, and build the runtime using the `srtool` Docker container
- [**`subwasm`**](https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm){target=\_blank} - provides command-line options for working with the metadata and Wasm runtime built using srtool. The `subwasm` program is also used internally to perform tasks in the `srtool` image
- [**`srtool-actions`**](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-actions){target=\_blank} - provides GitHub actions to integrate builds produced using the `srtool` image with your GitHub CI/CD pipelines
- [**`srtool-app`**](https://gitlab.com/chevdor/srtool-app){target=\_blank} - provides a simple graphical user interface for building the runtime using the `srtool` Docker image

## Prepare the Environment

It is recommended to install the `srtool-cli` program to work with the Docker image using a simple command-line interface.

To prepare the environment:

1. Verify that Docker is installed by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

    If Docker is installed, the command will display version information:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>docker --version</span>
  <span data-ty>Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701</span>
</div>

2. Install the `srtool` command-line interface by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo install --git https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli
    ```

3. View usage information for the `srtool` command-line interface by running the following command:

    ```bash
    srtool help
    ```

4. Download the latest `srtool` Docker image by running the following command:

    ```bash
    srtool pull
    ```

## Start a Deterministic Build

After preparing the environment, the Wasm runtime can be compiled using the `srtool` Docker image.

To build the runtime, you need to open your Polkadot SDK-based project in a terminal shell and run the following command:

```bash
srtool build --app --package INSERT_RUNTIME_PACKAGE_NAME --runtime-dir INSERT_RUNTIME_PATH 
```

- The name specified for the `--package` should be the name defined in the `Cargo.toml` file for the runtime
- The path specified for the `--runtime-dir` should be the path to the `Cargo.toml` file for the runtime. For example:

    ```plain
    node/
    pallets/
    runtime/
    ├──lib.rs
    └──Cargo.toml # INSERT_RUNTIME_PATH should be the path to this file
    ...
    ```

- If the `Cargo.toml` file for the runtime is located in a `runtime` subdirectory, for example, `runtime/kusama`, the `--runtime-dir` parameter can be omitted

## Use srtool in GitHub Actions

To add a GitHub workflow for building the runtime:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in the chain's directory
2. In the `.github/workflows` directory, click **Add file**, then select **Create new file**
3. Copy the sample GitHub action from `basic.yml` example in the [`srtools-actions`](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-actions){target=\_blank} repository and paste it into the file you created in the previous step

    ??? interface "`basic.yml`"

        ```yml
        name: Srtool build

on: push

jobs:
  srtool:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        chain: ["asset-hub-kusama", "asset-hub-westend"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Srtool build
        id: srtool_build
        uses: chevdor/srtool-actions@v0.8.0
        with:
          chain: ${{ matrix.chain }}
          runtime_dir: polkadot-parachains/${{ matrix.chain }}-runtime
      - name: Summary
        run: |
          echo '${{ steps.srtool_build.outputs.json }}' | jq . > ${{ matrix.chain }}-srtool-digest.json
          cat ${{ matrix.chain }}-srtool-digest.json
          echo "Runtime location: ${{ steps.srtool_build.outputs.wasm }}"
        ```

4. Modify the settings in the sample action

    For example, modify the following settings:

    - The name of the chain
    - The name of the runtime package
    - The location of the runtime

5. Type a name for the action file and commit

## Use the srtool Image via Docker Hub

If utilizing [`srtool-cli`](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli){target=\_blank} or [`srtool-app`](https://gitlab.com/chevdor/srtool-app){target=\_blank} isn't an option, the `paritytech/srtool` container image can be used directly via Docker Hub.

To pull the image from Docker Hub:

1. Sign in to Docker Hub
2. Type `paritytech/srtool` in the search field and press enter
3. Click **paritytech/srtool**, then click **Tags**
4. Copy the command for the image you want to pull
5. Open a terminal shell on your local computer
6. Paste the command you copied from the Docker Hub. For example, you might run a command similar to the following, which downloads and unpacks the image:

    ```bash
    docker pull paritytech/srtool:{{ dependencies.srtool.docker_image_version }}
    ```

### Naming Convention for Images

Keep in mind that there is no `latest` tag for the `srtool` image. Ensure that the image selected is compatible with the locally available version of the Rust compiler.

The naming convention for `paritytech/srtool` Docker images specifies the version of the Rust compiler used to compile the code included in the image. Some images specify both a compiler version and the version of the build script used. For example, an image named `paritytech/srtool:1.62.0-0.9.19` was compiled with version `1.62.0` of the `rustc` compiler and version `0.9.19` of the build script. Images that only specify the compiler version always contain the software's latest version.

description: Describes the role of the chain specification in a network, how to specify its parameters when starting a node, and how to customize and distribute it.

# Generate Chain Specs

## Introduction

A chain specification collects information that describes a Polkadot SDK-based network. A chain specification is a crucial parameter when starting a node, providing the genesis configurations, bootnodes, and other parameters relating to that particular network. It identifies the network a blockchain node connects to, the other nodes it initially communicates with, and the initial state that nodes must agree on to produce blocks.

The chain specification is defined using the [`ChainSpec`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_chain_spec/struct.GenericChainSpec.html){target=\_blank} struct. This struct separates the information required for a chain into two parts:

- **Client specification** - contains information the _node_ uses to communicate with network participants and send data to telemetry endpoints. Many of these chain specification settings can be overridden by command-line options when starting a node or can be changed after the blockchain has started

- **Initial genesis state** - agreed upon by all nodes in the network. It must be set when the blockchain is first started and cannot be changed after that without starting a whole new blockchain

## Node Settings Customization

For the node, the chain specification controls information such as:

- The bootnodes the node will communicate with
- The server endpoints for the node to send telemetry data to
- The human and machine-readable names for the network the node will connect to

The chain specification can be customized to include additional information. For example, you can configure the node to connect to specific blocks at specific heights to prevent long-range attacks when syncing a new node from genesis.

Note that you can customize node settings after genesis. However, nodes only add peers that use the same [`protocolId`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_service/struct.GenericChainSpec.html#method.protocol_id){target=_blank}.

## Genesis Configuration Customization

All nodes in the network must agree on the genesis state before they can agree on any subsequent blocks. The information configured in the genesis portion of a chain specification is used to create a genesis block. When you start the first node, it takes effect and cannot be overridden with command-line options. However, you can configure some information in the genesis section of a chain specification. For example, you can customize it to include information such as:

- Initial account balances
- Accounts that are initially part of a governance council
- The account that controls the `sudo` key
- Any other genesis state for a pallet

Nodes also require the compiled Wasm to execute the runtime logic on the chain, so the initial runtime must also be supplied in the chain specification. For a more detailed look at customizing the genesis chain specification, be sure to check out the [Polkadot SDK Docs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/chain_spec_genesis/index.html){target=_blank}.

## Declaring Storage Items for a Runtime

A runtime usually requires some storage items to be configured at genesis. This includes the initial state for pallets, for example, how much balance specific accounts have, or which account will have sudo permissions.

These storage values are configured in the genesis portion of the chain specification. You can create a [patch](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_chain_spec/index.html#chain-spec-formats){target=_blank} file and ingest it using the [`chain-spec-builder`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_chain_spec_builder/index.html){target=_blank} utility, that is explained in the [Creating a Custom Chain Specification](#creating-a-custom-chain-specification) section.

## Chain Specification JSON Format

Users generally work with the JSON format of the chain specification. Internally, the chain specification is embedded in the [`GenericChainSpec`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_chain_spec/struct.GenericChainSpec.html){target=\_blank} struct, with specific properties accessible through the [`ChainSpec`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_chain_spec/trait.ChainSpec.html){target=\_blank} struct. The chain specification includes the following keys:

- **`name`** - the human-readable name for the network
- **`id`** - the machine-readable identifier for the network
- **`chainType`** - the type of chain to start (refer to [`ChainType`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_chain_spec/enum.ChainType.html){target=\_blank} for more details)
- **`bootNodes`** - a list of multiaddresses belonging to the chain's boot nodes
- **`telemetryEndpoints`** - an optional list of multiaddresses for telemetry endpoints with verbosity levels ranging from 0 to 9 (0 being the lowest verbosity)
- **`protocolId`** - the optional protocol identifier for the network
- **`forkId`** - an optional fork ID that should typically be left empty; it can be used to signal a fork at the network level when two chains share the same genesis hash
- **`properties`** - custom properties provided as a key-value JSON object
- **`codeSubstitutes`** - an optional mapping of block numbers to Wasm code
- **`genesis`** - the genesis configuration for the chain

For example, the following JSON shows a basic chain specification file:

```json
{
    "name": "chainName",
    "id": "chainId",
    "chainType": "Local",
    "bootNodes": [],
    "telemetryEndpoints": null,
    "protocolId": null,
    "properties": null,
    "codeSubstitutes": {},
    "genesis": {
        "code": "0x..."
    }
}
``` 

## Creating a Custom Chain Specification

To create a custom chain specification, you can use the [`chain-spec-builder`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_chain_spec_builder/index.html){target=\_blank} tool. This is a CLI tool that is used to generate chain specifications from the runtime of a node. To install the tool, run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk --force staging-chain-spec-builder
```

To verify the installation, run the following:

```bash
chain-spec-builder --help
```

### Plain Chain Specifications

To create a plain chain specification, first ensure that the runtime has been compiled and is available at the specified path. Next, you can use the following utility within your project:

```bash
chain-spec-builder create -r INSERT_RUNTIME_WASM_PATH INSERT_COMMAND
```

Replace `INSERT_RUNTIME_WASM_PATH` with the path to the runtime Wasm file and `INSERT_COMMAND` with the command to insert the runtime into the chain specification. 

The available commands are:

- **`patch`** - overwrites the runtime's default genesis config with the provided patch. You can check the following [patch file](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/bin/utils/chain-spec-builder/tests/input/patch.json){target=\_blank} as a reference
- **`full`** - build the genesis config for runtime using the JSON file. No defaults will be used. As a reference, you can check the following [full file](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/bin/utils/chain-spec-builder/tests/input/full.json){target=\_blank}
- **`default`** - gets the default genesis config for the runtime and uses it in `ChainSpec`. Please note that the default genesis config may not be valid. For some runtimes, initial values should be added there (e.g., session keys, BABE epoch)
- **`named-preset`** - uses named preset provided by the runtime to build the chain spec

### Raw Chain Specifications

With runtime upgrades, the blockchain's runtime can be upgraded with newer business logic. Chain specifications contain information structured in a way that the node's runtime can understand. For example, consider this excerpt of a common entry for a chain specification:

```json
"sudo": {
    "key": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY"
}
```

In the plain chain spec JSON file, the keys and associated values are in a human-readable format, which can be used to initialize the genesis storage. When the chain specification is loaded, the runtime converts these readable values into storage items within the trie. However, for long-lived networks like testnets or production chains, using the raw format for storage initialization is preferred. This avoids the need for conversion by the runtime and ensures that storage items remain consistent, even when runtime upgrades occur.

To enable a node with an upgraded runtime to synchronize with a chain from genesis, the plain chain specification is encoded in a raw format. The raw format allows the distribution of chain specifications that all nodes can use to synchronize the chain even after runtime upgrades.

To convert a plain chain specification to a raw chain specification, you can use the following utility:

```bash
chain-spec-builder convert-to-raw chain_spec.json
```

After the conversion to the raw format, the `sudo key` snippet looks like this:

```json
"0x50a63a871aced22e88ee6466fe5aa5d9": "0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d",
```

The raw chain specification can be used to initialize the genesis storage for a node.

# Deployment

Learn how to prepare your blockchain for deployment using the Polkadot SDK, including building deterministic Wasm runtimes and generating chain specifications.

To better understand the deployment process, check out the following section. If you're ready to start jump to [In This Section](#in-this-section) to begin working through the deployment guides.

## Deployment Process

Taking your Polkadot SDK-based blockchain from a local environment to production involves several steps, ensuring your network is stable, secure, and ready for real-world use. The following diagram outlines the process at a high level:

```

- **Local development and testing** - the process begins with local development and testing. Developers focus on building the runtime by selecting and configuring the necessary pallets while refining network features. In this phase, running a local TestNet is essential to verify transactions and ensure the blockchain behaves as expected. Unit and integration tests ensure the network works as expected before launch. Thorough testing is conducted, not only for individual components but also for interactions between pallets

- **Runtime compilation** - Polkadot SDK-based blockchains are built with Wasm, a highly portable and efficient format. Compiling your blockchain's runtime into Wasm ensures it can be executed reliably across various environments, guaranteeing network-wide compatibility and security. The [srtool](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool){target=\_blank} is helpful for this purpose since it allows you to compile [deterministic runtimes](/develop/parachains/deployment/build-deterministic-runtime/){target=\_blank}

- **Generate chain specifications** - the chain spec file defines the structure and configuration of your blockchain. It includes initial node identities, session keys, and other parameters. Defining a well-thought-out chain specification ensures that your network will operate smoothly and according to your intended design

- **Deployment environment** - whether launching a local test network or a production-grade blockchain, selecting the proper infrastructure is vital. For further information about these topics, see the [Infrastructure](/infrastructure/){target=\_blank} section

- **Acquire coretime** - to build on top of the Polkadot network, users need to acquire coretime (either on-demand or in bulk) to access the computational resources of the relay chain. This allows for the secure validation of parachain blocks through a randomized selection of relay chain validators

If you’re building a standalone blockchain (solochain) that won’t connect to Polkadot as a parachain, you can skip the preceding step, as there’s no need to acquire coretime or implement [Cumulus](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#cumulus){target=\_blank}.

- **Launch and monitor** - once everything is configured, you can launch the blockchain, initiating the network with your chain spec and Wasm runtime. Validators or collators will begin producing blocks, and the network will go live. Post-launch, monitoring is vital to ensuring network health—tracking block production, node performance, and overall security

- **Maintenance and upgrade** - a blockchain continues to evolve post-deployment. As the network expands and adapts, it may require runtime upgrades, governance updates, coretime renewals, and even modifications to the underlying code. For an in-depth guide on this topic, see the [Maintenance](/develop/parachains/maintenance/){target=\_blank} section

# Obtain Coretime

## Introduction

Securing coretime is essential for operating a parachain on Polkadot. It provides your parachain with guaranteed computational resources and access to Polkadot's shared security model, ensuring your blockchain can process transactions, maintain its state, and interact securely with other parachains in the network. Without coretime, a parachain cannot participate in the ecosystem or leverage the relay chain's validator set for security.

Coretime represents the computational resources allocated to your parachain on the Polkadot network. It determines when and how often your parachain can produce blocks and have them validated by the relay chain.

There are two primary methods to obtain coretime:

- **Bulk coretime** - purchase computational resources in advance for a full month
- **On-demand coretime** - buy computational resources as needed for individual block production

This guide explains the different methods of obtaining coretime and walks through the necessary steps to get your parachain running. 

## Prerequisites

Before obtaining coretime, ensure you have:

- Developed your parachain runtime using the Polkadot SDK
- Set up and configured a parachain collator for your target relay chain
- Successfully compiled your parachain collator node
- Generated and exported your parachain's genesis state
- Generated and exported your parachain's validation code (Wasm)

## Initial Setup Steps

1. Reserve a unique identifier, `ParaID`, for your parachain:

    1. Connect to the relay chain
    2. Submit the [`registrar.reserve`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_common/paras_registrar/pallet/dispatchables/fn.reserve.html){target=\_blank} extrinsic

    Upon success, you'll receive a registered `ParaID`

2. Register your parachain's essential information by submitting the [`registrar.register`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_common/paras_registrar/pallet/dispatchables/fn.register.html){target=\_blank} extrinsic with the following parameters:

    - **`id`** - your reserved `ParaID`
    - **`genesisHead`** - your exported genesis state
    - **`validationCode`** - your exported Wasm validation code

3. Start your parachain collator and begin synchronization with the relay chain

## Obtaining Coretime

### Bulk Coretime

Bulk coretime provides several advantages:

- Monthly allocation of resources
- Guaranteed block production slots (every 12 seconds, or 6 seconds with [Asynchronous Backing](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank})
- Priority renewal rights
- Protection against price fluctuations
- Ability to split and resell unused coretime

To purchase bulk coretime:

1. Access the Coretime system parachain
2. Interact with the Broker pallet
3. Purchase your desired amount of coretime
4. Assign the purchased core to your registered `ParaID`

After successfully obtaining coretime, your parachain will automatically start producing blocks at regular intervals.

For current marketplaces and pricing, consult the [Coretime Marketplaces](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-coretime-marketplaces){target=\_blank} page on the Polkadot Wiki.

### On-demand Coretime

On-demand coretime allows for flexible, as-needed block production. To purchase:

1. Ensure your collator node is fully synchronized with the relay chain
2. From the account that registered the `ParaID`, submit the `onDemand.placeOrderAllowDeath` extrinsic with:

    - **`maxAmountFor`** - sufficient funds for the transaction
    - **`paraId`** - your registered `ParaID`

After succesfully executing the extrinsic, your parachain will produce a block.

# Parachains

This section provides a complete guide to working with the Polkadot SDK, from getting started to long-term network maintenance. Discover how to create custom blockchains, test and deploy your parachains, and ensure their continued performance and reliability.

## Building Parachains with the Polkadot SDK

With the [Polkadot relay chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/){target=\_blank} handling security and consensus, parachain developers are free to focus on features such as asset management, governance, and cross-chain communication. The Polkadot SDK equips developers with the tools to build, deploy, and maintain efficient, scalable parachains.

Polkadot SDK’s FRAME framework provides developers with the tools to do the following:

- **Customize parachain runtimes** - [runtimes](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#runtime){target=\_blank} are the core building blocks that define the logic and functionality of Polkadot SDK-based parachains and let developers customize the parameters, rules, and behaviors that shape their blockchain network
- **Develop new pallets** - create custom modular pallets to define runtime behavior and acheive desired blockchain functionality
- **Add smart contract functionality** - use specialized pallets to deploy and execute smart contracts, enhancing your chain's functionality and programmability
- **Test your build for a confident deployment** - create a test environment that can simulate runtime and mock transaction execution
- **Deploy your blockchain for use** - take your Polkadot SDK-based blockchain from a local environment to production
- **Maintain your network including monitoring and upgrades** - runtimes can be ugraded through forkless runtime updates, enabling seamless evolution of the parachain

# Install Polkadot SDK Dependencies

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the dependencies you need to work with the Polkadot SDK-based chains on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Follow the appropriate section for your operating system to ensure all necessary tools are installed and configured properly.

## macOS

You can install Rust and set up a Substrate development environment on Apple macOS computers with Intel or Apple M1 processors.

### Before You Begin

Before you install Rust and set up your development environment on macOS, verify that your computer meets the following basic requirements:

- Operating system version is 10.7 Lion or later
- Processor speed of at least 2 GHz. Note that 3 GHz is recommended
- Memory of at least 8 GB RAM. Note that 16 GB is recommended
- Storage of at least 10 GB of available space
- Broadband Internet connection

#### Install Homebrew

In most cases, you should use Homebrew to install and manage packages on macOS computers. If you don't already have Homebrew installed on your local computer, you should download and install it before continuing.

To install Homebrew:

1. Open the Terminal application

2. Download and install Homebrew by running the following command:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    ```

3. Verify Homebrew has been successfully installed by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew --version
    ```

    The command displays output similar to the following:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>brew --version</span>
  <span data-ty>Homebrew 4.3.15</span>
</div>

#### Support for Apple Silicon

Protobuf must be installed before the build process can begin. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

### Install Required Packages and Rust

Because the blockchain requires standard cryptography to support the generation of public/private key pairs and the validation of transaction signatures, you must also have a package that provides cryptography, such as `openssl`.

To install `openssl` and the Rust toolchain on macOS:

1. Open the Terminal application

2. Ensure you have an updated version of Homebrew by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew update
    ```

3. Install the `openssl` package by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install openssl
    ```

4. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust by running the following
   command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

5. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation

6. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

    ```bash
    source ~/.cargo/env
    ```

7. Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version by running the following
   commands:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable
    rustup update
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

8. Add the `nightly` release and the `nightly` Wasm targets to your development
   environment by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    ```

9. [Verify your installation](#verifying-installation)

10. Install `cmake` using the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install cmake
    ```

## Linux

Rust supports most Linux distributions. Depending on the specific distribution and version of the operating system you use, you might need to add some software dependencies to your environment. In general, your development environment should include a linker or C-compatible compiler, such as `clang` and an appropriate integrated development environment (IDE).

### Before You Begin {: #before-you-begin-linux }

Check the documentation for your operating system for information about the installed packages and how to download and install any additional packages you might need. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) to install the `build-essential` package:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

At a minimum, you need the following packages before you install Rust:

```text
clang curl git make
```

Because the blockchain requires standard cryptography to support the generation of public/private key pairs and the validation of transaction signatures, you must also have a package that provides cryptography, such as `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel`.

### Install Required Packages and Rust {: #install-required-packages-and-rust-linux }

To install the Rust toolchain on Linux:

1. Open a terminal shell

2. Check the packages you have installed on the local computer by running an appropriate package management command for your Linux distribution

3. Add any package dependencies you are missing to your local development environment by running the appropriate package management command for your Linux distribution:

    === "Ubuntu"

        ```bash
        sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev protobuf-compiler
        ```

    === "Debian"

        ```sh
        sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
        ```

    === "Arch"

        ```sh
        pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
        ```

    === "Fedora"

        ```sh
        sudo dnf update
        sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
        ```

    === "OpenSUSE"

        ```sh
        sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
        ```

    Remember that different distributions might use different package managers and bundle packages in different ways. For example, depending on your installation selections, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server might have different packages and different requirements. However, the packages listed in the command-line examples are applicable for many common Linux distributions, including Debian, Linux Mint, MX Linux, and Elementary OS.

4. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

5. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation

6. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

    ```bash
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

7. Verify your installation by running the following command:

    ```bash
    rustc --version
    ```

8. Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable
    rustup update
    ```

9. Add the `nightly` release and the `nightly` Wasm targets to your development environment by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    ```

10. [Verify your installation](#verifying-installation)

## Windows (WSL)

In general, UNIX-based operating systems—like macOS or Linux—provide a better development environment for building Substrate-based blockchains.

However, suppose your local computer uses Microsoft Windows instead of a UNIX-based operating system. In that case, you can configure it with additional software to make it a suitable development environment for building Substrate-based blockchains. To prepare a development environment on a Microsoft Windows computer, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to emulate a UNIX operating environment.

### Before You Begin {: #before-you-begin-windows }

Before installing on Microsoft Windows, verify the following basic requirements:

- You have a computer running a supported Microsoft Windows operating system:
    - **For Windows desktop** - you must be running Microsoft Windows 10, version 2004 or later, or Microsoft Windows 11 to install WSL
    - **For Windows server** - you must be running Microsoft Windows Server 2019, or later, to install WSL on a server operating system
- You have good internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local computer

### Set Up Windows Subsystem for Linux

WSL enables you to emulate a Linux environment on a computer that uses the Windows operating system. The primary advantage of this approach for Substrate development is that you can use all of the code and command-line examples as described in the Substrate documentation. For example, you can run common commands—such as `ls` and `ps`—unmodified. By using WSL, you can avoid configuring a virtual machine image or a dual-boot operating system.

To prepare a development environment using WSL:

1. Check your Windows version and build number to see if WSL is enabled by default.

    If you have Microsoft Windows 10, version 2004 (Build 19041 and higher), or Microsoft Windows 11, WSL is available by default and you can continue to the next step.

    If you have an older version of Microsoft Windows installed, see the [WSL manual installation steps for older versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual){target=\_blank}. If you are installing on an older version of Microsoft Windows, you can download and install WLS 2 if your computer has Windows 10, version 1903 or higher

2. Select **Windows PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** from the **Start** menu, right-click, then **Run as administrator**

3. In the PowerShell or Command Prompt terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```

    This command enables the required WSL 2 components that are part of the Windows operating system, downloads the latest Linux kernel, and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution by default.

    If you want to review the other Linux distributions available, run the following command:

    ```bash
    wsl --list --online
    ```

4. After the distribution is downloaded, close the terminal

5. Click the **Start** menu, select **Shut down or sign out**, then click **Restart** to restart the
   computer.

    Restarting the computer is required to start the installation of the Linux distribution. It can take a few minutes for the installation to complete after you restart.

    For more information about setting up WSL as a development environment, see the [Set up a WSL development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment){target=\_blank} docs

### Install Required Packages and Rust {: #install-required-packages-and-rust-windows }

To install the Rust toolchain on WSL:

1. Click the **Start** menu, then select **Ubuntu**

2. Type a UNIX user name to create user account

3. Type a password for your UNIX user, then retype the password to confirm it

4. Download the latest updates for the Ubuntu distribution using the Ubuntu Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

5. Add the required packages for the Ubuntu distribution by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
    ```

6. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust for the Ubuntu distribution by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

7. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation

8. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

    ```bash
    source ~/.cargo/env
    ```

9. Verify your installation by running the following command:

    ```bash
    rustc --version
    ```

10. Configure the Rust toolchain to use the latest stable version as the default toolchain by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable
    rustup update
    ```

11. Add the `nightly` version of the toolchain and the `nightly` Wasm target to your development environment by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    ```

12. [Verify your installation](#verifying-installation)

## Verifying Installation

Verify the configuration of your development environment by running the following command:

```bash
rustup show
rustup +nightly show
```

The command displays output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>rustup show</span>

# Introduction to Polkadot SDK

## Introduction

The [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}){target=\_blank} is a powerful and versatile developer kit designed to facilitate building on the Polkadot network. It provides the necessary components for creating custom blockchains, parachains, generalized rollups, and more. Written in the Rust programming language, it puts security and robustness at the forefront of its design.

Whether you're building a standalone chain or deploying a parachain on Polkadot, this SDK equips developers with the libraries and tools needed to manage runtime logic, compile the codebase, and utilize core features like staking, governance, and Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM). It also provides a means for building generalized peer-to-peer systems beyond blockchains. The Polkadot SDK houses the following overall functionality:

- Networking and peer-to-peer communication (powered by [Libp2p](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#libp2p){target=\_blank})
- Consensus protocols, such as [BABE](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#blind-assignment-of-blockchain-extension-babe){target=\_blank}, [GRANDPA](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#grandpa){target=\_blank}, or [Aura](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#authority-round-aura){target=\_blank}
- Cryptography
- The ability to create portable Wasm runtimes
- A selection of pre-built modules, called [pallets](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#pallet){target=\_blank}
- Benchmarking and testing suites

For an in-depth look at the monorepo, see the [Polkadot SDK Rust documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## Polkadot SDK Overview

The Polkadot SDK is composed of five major components:

![](/images/develop/parachains/intro-polkadot-sdk/intro-polkadot-sdk-1.webp)

- [**Substrate**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/substrate/index.html){target=\_blank} - a set of libraries and primitives for building blockchains
- [**FRAME**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html){target=\_blank} - a blockchain development framework built on top of Substrate
- [**Cumulus**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/cumulus/index.html){target=\_blank} - a set of libraries and pallets to add parachain capabilities to a Substrate/FRAME runtime
- [**XCM (Cross Consensus Messaging)**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/xcm/index.html){target=\_blank} - the primary format for conveying messages between parachains
- [**Polkadot**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/polkadot/index.html){target=\_blank} - the node implementation for the Polkadot protocol

### Substrate

Substrate is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that uses Rust-based libraries and tools to enable you to build application-specific blockchains from modular and extensible components. Application-specific blockchains built with Substrate can run as standalone services or in parallel with other chains to take advantage of the shared security provided by the Polkadot ecosystem. Substrate includes default implementations of the core components of the blockchain infrastructure to allow you to focus on the application logic.

Every blockchain platform relies on a decentralized network of computers—called nodes—that communicate with each other about transactions and blocks. In general, a node in this context is the software running on the connected devices rather than the physical or virtual machine in the network. As software, Substrate-based nodes consist of two main parts with separate responsibilities:

- **Client** - services to handle network and blockchain infrastructure activity
    - Native binary
    - Executes the Wasm runtime
    - Manages components like database, networking, mempool, consensus, and others
    - Also known as "Host"
- **Runtime** - business logic for state transitions
    - Application logic
    - Compiled to [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/){target=\_blank}
    - Stored as a part of the chain state
    - Also known as State Transition Function (STF)

```

### FRAME

FRAME provides the core modular and extensible components that make the Substrate SDK flexible and adaptable to different use cases. FRAME includes Rust-based libraries that simplify the development of application-specific logic. Most of the functionality that FRAME provides takes the form of plug-in modules called [pallets](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#pallet){target=\_blank} that you can add and configure to suit your requirements for a custom runtime.

### Cumulus

Cumulus provides utilities and libraries to turn FRAME-based runtimes into runtimes that can be a parachain on Polkadot. Cumulus runtimes are still FRAME runtimes but contain the necessary functionality that allows that runtime to become a parachain on a relay chain.

## Why Use Polkadot SDK?

Using the Polkadot SDK, you can build application-specific blockchains without the complexity of building a blockchain from scratch or the limitations of building on a general-purpose blockchain. You can focus on crafting the business logic that makes your chain unique and innovative with the additional benefits of flexibility, upgradeability, open-source licensing, and cross-consensus interoperability.

## Create a Custom Blockchain Using the SDK

Before starting your blockchain development journey, you'll need to decide whether you want to build a standalone chain or a parachain that connects to the Polkadot network. Each path has its considerations and requirements. Once you've made this decision, follow these development stages:

# Runtime Metrics and Monitoring

## Introduction

Maintaining a stable, secure, and efficient network requires continuous monitoring. Polkadot SDK-based nodes are equipped with built-in telemetry components that automatically collect and transmit detailed data about node performance in real-time. This telemetry system is a core feature of the Substrate framework, allowing for easy monitoring of network health without complex setup.

[Substrate's client telemetry](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_telemetry/index.html){target=\_blank} enables real-time data ingestion, which can be visualized on a client dashboard. The telemetry process uses tracing and logging to gather operational data. This data is sent through a tracing layer to a background task called the [`TelemetryWorker`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_telemetry/struct.TelemetryWorker.html){target=\_blank}, which then forwards it to configured remote telemetry servers.

If multiple Substrate nodes run within the same process, the telemetry system uses a `tracing::Span` to distinguish data from each node. This ensures that each task, managed by the `sc-service`'s [`TaskManager`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_service/struct.TaskManager.html){target=\_blank}, inherits a span for data consistency, making it easy to track parallel node operations. Each node can be monitored for basic metrics, such as block height, peer connections, CPU usage, and memory. Substrate nodes expose these metrics at the `host:9615/metrics` endpoint, accessible locally by default. To expose metrics on all interfaces, start a node with the `--prometheus-external` flag.

As a developer or node operator, the telemetry system handles most of the technical setup. Collected data is automatically sent to a default telemetry server, where it’s aggregated and displayed on a dashboard, making it easy to monitor network performance and identify issues.

## Runtime Metrics

Substrate exposes a variety of metrics about the operation of your network, such as the number of peer connections, memory usage, and block production. To capture and visualize these metrics, you can configure and use tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank} and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/){target=\_blank}. At a high level, Substrate exposes telemetry data that can be consumed by the Prometheus endpoint and then presented as visual information in a Grafana dashboard or graph. The provided diagram offers a simplified overview of how the interaction between Substrate, Prometheus, and Grafana can be configured to display information about node operations.

```mermaid
graph TD
  subNode([Substrate Node]) --> telemetryStream[Exposed Telemetry Stream]
  telemetryStream --> prometheus[Prometheus]
  prometheus --> endpoint[Endpoint: Every 1 minute]
  endpoint --> grafana[Grafana]
  grafana --> userOpen[User Opens a Graph]
  prometheus --> localData[Local Prometheus Data]
  localData --> getmetrics[Get Metrics]
```

The diagram shows the flow of data from the Substrate node to the monitoring and visualization components. The Substrate node exposes a telemetry stream, which is consumed by Prometheus. Prometheus is configured to collect data every minute and store it. Grafana is then used to visualize the data, allowing the user to open graphs and retrieve specifc metrics from the telemetry stream.

## Visual Monitoring

The [Polkadot telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank} dashboard provides a real-time view of how currently online nodes are performing. This dashboard, allows users to select the network you need to check on, and also the information you want to display by turning visible columns on and off from the list of columns available. The monitoring dashboard provides the following indicators and metrics:

- **Validator** - identifies whether the node is a validator node or not
- **Location** - displays the geographical location of the node
- **Implementation** - shows the version of the software running on the node
- **Network ID** - displays the public network identifier for the node
- **Peer count** - indicates the number of peers connected to the node
- **Transactions in queue** - shows the number of transactions waiting in the [`Ready` queue](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_transaction_pool_api/enum.TransactionStatus.html#variant.Ready){target=\_blank} for a block author
- **Upload bandwidth** - graphs the node's recent upload activity in MB/s
- **Download bandwidth** - graphs the node's recent download activity in MB/s
- **State cache size** - graphs the size of the node's state cache in MB
- **Block** - displays the current best block number to ensure synchronization with peers
- **Block hash** - shows the block hash for the current best block number
- **Finalized block** - displays the most recently finalized block number to ensure synchronization with peers
- **Finalized block hash** - shows the block hash for the most recently finalized block
- **Block time** - indicates the time between block executions
- **Block propagation time** - displays the time it took to import the most recent block
- **Last block time** - shows the time it took to author the most recent block
- **Node uptime** - indicates the number of days the node has been online without restarting

## Displaying Network-Wide Statistics

In addition to the details available for individual nodes, you can view statistics that provide insights into the broader network. The network statistics provide detailed information about the hardware and software configurations of the nodes in the network, including:

- Software version
- Operating system
- CPU architecture and model
- Number of physical CPU cores
- Total memory
- Whether the node is a virtual machine
- Linux distribution and kernel version
- CPU and memory speed
- Disk speed

## Customizing Monitoring Tools

The default telemetry dashboard offers core metrics without additional setup. However, many projects prefer custom telemetry setups with more advanced monitoring and alerting policies.

Typically, setting up a custom telemetry solution involves establishing monitoring and alerting policies for both on-chain events and individual node operations. This allows for more tailored monitoring and reporting compared to the default telemetry setup.

### On-Chain Activity

You can monitor specific on-chain events like transactions from certain addresses or changes in the validator set. Connecting to RPC nodes allows tracking for delays or specific event timings. Running your own RPC servers is recommended for reliable queries, as public RPC nodes may occasionally be unreliable.

## Monitoring Tools

To implement customized monitoring and alerting, consider using the following stack:

- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank} - collects metrics at intervals, stores data in a time series database, and applies rules for evaluation
- [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/){target=\_blank} - visualizes collected data through customizable dashboards
- [**Node exporter**](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter){target=\_blank} - reports host metrics, including CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage
- [**Alert manager**](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager){target=\_blank} - manages alerts, routing them based on defined rules
- [**Loki**](https://github.com/grafana/loki){target=\_blank} - scalable log aggregator for searching and viewing logs across infrastructure

### Change the Telemetry Server

Once backend monitoring is configured, use the `--telemetry-url` flag when starting a node to specify telemetry endpoints and verbosity levels. Multiple telemetry URLs can be provided, and verbosity ranges from 0 (least verbose) to 9 (most verbose).

For instance, setting a custom telemetry server with verbosity level 5 would look like:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev \
  --telemetry-url "wss://192.168.48.1:9616 5" \
  --prometheus-port 9616 \
  --prometheus-external
```

For more information on the backend components for telemetry or configuring your own server, you can refer to the [`substrate-telemetry`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-telemetry){target=\_blank} project or the [Substrate Telemetry Helm Chart](https://github.com/paritytech/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/substrate-telemetry/README.md){target=\_blank} for Kubernetes deployments.

# Runtime Upgrades

## Introduction

One of the defining features of Polkadot SDK-based blockchains is the ability to perform forkless runtime upgrades. Unlike traditional blockchains, which require hard forks and node coordination for upgrades, Polkadot networks enable seamless updates without network disruption.

Forkless upgrades are achieved through WebAssembly (Wasm) runtimes stored on-chain, which can be securely swapped and upgraded as part of the blockchain's state. By leveraging decentralized consensus, runtime updates can be happen trustlessly, ensuring continuous improvement and evolution without halting operations.

This guide explains how Polkadot's runtime versioning, Wasm deployment, and storage migrations enable these upgrades, ensuring the blockchain evolves smoothly and securely. You'll also learn how different upgrade processes apply to solo chains and parachains, depending on the network setup.

## How Runtime Upgrades Work

In FRAME, the [`system`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet uses the [`set_code`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.set_code){target=\_blank} extrinsic to update the Wasm code for the runtime. This method allows solo chains to upgrade without disruption. 

For parachains, upgrades are more complex. Parachains must first call `authorize_upgrade`, followed by `apply_authorized_upgrade`, to ensure the relay chain approves and applies the changes. Additionally, changes to current functionality that impact storage often require a [storage migration](#storage-migrations).

### Runtime Versioning

The executor is the component that selects the runtime execution environment to communicate with. Although you can override the default execution strategies for custom scenarios, in most cases, the executor selects the appropriate binary to use by evaluating and comparing key parameters from the native and Wasm runtime binaries.

The runtime includes a [runtime version struct](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_version/struct.RuntimeVersion.html){target=\_blank} to provide the needed parameter information to the executor process. A sample runtime version struct might look as follows:

```rust
pub const VERSION: RuntimeVersion = RuntimeVersion {
    spec_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
    impl_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
    authoring_version: 1,
    spec_version: 1,
    impl_version: 1,
    apis: RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS,
    transaction_version: 1,
};
```

The struct provides the following parameter information to the executor:

- **`spec_name`** - the identifier for the different runtimes
- **`impl_name`** - the name of the implementation of the spec. Serves only to differentiate code of different implementation teams
- **`authoring_version`** - the version of the authorship interface. An authoring node won't attempt to author blocks unless this is equal to its native runtime
- **`spec_version`** - the version of the runtime specification. A full node won't attempt to use its native runtime in substitute for the on-chain Wasm runtime unless the `spec_name`, `spec_version`, and `authoring_version` are all the same between the Wasm and native binaries. Updates to the `spec_version` can be automated as a CI process, as is done for the [Polkadot network](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/mirrors/polkadot/-/blob/master/scripts/ci/gitlab/check_extrinsics_ordering.sh){target=\_blank}. This parameter is typically incremented when there's an update to the `transaction_version`
- **`impl_version`** - the version of the implementation of the specification. Nodes can ignore this. It is only used to indicate that the code is different. As long as the `authoring_version` and the `spec_version` are the same, the code might have changed, but the native and Wasm binaries do the same thing. In general, only non-logic-breaking optimizations would result in a change of the `impl_version`
- **`transaction_version`** - the version of the interface for handling transactions. This parameter can be useful to synchronize firmware updates for hardware wallets or other signing devices to verify that runtime transactions are valid and safe to sign. This number must be incremented if there is a change in the index of the pallets in the `construct_runtime!` macro or if there are any changes to dispatchable functions, such as the number of parameters or parameter types. If `transaction_version` is updated, then the `spec_version` must also be updated
- **`apis`** - a list of supported [runtime APIs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_api/macro.impl_runtime_apis.html){target=\_blank} along with their versions                                                    

The executor follows the same consensus-driven logic for both the native runtime and the Wasm runtime before deciding which to execute. Because runtime versioning is a manual process, there is a risk that the executor could make incorrect decisions if the runtime version is misrepresented or incorrectly defined.

### Accessing the Runtime Version

The runtime version can be accessed through the `state.getRuntimeVersion` RPC endpoint, which accepts an optional block identifier. It can also be accessed through the runtime metadata to understand the APIs the runtime exposes and how to interact with them.

The runtime metadata should only change when the chain's [runtime `spec_version`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_version/struct.RuntimeVersion.html#structfield.spec_version){target=\_blank} changes.

## Storage Migrations

[Storage migrations](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/frame_runtime_upgrades_and_migrations/index.html#migrations){target=\_blank} are custom, one-time functions that allow you to update storage to adapt to changes in the runtime.

For example, if a runtime upgrade changes the data type used to represent user balances from an unsigned integer to a signed integer, the storage migration would read the existing value as an unsigned integer and write back an updated value that has been converted to a signed integer.

If you don't make changes to how data is stored when needed, the runtime can't properly interpret the storage values to include in the runtime state and is likely to lead to undefined behavior.

### Storage Migrations with FRAME

FRAME storage migrations are implemented using the [`OnRuntimeUpgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.OnRuntimeUpgrade.html){target=\_blank} trait. The `OnRuntimeUpgrade` trait specifies a single function, `on_runtime_upgrade`, that allows you to specify logic to run immediately after a runtime upgrade but before any `on_initialize` functions or transactions are executed.

For further details about this process, see the [Storage Migrations](/develop/parachains/maintenance/storage-migrations/){target=\_blank} page.

### Ordering Migrations

By default, FRAME orders the execution of `on_runtime_upgrade` functions based on the order in which the pallets appear in the `construct_runtime!` macro. The functions run in reverse order for upgrades, starting with the last pallet executed first. You can impose a custom order if needed.

FRAME storage migrations run in this order:

1. Custom `on_runtime_upgrade` functions if using a custom order
2. System `frame_system::on_runtime_upgrade` functions
3. All `on_runtime_upgrade` functions defined in the runtime starting with the last pallet in the `construct_runtime!` macro

# Storage Migrations

## Introduction

Storage migrations are a crucial part of the runtime upgrade process. They allow you to update the [storage items](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.storage.html){target=\_blank} of your blockchain, adapting to changes in the runtime. Whenever you change the encoding or data types used to represent data in storage, you'll need to provide a storage migration to ensure the runtime can correctly interpret the existing stored values in the new runtime state.

Storage migrations must be executed precisely during the runtime upgrade process to ensure data consistency and prevent [runtime panics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html){target=\_blank}. The migration code needs to run as follows:

- After the new runtime is deployed
- Before any other code from the new runtime executes
- Before any [`on_initialize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_initialize){target=\_blank} hooks run
- Before any transactions are processed

This timing is critical because the new runtime expects data to be in the updated format. Any attempt to decode the old data format without proper migration could result in runtime panics or undefined behavior.

## Storage Migration Scenarios

A storage migration is necessary whenever a runtime upgrade changes the storage layout or the encoding/interpretation of existing data. Even if the underlying data type appears to still "fit" the new storage representation, a migration may be required if the interpretation of the stored values has changed.

Storage migrations ensure data consistency and prevent corruption during runtime upgrades. Below are common scenarios categorized by their impact on storage and migration requirements:

- Migration required:
    - Reordering or mutating fields of an existing data type to change the encoded/decoded data representation
    - Removal of a pallet or storage item warrants cleaning up storage via a migration to avoid state bloat

- Migration not required:
    - Adding a new storage item would not require any migration since no existing data needs transformation
    - Adding or removing an extrinsic introduces no new interpretation of preexisting data, so no migration is required

The following are some common scenarios where a storage migration is needed:

- **Changing data types** - changing the underlying data type requires a migration to convert the existing values

    ```rust
    #[pallet::storage]
pub type FooValue = StorageValue<_, Foo>;
// old
pub struct Foo(u32)
// new
pub struct Foo(u64)
    ```

- **Changing data representation** - modifying the representation of the stored data, even if the size appears unchanged, requires a migration to ensure the runtime can correctly interpret the existing values

    ```rust
    #[pallet::storage]
pub type FooValue = StorageValue<_, Foo>;
// old
pub struct Foo(u32)
// new
pub struct Foo(i32)
// or
pub struct Foo(u16, u16)
    ```

- **Extending an enum** - adding new variants to an enum requires a migration if you reorder existing variants, insert new variants between existing ones, or change the data type of existing variants. No migration is required when adding new variants at the end of the enum

    ```rust
    #[pallet::storage]
pub type FooValue = StorageValue<_, Foo>;
// old
pub enum Foo { A(u32), B(u32) }
// new (New variant added at the end. No migration required)
pub enum Foo { A(u32), B(u32), C(u128) }
// new (Reordered variants. Requires migration)
pub enum Foo { A(u32), C(u128), B(u32) }
    ```

- **Changing the storage key** - modifying the storage key, even if the underlying data type remains the same, requires a migration to ensure the runtime can locate the correct stored values.

    ```rust
    #[pallet::storage]
pub type FooValue = StorageValue<_, u32>;
// new
#[pallet::storage]
pub type BarValue = StorageValue<_, u32>;
    ```

!!!warning
    In general, any change to the storage layout or data encoding used in your runtime requires careful consideration of the need for a storage migration. Overlooking a necessary migration can lead to undefined behavior or data loss during a runtime upgrade.

## Implement Storage Migrations

The [`OnRuntimeUpgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.OnRuntimeUpgrade.html){target=\_blank} trait provides the foundation for implementing storage migrations in your runtime. Here's a detailed look at its essential functions:

```rust
pub trait OnRuntimeUpgrade {
    fn on_runtime_upgrade() -> Weight { ... }
    fn try_on_runtime_upgrade(checks: bool) -> Result<Weight, TryRuntimeError> { ... }
    fn pre_upgrade() -> Result<Vec<u8>, TryRuntimeError> { ... }
    fn post_upgrade(_state: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), TryRuntimeError> { ... }
}
```

### Core Migration Function

The [`on_runtime_upgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_runtime_upgrade){target=\_blank} function executes when the FRAME Executive pallet detects a runtime upgrade. Important considerations when using this function include:

- It runs before any pallet's `on_initialize` hooks
- Critical storage items (like [`block_number`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.block_number){target=\_blank}) may not be set
- Execution is mandatory and must be completed
- Careful weight calculation is required to prevent bricking the chain

When implementing the migration logic, your code must handle several vital responsibilities. A migration implementation must do the following to operate correctly:

- Read existing storage values in their original format
- Transform data to match the new format
- Write updated values back to storage
- Calculate and return consumed weight

### Migration Testing Hooks

The `OnRuntimeUpgrade` trait provides some functions designed specifically for testing migrations. These functions never execute on-chain but are essential for validating migration behavior in test environments. The migration test hooks are as follows:

- **[`try_on_runtime_upgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.OnRuntimeUpgrade.html#method.try_on_runtime_upgrade){target=\_blank}** - this function serves as the primary orchestrator for testing the complete migration process. It coordinates the execution flow from `pre-upgrade` checks through the actual migration to `post-upgrade` verification. Handling the entire migration sequence ensures that storage modifications occur correctly and in the proper order. Preserving this sequence is particularly valuable when testing multiple dependent migrations, where the execution order matters

- **[`pre_upgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.pre_upgrade){target=\_blank}** - before a runtime upgrade begins, the `pre_upgrade` function performs preliminary checks and captures the current state. It returns encoded state data that can be used for `post-upgrade` verification. This function must never modify storage - it should only read and verify the existing state. The data it returns includes critical state values that should remain consistent or transform predictably during migration

- **[`post_upgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.post_upgrade){target=\_blank}** - after the migration completes, `post_upgrade` validates its success. It receives the state data captured by `pre_upgrade` to verify that the migration was executed correctly. This function checks for storage consistency and ensures all data transformations are completed as expected. Like `pre_upgrade`, it operates exclusively in testing environments and should not modify storage

### Migration Structure

There are two approaches to implementing storage migrations. The first method involves directly implementing `OnRuntimeUpgrade` on structs. This approach requires manually checking the on-chain storage version against the new [`StorageVersion`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/struct.StorageVersion.html){target=\_blank} and executing the transformation logic only when the check passes. This version verification prevents multiple executions of the migration during subsequent runtime upgrades.

The recommended approach is to implement [`UncheckedOnRuntimeUpgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.UncheckedOnRuntimeUpgrade.html){target=\_blank} and wrap it with [`VersionedMigration`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/migrations/struct.VersionedMigration.html){target=\_blank}. `VersionedMigration` implements `OnRuntimeUpgrade` and handles storage version management automatically, following best practices and reducing potential errors.

`VersionedMigration` requires five type parameters:

- `From` - the source version for the upgrade
- `To` - the target version for the upgrade
- `Inner` - the `UncheckedOnRuntimeUpgrade` implementation
- `Pallet` - the pallet being upgraded
- `Weight` - the runtime's [`RuntimeDbWeight`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/weights/struct.RuntimeDbWeight.html){target=\_blank} implementation

Examine the following migration example that transforms a simple `StorageValue` storing a `u32` into a more complex structure that tracks both current and previous values using the `CurrentAndPreviousValue` struct:

- Old `StorageValue` format:
```rust
#[pallet::storage]
pub type Value<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
```

- New `StorageValue` format:
```rust
/// Example struct holding the most recently set [`u32`] and the
/// second most recently set [`u32`] (if one existed).
#[docify::export]
#[derive(
	Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Encode, Decode, RuntimeDebug, scale_info::TypeInfo, MaxEncodedLen,
)]
pub struct CurrentAndPreviousValue {
	/// The most recently set value.
	pub current: u32,
	/// The previous value, if one existed.
	pub previous: Option<u32>,
}

#[pallet::storage]
	pub type Value<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, CurrentAndPreviousValue>;
```

- Migration:
```rust
use frame_support::{
	storage_alias,
	traits::{Get, UncheckedOnRuntimeUpgrade},
};

#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
use alloc::vec::Vec;

/// Collection of storage item formats from the previous storage version.
///
/// Required so we can read values in the v0 storage format during the migration.
mod v0 {
	use super::*;

	/// V0 type for [`crate::Value`].
	#[storage_alias]
	pub type Value<T: crate::Config> = StorageValue<crate::Pallet<T>, u32>;
}

/// Implements [`UncheckedOnRuntimeUpgrade`], migrating the state of this pallet from V0 to V1.
///
/// In V0 of the template [`crate::Value`] is just a `u32`. In V1, it has been upgraded to
/// contain the struct [`crate::CurrentAndPreviousValue`].
///
/// In this migration, update the on-chain storage for the pallet to reflect the new storage
/// layout.
pub struct InnerMigrateV0ToV1<T: crate::Config>(core::marker::PhantomData<T>);

		Ok(old_value.encode())

	fn on_runtime_upgrade() -> frame_support::weights::Weight {
		// Read the old value from storage

			// Write the new value to storage
			let new = crate::CurrentAndPreviousValue { current: old_value, previous: None };
			crate::Value::<T>::put(new);
			// One read + write for taking the old value, and one write for setting the new value
			T::DbWeight::get().reads_writes(1, 2)
		} else {
			// No writes since there was no old value, just one read for checking
			T::DbWeight::get().reads(1)
		}
	}

	/// Verifies the storage was migrated correctly.
	///
	/// - If there was no old value, the new value should not be set.
	/// - If there was an old value, the new value should be a [`crate::CurrentAndPreviousValue`].
	#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
	fn post_upgrade(state: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), sp_runtime::TryRuntimeError> {
		use codec::Decode;
		use frame_support::ensure;

		let maybe_old_value = Option::<u32>::decode(&mut &state[..]).map_err(|_| {

				let actual_new_value = crate::Value::<T>::get();

				ensure!(actual_new_value.is_some(), "New value not set");
				ensure!(

		Ok(())

```

### Migration Organization

Best practices recommend organizing migrations in a separate module within your pallet. Here's the recommended file structure:

```plain
my-pallet/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs       # Main pallet implementation
│   └── migrations/  # All migration-related code
│       ├── mod.rs   # Migrations module definition
│       ├── v1.rs    # V0 -> V1 migration
│       └── v2.rs    # V1 -> V2 migration
└── Cargo.toml
```

This structure provides several benefits:

- Separates migration logic from core pallet functionality
- Makes migrations easier to test and maintain
- Provides explicit versioning of storage changes
- Simplifies the addition of future migrations

### Scheduling Migrations

To execute migrations during a runtime upgrade, you must configure them in your runtime's Executive pallet. Add your migrations in `runtime/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
/// Tuple of migrations (structs that implement `OnRuntimeUpgrade`)
type Migrations = (
    pallet_my_pallet::migrations::v1::Migration,
    // More migrations can be added here
);
pub type Executive = frame_executive::Executive<
    Runtime,
    Block,
    frame_system::ChainContext<Runtime>,
    Runtime,
    AllPalletsWithSystem,
    Migrations, // Include migrations here
>;
```

## Single-Block Migrations

Single-block migrations execute their logic within one block immediately following a runtime upgrade. They run as part of the runtime upgrade process through the `OnRuntimeUpgrade` trait implementation and must be completed before any other runtime logic executes.

While single-block migrations are straightforward to implement and provide immediate data transformation, they carry significant risks. The most critical consideration is that they must complete within one block's weight limits. This is especially crucial for parachains, where exceeding block weight limits will brick the chain.

Use single-block migrations only when you can guarantee:

- The migration has a bounded execution time
- Weight calculations are thoroughly tested
- Total weight will never exceed block limits

For a complete implementation example of a single-block migration, refer to the [single-block migration example]( https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_example_single_block_migrations/index.html){target=\_blank} in the Polkadot SDK documentation.

## Multi Block Migrations

Multi-block migrations distribute the migration workload across multiple blocks, providing a safer approach for production environments. The migration state is tracked in storage, allowing the process to pause and resume across blocks.

This approach is essential for production networks and parachains as the risk of exceeding block weight limits is eliminated. Multi-block migrations can safely handle large storage collections, unbounded data structures, and complex nested data types where weight consumption might be unpredictable.

Multi-block migrations are ideal when dealing with:

- Large-scale storage migrations
- Unbounded storage items or collections
- Complex data structures with uncertain weight costs

The primary trade-off is increased implementation complexity, as you must manage the migration state and handle partial completion scenarios. However, multi-block migrations' significant safety benefits and operational reliability are typically worth the increased complexity.

For a complete implementation example of multi-block migrations, refer to the [official example](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame/examples/multi-block-migrations){target=\_blank} in the Polkadot SDK.

# Benchmarking

## Introduction

Benchmarking is a critical component of developing efficient and secure blockchain runtimes. In the Polkadot ecosystem, accurately benchmarking your custom pallets ensures that each extrinsic has a precise [weight](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight){target=\_blank}, representing its computational and storage demands. This process is vital for maintaining the blockchain's performance and preventing potential vulnerabilities, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

The Polkadot SDK leverages the [FRAME](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities){target=\_blank} benchmarking framework, offering tools to measure and assign weights to extrinsics. These weights help determine the maximum number of transactions or system-level calls processed within a block. This guide covers how to use FRAME's [benchmarking framework](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/v2/index.html){target=\_blank}, from setting up your environment to writing and running benchmarks for your custom pallets. You'll understand how to generate accurate weights by the end, ensuring your runtime remains performant and secure.

## The Case for Benchmarking

Benchmarking helps validate that the required execution time for different functions is within reasonable boundaries to ensure your blockchain runtime can handle transactions efficiently and securely. By accurately measuring the weight of each extrinsic, you can prevent service interruptions caused by computationally intensive calls that exceed block time limits. Without benchmarking, runtime performance could be vulnerable to DoS attacks, where malicious users exploit functions with unoptimized weights.

Benchmarking also ensures predictable transaction fees. Weights derived from benchmark tests accurately reflect the resource usage of function calls, allowing fair fee calculation. This approach discourages abuse while maintaining network reliability.

### Benchmarking and Weight 

In Polkadot SDK-based chains, weight quantifies the computational effort needed to process transactions. This weight includes factors such as:

- Computational complexity
- Storage complexity (proof size)
- Database reads and writes 
- Hardware specifications

Benchmarking uses real-world testing to simulate worst-case scenarios for extrinsics. The framework generates a linear model for weight calculation by running multiple iterations with varied parameters. These worst-case weights ensure blocks remain within execution limits, enabling the runtime to maintain throughput under varying loads. Excess fees can be refunded if a call uses fewer resources than expected, offering users a fair cost model.
  
Because weight is a generic unit of measurement based on computation time for a specific physical machine, the weight of any function can change based on the specifications of hardware used for benchmarking. By modeling the expected weight of each runtime function, the blockchain can calculate the number of transactions or system-level calls it can execute within a certain period.

Within FRAME, each function call that is dispatched must have a `#[pallet::weight]` annotation that can return the expected weight for the worst-case scenario execution of that function given its inputs:

```rust hl_lines="2"
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::do_something())]
pub fn do_something(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo { Ok(()) }
```

The `WeightInfo` file is automatically generated during benchmarking. Based on these tests, this file provides accurate weights for each extrinsic.

## Benchmarking Process

Benchmarking a pallet involves the following steps: 

1. Creating a `benchmarking.rs` file within your pallet's structure
2. Writing a benchmarking test for each extrinsic
3. Executing the benchmarking tool to calculate weights based on performance metrics

The benchmarking tool runs multiple iterations to model worst-case execution times and determine the appropriate weight. By default, the benchmarking pipeline is deactivated. To activate it, compile your runtime with the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag.

### Prepare Your Environment

Install the [`frame-omni-bencher`](https://crates.io/crates/frame-omni-bencher){target=\_blank} command-line tool:

```bash
cargo install frame-omni-bencher
```

Before writing benchmark tests, you need to ensure the `frame-benchmarking` crate is included in your pallet's `Cargo.toml` similar to the following:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
frame-benchmarking = { version = "37.0.0", default-features = false }
runtime-benchmarks = [
  "frame-benchmarking/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-support/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-system/runtime-benchmarks",
  "sp-runtime/runtime-benchmarks",
]
std = [
  # ...
  "frame-benchmarking?/std",
  # ...
]
```

You must also ensure that you add the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag as follows under the `[features]` section of your pallet's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
"frame-benchmarking/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-support/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-system/runtime-benchmarks",
  "sp-runtime/runtime-benchmarks",
]
```

Lastly, ensure that `frame-benchmarking` is included in `std = []`: 

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
# ...
  "frame-benchmarking?/std",
  # ...
]
```

Once complete, you have the required dependencies for writing benchmark tests for your pallet.

### Write Benchmark Tests

Create a `benchmarking.rs` file in your pallet's `src/`. Your directory structure should look similar to the following:

```
my-pallet/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs          # Main pallet implementation
│   └── benchmarking.rs # Benchmarking
└── Cargo.toml
```

With the directory structure set, you can use the [`polkadot-sdk-parachain-template`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template/tree/master/pallets){target=\_blank} to get started as follows:

```rust title="benchmarking.rs (starter template)"
//! Benchmarking setup for pallet-template
#![cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]

use super::*;
use frame_benchmarking::v2::*;

#[benchmarks]
mod benchmarks {
	use super::*;
	#[cfg(test)]
	use crate::pallet::Pallet as Template;
	use frame_system::RawOrigin;

	#[benchmark]
	fn do_something() {
		let caller: T::AccountId = whitelisted_caller();
		#[extrinsic_call]
		do_something(RawOrigin::Signed(caller), 100);

		assert_eq!(Something::<T>::get().map(|v| v.block_number), Some(100u32.into()));
	}

	#[benchmark]
	fn cause_error() {
		Something::<T>::put(CompositeStruct { block_number: 100u32.into() });
		let caller: T::AccountId = whitelisted_caller();
		#[extrinsic_call]
		cause_error(RawOrigin::Signed(caller));

		assert_eq!(Something::<T>::get().map(|v| v.block_number), Some(101u32.into()));
	}

	impl_benchmark_test_suite!(Template, crate::mock::new_test_ext(), crate::mock::Test);
}
```

In your benchmarking tests, employ these best practices:

- **Write custom testing functions** - the function `do_something` in the preceding example is a placeholder. Similar to writing unit tests, you must write custom functions to benchmark test your extrinsics. Access the mock runtime and use functions such as `whitelisted_caller()` to sign transactions and facilitate testing
- **Use the `#[extrinsic_call]` macro** - this macro is used when calling the extrinsic itself and is a required part of a benchmarking function. See the [`extrinsic_call`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/v2/index.html#extrinsic_call-and-block){target=\_blank} docs for more details
- **Validate extrinsic behavior** - the `assert_eq` expression ensures that the extrinsic is working properly within the benchmark context

Add the `benchmarking` module to your pallet. In the pallet `lib.rs` file add the following:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
mod benchmarking;
```

### Add Benchmarks to Runtime

Before running the benchmarking tool, you must integrate benchmarks with your runtime as follows:

1. Navigate to your `runtime/src` directory and check if a `benchmarks.rs` file exists. If not, create one. This file will contain the macro that registers all pallets for benchmarking along with their respective configurations:
    ```rust title="benchmarks.rs"
    frame_benchmarking::define_benchmarks!(
    [frame_system, SystemBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_parachain_template, TemplatePallet]
    [pallet_balances, Balances]
    [pallet_session, SessionBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_timestamp, Timestamp]
    [pallet_message_queue, MessageQueue]
    [pallet_sudo, Sudo]
    [pallet_collator_selection, CollatorSelection]
    [cumulus_pallet_parachain_system, ParachainSystem]
    [cumulus_pallet_xcmp_queue, XcmpQueue]
);
    ```

    For example, to add a new pallet named `pallet_parachain_template` for benchmarking, include it in the macro as shown:
    ```rust title="benchmarks.rs" hl_lines="3"
    frame_benchmarking::define_benchmarks!(
    [frame_system, SystemBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_parachain_template, TemplatePallet]
    [pallet_balances, Balances]
    [pallet_session, SessionBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_timestamp, Timestamp]
    [pallet_message_queue, MessageQueue]
    [pallet_sudo, Sudo]
    [pallet_collator_selection, CollatorSelection]
    [cumulus_pallet_parachain_system, ParachainSystem]
    [cumulus_pallet_xcmp_queue, XcmpQueue]
);
    );
    ```

    !!!warning "Updating `define_benchmarks!` macro is required"
        Any pallet that needs to be benchmarked must be included in the [`define_benchmarks!`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/macro.define_benchmarks.html){target=\_blank} macro. The CLI will only be able to access and benchmark pallets that are registered here.

2. Check your runtime's `lib.rs` file to ensure the `benchmarks` module is imported. The import should look like this:

    ```rust title="lib.rs"
    #[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
    mod benchmarks;
    ```

    The `runtime-benchmarks` feature gate ensures benchmark tests are isolated from production runtime code.

3. Enable runtime benchmarking for your pallet in `runtime/Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    runtime-benchmarks = [
  # ...
  "pallet_parachain_template/runtime-benchmarks",
]
    ```

### Run Benchmarks

You can now compile your runtime with the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag. This feature flag is crucial as the benchmarking tool will look for this feature being enabled to know when it should run benchmark tests. Follow these steps to compile the runtime with benchmarking enabled:

1. Run `build` with the feature flag included:

    ```bash
    cargo build --features runtime-benchmarks --release
    ```

2. Create a `weights.rs` file in your pallet's `src/` directory. This file will store the auto-generated weight calculations:
```bash
touch weights.rs
```

3. Before running the benchmarking tool, you'll need a template file that defines how weight information should be formatted. Download the official template from the Polkadot SDK repository and save it in your project folders for future use:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/refs/tags/polkadot-stable2412/substrate/.maintain/frame-weight-template.hbs \
--output ./pallets/benchmarking/frame-weight-template.hbs
```

4. Run the benchmarking tool to measure extrinsic weights:

    ```bash
    frame-omni-bencher v1 benchmark pallet \
    --runtime INSERT_PATH_TO_WASM_RUNTIME \
    --pallet INSERT_NAME_OF_PALLET \
    --extrinsic "" \
    --template ./frame-weight-template.hbs \
    --output weights.rs
    ```

    !!! tip "Flag definitions"
        - `--runtime` - the path to your runtime's Wasm
        - `--pallet` - the name of the pallet you wish to benchmark. This pallet must be configured in your runtime and defined in `define_benchmarks`
        - `--extrinsic` - which extrinsic to test. Using `""` implies all extrinsics will be benchmarked
        - `--template` - defines how weight information should be formatted
        - `--output` - where the output of the auto-generated weights will reside

The generated `weights.rs` file contains weight annotations for your extrinsics, ready to be added to your pallet. The output should be similar to the following. Some output is omitted for brevity:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>frame-omni-bencher v1 benchmark pallet \</span>
  <span data-ty>--runtime INSERT_PATH_TO_WASM_RUNTIME \</span>
  <span data-ty>--pallet "INSERT_NAME_OF_PALLET" \</span>
  <span data-ty>--extrinsic "" \</span>
  <span data-ty>--template ./frame-weight-template.hbs \</span>
  <span data-ty>--output ./weights.rs</span>
  <span data-ty>...</span>
  <span data-ty>2025-01-15T16:41:33.557045Z INFO polkadot_sdk_frame::benchmark::pallet: [ 0 % ] Starting benchmark: pallet_parachain_template::do_something</span>
  <span data-ty>2025-01-15T16:41:33.564644Z INFO polkadot_sdk_frame::benchmark::pallet: [ 50 % ] Starting benchmark: pallet_parachain_template::cause_error</span>
  <span data-ty>...</span>
  <span data-ty>Created file: "weights.rs"</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

#### Add Benchmark Weights to Pallet

Once the `weights.rs` is generated, you must integrate it with your pallet. 

1. To begin the integration, import the `weights` module and the `WeightInfo` trait, then add both to your pallet's `Config` trait. Complete the following steps to set up the configuration:

```rust title="lib.rs"
pub mod weights;
use crate::weights::WeightInfo;

/// Configure the pallet by specifying the parameters and types on which it depends.
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    // ...
    /// A type representing the weights required by the dispatchables of this pallet.
    type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
}
```

2. Next, you must add this to the `#[pallet::weight]` annotation in all the extrinsics via the `Config` as follows:

```rust hl_lines="2" title="lib.rs"
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::do_something())]
pub fn do_something(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo { Ok(()) }
```

3. Finally, configure the actual weight values in your runtime. In `runtime/src/config/mod.rs`, add the following code:

```rust title="mod.rs"
// Configure pallet.
impl pallet_parachain_template::Config for Runtime {
    // ...
    type WeightInfo = pallet_parachain_template::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
}
```

# Mock Runtime

## Introduction

Testing is essential in Polkadot SDK development to ensure your blockchain operates as intended and effectively handles various potential scenarios. This guide walks you through setting up an environment to test pallets within the [runtime](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#runtime){target=_blank}, allowing you to evaluate how different pallets, their configurations, and system components interact to ensure reliable blockchain functionality.

## Configuring a Mock Runtime

### Testing Module

The mock runtime includes all the necessary pallets and configurations needed for testing. To ensure proper testing, you must create a module that integrates all components, enabling assessment of interactions between pallets and system elements.


Here's a simple example of how to create a testing module that simulates these interactions:

```rust
pub mod tests {
    use crate::*;
    // ...
}
```

The `crate::*;` snippet imports all the components from your crate (including runtime configurations, pallet modules, and utility functions) into the `tests` module. This allows you to write tests without manually importing each piece, making the code more concise and readable. You can opt to instead create a separate `mock.rs` file to define the configuration for your mock runtime and a companion `tests.rs` file to house the specific logic for each test.

Once the testing module is configured, you can craft your mock runtime using the [`frame_support::runtime`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/attr.runtime.html){target=\_blank} macro. This macro allows you to define a runtime environment that will be created for testing purposes:

```rust
pub mod tests {
    use crate::*;

    #[frame_support::runtime]
    mod runtime {
        #[runtime::runtime]
        #[runtime::derive(
            RuntimeCall,
            RuntimeEvent,
            RuntimeError,
            RuntimeOrigin,
            RuntimeFreezeReason,
            RuntimeHoldReason,
            RuntimeSlashReason,
            RuntimeLockId,
            RuntimeTask
        )]
        pub struct Test;

        #[runtime::pallet_index(0)]
        pub type System = frame_system::Pallet<Test>;

        // Other pallets...
    }
}
```
### Genesis Storage

The next step is configuring the genesis storage—the initial state of your runtime. Genesis storage sets the starting conditions for the runtime, defining how pallets are configured before any blocks are produced. You can only customize the initial state only of those items that implement the [`[pallet::genesis_config]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.genesis_config.html){target=\_blank} and [`[pallet::genesis_build]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.genesis_build.html){target=\_blank} macros within their respective pallets.

In Polkadot SDK, you can create this storage using the [`BuildStorage`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_runtime/trait.BuildStorage.html){target=\_blank} trait from the [`sp_runtime`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_runtime){target=\_blank} crate. This trait is essential for building the configuration that initializes the blockchain's state. 

The function `new_test_ext()` demonstrates setting up this environment. It uses `frame_system::GenesisConfig::<Test>::default()` to generate a default genesis configuration for the runtime, followed by `.build_storage()` to create the initial storage state. This storage is then converted into a format usable by the testing framework, [`sp_io::TestExternalities`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_io/type.TestExternalities.html){target=\_blank}, allowing tests to be executed in a simulated blockchain environment.

Here's the code that sets the genesis storage configuration:

```rust
pub mod tests {
    use crate::*;
    use sp_runtime::BuildStorage;

    #[frame_support::runtime]
    mod runtime {
        #[runtime::runtime]
        #[runtime::derive(
            RuntimeCall,
            RuntimeEvent,
            RuntimeError,
            RuntimeOrigin,
            RuntimeFreezeReason,
            RuntimeHoldReason,
            RuntimeSlashReason,
            RuntimeLockId,
            RuntimeTask
        )]
        pub struct Test;

        #[runtime::pallet_index(0)]
        pub type System = frame_system::Pallet<Test>;

        // Other pallets...
    }

    pub fn new_test_ext() -> sp_io::TestExternalities {
        frame_system::GenesisConfig::<Test>::default()
            .build_storage()
            .unwrap()
            .into()
    }
}
```

You can also customize the genesis storage to set initial values for your runtime pallets. For example, you can set the initial balance for accounts like this:

```rust
// Build genesis storage according to the runtime's configuration
pub fn new_test_ext() -> sp_io::TestExternalities {
    // Define the initial balances for accounts
    let initial_balances: Vec<(AccountId32, u128)> = vec![
        (AccountId32::from([0u8; 32]), 1_000_000_000_000),
        (AccountId32::from([1u8; 32]), 2_000_000_000_000),
    ];

    let mut t = frame_system::GenesisConfig::<Test>::default()
        .build_storage()
        .unwrap();

    // Adding balances configuration to the genesis config
    pallet_balances::GenesisConfig::<Test> {
        balances: initial_balances,
    }
    .assimilate_storage(&mut t)
    .unwrap();

    t.into()
}
```

For a more idiomatic approach, see the [Your First Pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/guides/your_first_pallet/index.html#better-test-setup){target=\_blank} guide from the Polkadot SDK Rust documentation.

### Pallet Configuration

Each pallet in the mocked runtime requires an associated configuration, specifying the types and values it depends on to function. These configurations often use basic or primitive types (e.g., u32, bool) instead of more complex types like structs or traits, ensuring the setup remains straightforward and manageable.

```rust
#[derive_impl(frame_system::config_preludes::TestDefaultConfig)]
impl frame_system::Config for Test {
    ...
    type Index = u64;
    type BlockNumber = u64;
    type Hash = H256;
    type Hashing = BlakeTwo256;
    type AccountId = u64;
    ...
}

impl pallet_template::Config for Test {
	type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
	type WeightInfo = ();
    ...
}
```

The configuration should be set for each pallet existing in the mocked runtime. The simplification of types is for simplifying the testing process. For example, `AccountId` is `u64`, meaning a valid account address can be an unsigned integer:

```rust
let alice_account: u64 = 1;
```

## Where to Go Next

With the mock environment in place, developers can now test and explore how pallets interact and ensure they work seamlessly together.

# Pallet Testing

## Introduction

Unit testing in the Polkadot SDK helps ensure that the functions provided by a pallet behave as expected. It also confirms that data and events associated with a pallet are processed correctly during interactions. The Polkadot SDK offers a set of APIs to create a test environment to simulate runtime and mock transaction execution for extrinsics and queries.

To begin unit testing, you must first set up a mock runtime that simulates blockchain behavior, incorporating the necessary pallets. For a deeper understanding, consult the [Mock Runtime](/develop/parachains/testing/mock-runtime/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Writing Unit Tests

Once the mock runtime is in place, the next step is to write unit tests that evaluate the functionality of your pallet. Unit tests allow you to test specific pallet features in isolation, ensuring that each function behaves correctly under various conditions. These tests typically reside in your pallet module's `test.rs` file.

Unit tests in the Polkadot SDK use the Rust testing framework, and the mock runtime you've defined earlier will serve as the test environment. Below are the typical steps involved in writing unit tests for a pallet.

The tests confirm that:

- **Pallets initialize correctly** - at the start of each test, the system should initialize with block number 0, and the pallets should be in their default states
- **Pallets modify each other's state** - the second test shows how one pallet can trigger changes in another pallet's internal state, confirming proper cross-pallet interactions
- **State transitions between blocks are seamless** - by simulating block transitions, the tests validate that the runtime responds correctly to changes in the block number

Testing pallet interactions within the runtime is critical for ensuring the blockchain behaves as expected under real-world conditions. Writing integration tests allows validation of how pallets function together, preventing issues that might arise when the system is fully assembled.

This approach provides a comprehensive view of the runtime's functionality, ensuring the blockchain is stable and reliable.

### Test Initialization

Each test starts by initializing the runtime environment, typically using the `new_test_ext()` function, which sets up the mock storage and environment.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_pallet_functionality() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        // Test logic goes here
    });
}
```

### Function Call Testing

Call the pallet's extrinsics or functions to simulate user interaction or internal logic. Use the `assert_ok!` macro to check for successful execution and `assert_err!` to verify that errors are correctly handled.

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works_for_valid_input() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        // Call an extrinsic or function
        assert_ok!(TemplateModule::some_function(Origin::signed(1), valid_param));
    });
}

#[test]
fn it_fails_for_invalid_input() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        // Call an extrinsic with invalid input and expect an error
        assert_err!(
            TemplateModule::some_function(Origin::signed(1), invalid_param),
            Error::<Test>::InvalidInput
        );
    });
}
```

### Storage Testing

After calling a function or extrinsic in your pallet, it's essential to verify that the state changes in the pallet's storage match the expected behavior to ensure data is updated correctly based on the actions taken.

The following example shows how to test the storage behavior before and after the function call:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_storage_update_on_extrinsic_call() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        // Check the initial storage state (before the call)
        assert_eq!(Something::<Test>::get(), None);

        // Dispatch a signed extrinsic, which modifies storage
        assert_ok!(TemplateModule::do_something(RuntimeOrigin::signed(1), 42));

        // Validate that the storage has been updated as expected (after the call)
        assert_eq!(Something::<Test>::get(), Some(42));
    });
}
```

### Event Testing

It's also crucial to test the events that your pallet emits during execution. By default, events generated in a pallet using the [`#generate_deposit`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.generate_deposit.html){target=\_blank} macro are stored under the system's event storage key (system/events) as [`EventRecord`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/struct.EventRecord.html){target=\_blank} entries. These can be accessed using [`System::events()`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.events){target=\_blank} or verified with specific helper methods provided by the system pallet, such as [`assert_has_event`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.assert_has_event){target=\_blank} and [`assert_last_event`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.assert_last_event){target=\_blank}.

Here's an example of testing events in a mock runtime:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_emits_events_on_success() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        // Call an extrinsic or function
        assert_ok!(TemplateModule::some_function(Origin::signed(1), valid_param));

        // Verify that the expected event was emitted
        assert!(System::events().iter().any(|record| {
            record.event == Event::TemplateModule(TemplateEvent::SomeEvent)
        }));
    });
}
```

Some key considerations are:

- **Block number** - events are not emitted on the genesis block, so you need to set the block number using [`System::set_block_number()`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.set_block_number){target=\_blank} to ensure events are triggered
- **Converting events** - use `.into()` when instantiating your pallet's event to convert it into a generic event type, as required by the system's event storage

# EVM

The Polkadot ecosystem supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts through both native EVM contracts and EVM-compatible parachains. Native EVM contracts are designed to run on Polkadot's Ethereum-compatible virtual machine, PolkaVM, which natively supports Ethereum's EVM. This allows Polkadot to execute Solidity-based contracts directly within its ecosystem without relying on external Ethereum networks or EVM-compatible parachains.

With EVM support, developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) using familiar tools, languages like Solidity, and established smart contract standards, all while taking advantage of Polkadot's unique features, such as scalability and cross-chain interoperability.

# Native EVM Contracts

## Introduction

The Asset Hub parachain is the cornerstone of asset management within the Polkadot ecosystem, providing seamless, secure access to digital assets. Native EVM contracts allow developers to deploy Solidity-based smart contracts directly on Asset Hub, enhancing developer efficiency and simplifying application design. This approach eliminates the complexity of asynchronous cross-chain communication and avoids the overhead of additional governance systems or tokens.

This guide will help you understand the role of native EVM contracts and how they integrate with the Polkadot ecosystem. You will explore the components powering this functionality, including PolkaVM and Revive, and learn how to deploy and interact with smart contracts on Asset Hub using tools like MetaMask, Revive Remix, and Ethers.js.

By enabling native smart contract deployment, Polkadot's Asset Hub streamlines blockchain development while preserving its secure, scalable foundation.

## Components

The native EVM contracts feature leverages several powerful components to deliver high performance and Solidity compatibility:

- [**`pallet_revive`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} - a runtime module that executes smart contracts by adding extrinsics, runtime APIs, and logic to convert Ethereum-style transactions into formats compatible with the blockchain. The workflow is as follows: 

    - Transactions are sent via a proxy server emulating Ethereum JSON RPC
    - The proxy converts Ethereum transactions into a special dispatchable, leaving the payload intact 
    - The pallet's logic decodes and transforms these transactions into a format compatible with the blockchain

    Using a proxy avoids modifying the node binary, ensuring compatibility with alternative clients without requiring additional implementation.

- [**PolkaVM**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm){target=\_blank} - a custom virtual machine optimized for performance with RISC-V-based architecture, supporting Solidity and additional high-performance languages

- [**Revive**](https://github.com/paritytech/revive){target=\_blank} - compiles Solidity for PolkaVM by translating the solc compiler's [YUL](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html){target=\_blank} output into RISC-V. This translation simplifies development and ensures full compatibility with all Solidity versions and features

- [**Revive Remix**](https://github.com/paritytech/revive-remix){target=\_blank} - a modified fork of Remix IDE supporting backend compilation via LLVM-based Revive. Allows for efficient Solidity contract deployment on Polkadot

## PolkaVM

PolkaVM is a cutting-edge virtual machine tailored to optimize smart contract execution on Polkadot. Unlike traditional Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM), PolkaVM is built with a RISC-V-based register architecture and a 64-bit word size, enabling:

- Faster arithmetic operations and efficient hardware translation
- Seamless integration of high-performance languages like C and Rust for advanced optimization
- Improved scalability for modern blockchain applications

### Compared to Traditional EVMs

- **Architecture** - PolkaVM's register-based design offers significant performance improvements over Ethereum's stack-based EVM. It allows for faster compilation times and aligns better with modern hardware, reducing bottlenecks in contract execution
- **Gas modeling** - PolkaVM employs a multi-dimensional gas model, metering resources like computation time, storage, and proof sizes. This ensures more accurate cost assessments for contract execution, reducing overcharging for memory allocation and enabling efficient cross-contract calls
- **Compatibility** - while optimized for performance, PolkaVM remains compatible with Ethereum tools through a closely mirrored RPC interface, with minor adjustments for certain operations. It also hides the existential deposit requirement, simplifying user interactions by abstracting balance limitations

### Performance Benefits

PolkaVM's innovations translate into significant performance gains, such as:

- **Enhanced developer experience** - faster execution and better tooling support
- **Optimized resource use** - reduced transaction costs with precise metering
- **Broader language support** - potential integration of languages like Rust and C for specialized use cases

By combining advanced performance optimizations with Ethereum compatibility, PolkaVM bridges the gap between cutting-edge blockchain development and the familiar tools developers rely on.

## Deploy a Smart Contract to Asset Hub

The following sections guide you through the steps to connect to Asset Hub, deploy a smart contract, and interact with the contract using Ethers.js.

### Connect to Asset Hub

Install any EVM-compatible wallet. To follow this example, install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/download/){target=\_blank} and add the Westend TestNet Asset Hub as a custom network using the following settings:

- **Network name** - `Asset-Hub Westend Testnet`
- **RPC URL** - `https://westend-asset-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io`
- **Chain ID** - `420420421`
- **Currency symbol** - `WND`
- **Block explorer URL** - [`https://assethub-westend.subscan.io`](https://assethub-westend.subscan.io){target=\_blank}

### Deploy a Contract

To deploy a contract to the Westend Asset Hub, you must get WND tokens. To do so, you can use the [Westend Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/westend?parachain=1000){target=\_blank}. You need to specify the address where you want to receive the tokens from the faucet.

For deploying and interacting with contracts in [Revive Remix](https://remix.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the Remix IDE, select any Solidity contract available, and compile it using the **▶️** button or the **Solidity Compiler** tab

    ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/native-evm-contracts/native-evm-contracts-1.webp)

2. Deploy the contract
    1. Click on the **Deploy & Run** tab
    2. Choose the **Westend TestNet - Metamask** button. Your account address and balance will appear in the **ACCOUNT** field
    3. Click on the **Deploy** button to launch the contract

        ![](/images/develop/smart-contracts/native-evm-contracts/native-evm-contracts-2.webp)

After deployment, you can interact with the contract listed in the **Deployed/Unpinned Contracts** section within the **Deploy & Run** tab. You can either call the smart contract methods or run tests against the contract to see if it works as expected.

### Use Ethers.js to Interact

Once deployed, you can use the [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank} library to allow your application to interact with the contract. This library provides the tools needed to query data, send transactions, and listen to events through a provider, which links your application and the blockchain.

- In browsers, providers are available through wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank}, which inject an `ethereum` object into the `window`. Ensure that Metamask is installed and connected to Westend Asset Hub

    ```js
    import { BrowserProvider } from 'ethers';

// Browser wallet will inject the ethereum object into the window object
if (typeof window.ethereum == 'undefined') {
  return console.log('No wallet installed');
}

console.log('An Ethereum wallet is installed!');
const provider = new BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
    ```

- For server-side applications, `JsonRpcProvider` can connect directly to RPC nodes:

    ```js
    import { JsonRpcProvider } from 'ethers';

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(
  'https://westend-asset-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io',
);
    ```

Once your application is connected, you can retrieve network data, access contract methods, and fully interact with the deployed smart contract.

# Parachain Contracts

## Introduction

One key factor underpinning Ethereum's growth is the ease of deploying to the EVM. The EVM, or Ethereum Virtual Machine, provides developers with a consistent and predictable execution environment for smart contracts. While the EVM is not perfect, its popularity and ease of deployment have far outweighed any shortcomings and resulted in the massive growth of EVM-compatible smart contract platforms.

Also integral to the proliferation of EVM-based smart contract networks is smart contract portability. Developers can take their smart contracts that they've deployed to Ethereum, and in many cases, deploy them to other EVM-compatible networks with minimal changes. More than "Copy/Paste" deployments, this enables chains' interoperability. Building a cross-chain application is much easier when both chains offer similar EVM compatibility.

## Why Adopt the EVM as a Polkadot Parachain?

In addition to the developer mindshare of the EVM, Polkadot parachains leveraging the EVM can benefit from the extensive tooling for Ethereum developers that's already been built and battle-tested. This includes wallets, block explorers, developer tools, and more. Beyond just tools, the EVM has had a long headstart regarding smart contract auditors and institutional/custodial asset management. Integrating EVM compatibility can unlock several of these tools by default or allow for relatively easy future integrations.

Polkadot enables parachains to supercharge the capabilities of their parachain beyond just the limitations of the EVM. To that end, many parachains have developed ways to tap into the powerful features offered by Polkadot, such as through precompiles or solidity interfaces that expose Substrate functionality to app developers and users. This guide will cover some of the unique features that each parachain offers. For more information about each parachain, visit the documentation site for the respective parachain.  

## EVM-Compatible Parachains

### Astar

[Astar](https://astar.network/){target=\_blank} emerged as a key smart contract platform on Polkadot, distinguished by its unique multiple virtual machine approach that supports both EVM and WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts. This dual VM support allows developers to choose their preferred programming environment while maintaining full Ethereum compatibility. The platform's [runtime](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar){target=\_blank} is built on Substrate using FRAME, incorporating crucial components from Polkadot-SDK alongside custom-built modules for handling its unique features.

Astar has established itself as an innovation hub through initiatives like the zk-rollup development framework and integration with multiple Layer 2 scaling solutions. Astar leverages [XCM](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank} for native Polkadot ecosystem interoperability while maintaining connections to external networks through various bridge protocols. Through its support for both EVM and Wasm, along with advanced cross-chain capabilities, Astar serves as a crucial gateway for projects looking to leverage the unique advantages of both Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems while maintaining seamless interoperability between them.

The diagram illustrates the layered architecture of Astar Network: at the top, dApps can interact with the Astar network through either Web3, Substrate, or Wasm. These requests flow through Astar's RPC layer into the main runtime, where the magic happens in the virtual machine layer. Here, Astar's unique Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM) coordinates between EVM and Wasm environments, allowing smart contracts from both ecosystems to interact. The Runtime also includes core blockchain functions through various pallets (like system operations and dApps staking), and everything is ultimately secured by connecting to the Polkadot Relay Chain at the bottom layer.

### Moonbeam

[Moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/){target=\_blank} was the first parachain to bring full Ethereum-compatibility to Polkadot, enabling Ethereum developers to bring their dApps to Polkadot and gain access to the rapidly growing Polkadot user base. [Moonbeam's runtime](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam){target=\_blank} is built using [FRAME](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/overview/#frame-runtime-architecture){target=\_blank}, and combines essential components from the Polkadot-SDK, Frontier, and custom pallets. The architecture integrates key Substrate offerings like balance management and transaction processing, while [Frontier's](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} pallets enable EVM execution and Ethereum compatibility. Custom pallets handle Moonbeam-specific features such as parachain staking and block author verification. Moonbeam offers a variety of precompiles for dApp developers to access powerful Polkadot features via a Solidity interface, such as governance, randomness, transaction batching, and more.

Additionally, Moonbeam is a hub for interoperability and cross-chain connected contracts. Moonbeam has a variety of integrations with GMP (general message passing) providers, including [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/){target=\_blank}, [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/){target=\_blank}, [Axelar](https://www.axelar.network/){target=\_blank}, and more. These integrations make it easy for developers to build cross-chain contracts on Moonbeam, and they also play an integral role in connecting the entire Polkadot ecosystem with other blockchains. Innovations like [Moonbeam Routed Liquidity](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/interoperability/mrl/){target=\_blank}, or MRL, enable users to bridge funds between chains like Ethereum and parachains like HydraDX. Through [XCM](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank}, other parachains can connect to Moonbeam and access its established bridge connections to Ethereum and other networks, eliminating the need for each parachain to build and maintain their own bridges.

The diagram above illustrates how transactions are processed on Moonbeam. When a DApp or Ethereum development tool (like Hardhat) sends a Web3 RPC request, it's first received by a Moonbeam node. Moonbeam nodes are versatile - they support both Web3 and Substrate RPCs, giving developers the flexibility to use either Ethereum or Substrate tools. When these RPC calls come in, they're processed by corresponding functions in the Substrate runtime. The runtime verifies signatures and processes any Substrate extrinsics. Finally, if the transaction involves smart contracts, these are forwarded to Moonbeam's EVM for execution and state changes.

### Acala

[Acala](https://acala.network/){target=\_blank} positioned itself as Polkadot's DeFi hub by introducing the [Acala EVM+](https://evmdocs.acala.network/){target=\_blank} - an enhanced version of the EVM specifically optimized for DeFi operations. This customized EVM implementation enables seamless deployment of Ethereum-based DeFi protocols while offering advanced features like on-chain scheduling, pre-built DeFi primitives, and native multi-token support that aren't available in traditional EVMs.

Acala supports a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem including a decentralized stablecoin (aUSD) and a liquid staking derivative for DOT. The platform's EVM+ innovations extend beyond standard Ethereum compatibility by enabling direct interaction between EVM smart contracts and Substrate pallets, facilitating advanced cross-chain DeFi operations through [XCM](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank}, and providing built-in oracle integrations. These enhancements make it possible for DeFi protocols to achieve functionality that would be prohibitively expensive or technically infeasible on traditional EVM chains.

The diagram illustrates Acala's unique EVM+ architecture, which extends beyond standard EVM compatibility. At the top, DApps can interact with the network using either Ethereum tools (via Web3 and bodhi.js) or Substrate tools. These requests flow through Acala's dual RPC layer into the main Runtime. The key differentiator is the EVM+ environment, which includes special features like the Storage Meter for rent management, and numerous precompiled contracts (like DEX, Oracle, Schedule) that provide native Substrate functionality to EVM contracts. All of this runs on top of Polkadot's shared security as a parachain.

## EVM Developer Tools

One of the key benefits of being an EVM-compatible parachain the ability for developers to use familiar developer tools, like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank}, [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank}, and [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry){target=\_blank}. Being compatible with the most widely adopted smart contract programming language, Solidity, means that developers can leverage existing smart contract templates and standards, such as the ones built by [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/solidity-contracts){target=\_blank}.

## Reading Contract State on EVM-Compatible Parachains

The following section will dive into a practical demonstration. The following script showcases how to interact with multiple Polkadot parachains using their EVM compatibility. This script will query:

- Moonbeam for its Wormhole USDC total supply
- Acala for its native ACA token supply using a precompile
- Astar for its USDC total supply

What makes this demo particularly powerful is that all three chains—Astar, Moonbeam, and Acala—share EVM compatibility. This means you can use a single, unified script to query token balances across all chains, simply by adjusting the RPC endpoints and token contract addresses. Thanks to EVM-compatibility, there's no need for chain-specific scripts or custom development work.

  moonbeam: {

  },
  astar: {
    rpc: 'https://evm.astar.network',
    name: 'Astar (USDC)',
  },
};

// Minimal ERC20 ABI - we only need totalSupply
const erc20ABI = [

  try {
    // Get network configuration
    const networkConfig = networkConfigs[networkKey];
    if (!networkConfig) {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported network: ${networkKey}`);
    }

    // Create provider and contract instance - Updated for ethers v6
    const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(networkConfig.rpc);
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, erc20ABI, provider);

    // Get total supply and decimals
    const [totalSupply, decimals] = await Promise.all([
      contract.totalSupply(),
      contract.decimals(),
    ]);

    // Convert to human readable format
    const formattedSupply = ethers.formatUnits(totalSupply, decimals);

    return {
      network: networkConfig.name,
      tokenAddress,
      totalSupply: formattedSupply,
      rawTotalSupply: totalSupply.toString(),
      decimals: decimals,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Error fetching token supply: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

async function main() {
  const tokens = {
    moonbeam: '0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c', // Wormhole USDC
    acala: '0x0000000000000000000100000000000000000000', // ACA
    astar: '0x6a2d262D56735DbA19Dd70682B39F6bE9a931D98', // USDC on Astar
  };

  for (const [network, tokenAddress] of Object.entries(tokens)) {
    try {
      const result = await getTokenSupply(network, tokenAddress);
      console.log(`\n${result.network} Token Supply:`);
      console.log(`Address: ${result.tokenAddress}`);
      console.log(`Total Supply: ${result.totalSupply}`);
      console.log(`Decimals: ${result.decimals}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error for ${network}:`, error.message);
    }
  }
}

// Execute the main function and handle any errors
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error in main:', error);
  process.exit(1);
});
    ```

This script demonstrates one of the fundamental ways to interact with blockchain networks - querying on-chain state through smart contract calls.  The standardized ERC20 interface (which most tokens implement) is used to read the total supply of tokens across different EVM networks. This type of interaction is "read-only" or a "view" call, meaning it is simply fetching data from the blockchain without making any transactions or state changes. Therefore, it isn't using any gas. Transactions that attempt to make a state change to the blockchain require gas.  The ability to query state like this is essential for DApps, analytics tools, and monitoring systems that need real-time blockchain data.

# Smart Contracts

Polkadot offers developers flexibility in building smart contracts, supporting both Wasm-based contracts using ink! (written in Rust) and Solidity contracts executed by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

This section guides you through the tools, resources, and guides to help you build and deploy smart contracts using either Wasm/ink! or EVM-based parachains, depending on your language and environment preference.

## Choosing the Right Smart Contract Language and Execution Environment

For developers building smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem, the choice between parachains supporting ink! (for Wasm contracts) and EVM-compatible parachains (for Solidity contracts) depend on the preferred development environment and language. By selecting the right parachain, developers can leverage Polkadot's scalability and interoperability while utilizing the framework that best suits their needs.

!!! tip
    Significant advancements in Polkadot's native smart contract functionality are in active development. Frequent changes should be expected. See this [Contracts on AssetHub Roadmap](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/contracts-on-assethub-roadmap/9513/57){target=\_blank} Polkadot Network Forum post for updates.

Here are some key considerations:

- [**Wasm (ink!) contracts**](/develop/smart-contracts/wasm-ink/){target=\_blank} - contracts are written in Rust and compiled to Wasm. The advantage of Wasm is that it allows for more flexibility, speed, and potentially lower execution costs compared to EVM, especially in the context of Polkadot's multi-chain architecture
- [**EVM-compatible contracts**](/develop/smart-contracts/evm/parachain-contracts/){target=\_blank} - contracts are written in languages like Solidity or Vyper and executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is widely standardized across blockchains, including Polkadot parachains like Astar, Moonbeam, and Acala. This compatibility allows contracts to be deployed across multiple networks with minimal modifications, benefiting from a well-established, broad development ecosystem

<!-- This content is temporarily hidden and has been commented out to ensure it is preserved. -->
<!-- - [**PolkaVM-compatible contracts**](/develop/smart-contracts/evm/native-evm-contracts/){target=\_blank} - contracts are written in languages like Solidity or Vyper and executed by the PolkaVM. This compatibility provides a seamless transition for developers coming from EVM environments while also enabling interactions with other Polkadot parachains and leveraging Polkadot's interoperability -->

Throughout the pages in this section, you'll find resources and guides to help you get started with developing smart contracts in both environments.

# An Overview of the Smart Contract Landscape on Polkadot

## Introduction

Polkadot is designed to support an ecosystem of parachains, rather than hosting smart contracts directly. Developers aiming to build smart contract applications on Polkadot rely on parachains within the ecosystem that provide smart contract functionality.

This guide outlines the primary approaches to developing smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem:

- **Wasm-based smart contracts** - using [ink!](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank}, a Rust-based embedded domain-specific language (eDSL), enabling developers to leverage Rust’s safety and tooling
- **EVM-compatible contracts** - which support languages like [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} and [Vyper](https://vyperlang.org/){target=\_blank}, offering compatibility with popular Ethereum tools and wallets
<!-- This content is temporarily hidden and has been commented out to ensure it is preserved. -->
<!-- - **PolkaVM-compatible contracts** - which support Solidity and Rust while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum based tools -->

You'll explore the key differences between these development paths, along with considerations for parachain developers integrating smart contract functionality.

If you are a parachain developer looking to add smart contract functionality to your chain, please refer to the [Add Smart Contract Functionality](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/add-smart-contract-functionality/){target=\_blank} page, which covers both Wasm and EVM-based contract implementations.

## Smart Contracts Versus Parachains

A smart contract is a program that executes specific logic isolated to the chain on which it is being executed. All the logic executed is bound to the same state transition rules determined by the underlying virtual machine (VM). Consequently, smart contracts are more streamlined to develop, and programs can easily interact with each other through similar interfaces.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph A[Chain State]
    direction LR
    B["Program Logic and Storage<br/>(Smart Contract)"]
    C["Tx Relevant Storage"]
  end
  A --> D[[Virtual Machine]]
  E[Transaction] --> D
  D --> F[(New State)]
  D --> G[Execution Logs]
  style A fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

In addition, because smart contracts are programs that execute on top of existing chains, teams don't have to think about the underlying consensus they are built on.

These strengths do come with certain limitations. Some smart contracts environments, like EVM, tend to be immutable by default. Developers have developed different [proxy strategies](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/proxy-patterns){target=\_blank} to be able to upgrade smart contracts over time. The typical pattern relies on a proxy contract which holds the program storage forwarding a call to an implementation contract where the execution logic resides. Smart contract upgrades require changing the implementation contract while retaining the same storage structure, necessitating careful planning.

Another downside is that smart contracts often follow a gas metering model, where program execution is associated with a given unit and a marketplace is set up to pay for such an execution unit. This fee system is often very rigid, and some complex flows, like account abstraction, have been developed to circumvent this problem.

In contrast, parachains can create their own custom logics (known as pallets or modules), and combine them as the state transition function (STF or runtime) thanks to the modularity provided by the [Polkadot-SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}){target=\_blank}. The different pallets within the parachain runtime can give developers a lot of flexibility when building applications on top of it.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[(Chain State)] --> B[["STF<br/>[Pallet 1]<br/>[Pallet 2]<br/>...<br/>[Pallet N]"]]
    C[Transaction<br/>Targeting Pallet 2] --> B
    B --> E[(New State)]
    B --> F[Execution Logs]
```

Parachains inherently offer features such as logic upgradeability, flexible transaction fee mechanisms, and chain abstraction logic. More so, by using Polkadot, parachains can benefit from robust consensus guarantees with little engineering overhead.

To learn more about the differences between smart contracts and parachain runtimes, please see the [Runtime vs. Smart Contracts](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/runtime_vs_smart_contract/index.html){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot SDK Rust docs. For a more in-depth discussion on choosing between runtime development and smart contract development, see the post ["When should one build a Polkadot SDK runtime versus a Substrate (Polkadot SDK) smart contract?"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56041305){target=\_blank} from Stack Overflow.

## Building a Smart Contract

Polkadot's primary purpose is to provide security for parachains that connect to it. Therefore, it is not meant to support smart contract execution. Developers looking to build smart contract projects in Polkadot need to look into its ecosystem for parachains that support it.

The Polkadot SDK supports multiple smart contract execution environments:

- **EVM** - through [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank}. It consists of a full Ethereum JSON RPC compatible client, an Ethereum emulation layer, and a [Rust-based EVM](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm){target=\_blank}. This is used by chains like [Acala](https://acala.network/){target=\_blank}, [Astar](https://astar.network/){target=\_blank}, [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} and more
- **Wasm** - through the [Contracts pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/contracts/){target=\_blank}. [ink!](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank} is a smart contract language that provides a compiler to Wasm. Wasm contracts can be used by chains like [Astar](https://astar.network/){target=\_blank}
<!-- This content is temporarily hidden and has been commented out to ensure it is preserved. -->
<!-- - **PolkaVM** - a cutting-edge virtual machine tailored to optimize smart contract execution on Polkadot. Unlike traditional EVMs, PolkaVM is built with a [RISC-V-based register architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V){target=\_blank} for increased performance and scalability -->

### EVM Contracts

The [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} project provides a set of modules that enables a Polkadot SDK-based chain to run an Ethereum emulation layer that allows the execution of EVM smart contracts natively with the same API/RPC interface.

[Ethereum addresses (ECDSA)](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#address){target=\_blank} can also be mapped directly to and from the Polkadot SDK's SS58 scheme from existing accounts. Moreover, you can modify Polkadot SDK to use the ECDSA signature scheme directly to avoid any mapping.

At a high level, [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} is composed of three main components:

- [**Ethereum Client**](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/client){target=\_blank} - an Ethereum JSON RPC compliant client that allows any request coming from an Ethereum tool, such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank} or [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank}, to be admitted by the network
- [**Pallet Ethereum**](https://docs.rs/pallet-ethereum/latest/pallet_ethereum/){target=\_blank} - a block emulation and Ethereum transaction validation layer that works jointly with the Ethereum client to ensure compatibility with Ethereum tools
- [**Pallet EVM**](https://docs.rs/pallet-evm/latest/pallet_evm/){target=\_blank} - access layer to the [Rust-based EVM](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm){target=\_blank}, enabling the execution of EVM smart contract logic natively

Broadly speaking, in this configuration, an EVM transaction follows the path presented in the diagram below:

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Users and Devs] -->|Send Tx| B[Frontier RPC Ext]
    subgraph C[Pallet Ethereum]
        D[Validate Tx]

Although it seems complex, users and developers are abstracted of that complexity, and tools can easily interact with the parachain as they would with any other EVM-compatible environment.

The Rust EVM is capable of executing regular [EVM bytecode](https://www.ethervm.io/){target=\_blank}. Consequently, any language that compiles to EVM bytecode can be used to create programs that the parachain can execute.

### Wasm Contracts

The [`pallet_contracts`](https://docs.rs/pallet-contracts/latest/pallet_contracts/index.html#contracts-pallet){target=\_blank} provides the execution environment for Wasm-based smart contracts. Consequently, any smart contract language that compiles to Wasm can be executed in a parachain that enables this module.

At the time of writing there are two main languages that can be used for Wasm programs:

- [**ink!**](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank} - it is a Rust-based language that compiles to Wasm. It allows developers to inherit all its safety guarantees and use normal Rust tooling, being the dedicated domain-specific language
- **Solidity** - it can be compiled to Wasm via the [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang/){target=\_blank} compiler. Consequently, developers can write Solidity 0.8 smart contracts that can be executed as Wasm programs in parachains

Broadly speaking, with [`pallet_contracts`](https://docs.rs/pallet-contracts/latest/pallet_contracts/index.html#contracts-pallet){target=\_blank}, a transaction follows the path presented in the diagram below:

``` mermaid

# Wasm (ink!)

## Introduction

The [pallet_contracts](https://docs.rs/pallet-contracts/latest/pallet_contracts/index.html#contracts-pallet){target=\_blank} is a specialized pallet within the Polkadot SDK that enables smart contract functionality through a WebAssembly (Wasm) execution environment. For developing smart contracts for this pallet, [ink!](https://use.ink/){target=\_blank} emerges as the primary and recommended language. 

ink! is an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) designed to develop [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/){target=\_blank} smart contracts using the Rust programming language.

Rather than creating a new language, ink! is just standard Rust in a well-defined "contract format" with specialized `#[ink(…)]` attribute macros. These attribute macros tell ink! what the different parts of your Rust smart contract represent and ultimately allow ink! to do all the magic needed to create Polkadot SDK-compatible Wasm bytecode. Because of this, it inherits critical advantages such as:

- Strong memory safety guarantees
- Advanced type system
- Comprehensive development tooling
- Support from Rust's extensive developer community

Since ink! smart contracts are compiled to Wasm, they offer high execution speed, platform independence, and enhanced security through sandboxed execution.

## Installation

ink! smart contract development requires the installation of [cargo-contract](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract){target=\_blank}, a command-line interface (CLI) tool that provides essential utilities for creating, testing, and managing ink! projects.

For step-by-step installation instructions, including platform-specific requirements and troubleshooting tips, refer to the official `cargo-contract` [Installation](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract?tab=readme-ov-file#installation){target=\_blank} guide.

## Get Started

To create a new ink! smart contract project, use the `cargo contract` command:

```bash
cargo contract new INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
```

This command generates a new project directory with the following structure:

```bash
INSERT_PROJECT_NAME/
├── lib.rs          # Contract source code
├── Cargo.toml      # Project configuration and dependencies
└── .gitignore      # Git ignore rules
```

The `lib.rs` file includes a basic contract template with storage and message-handling functionality. Customize this file to implement your contract’s logic. The `Cargo.toml` file defines project dependencies, including the necessary ink! libraries and configuration settings.

## Contract Structure

An ink! smart contract requires three fundamental components:

- A storage struct marked with `#[ink(storage)]`
- At least one constructor function marked with `#[ink(constructor)]`
- At least one message function marked with `#[ink(message)]`

### Default Template Structure

The following example shows the basic contract structure generated by running `cargo contract new`:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod flipper {

    /// Defines the storage of your contract.
    /// Add new fields to the below struct in order
    /// to add new static storage fields to your contract.
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Flipper {
        /// Stores a single `bool` value on the storage.
        value: bool,
    }

    impl Flipper {
        /// Constructor that initializes the `bool` value to the given `init_value`.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(init_value: bool) -> Self {
            Self { value: init_value }
        }

        /// Constructor that initializes the `bool` value to `false`.
        ///
        /// Constructors can delegate to other constructors.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn default() -> Self {
            Self::new(Default::default())
        }

        /// A message that can be called on instantiated contracts.
        /// This one flips the value of the stored `bool` from `true`
        /// to `false` and vice versa.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn flip(&mut self) {
            self.value = !self.value;
        }

        /// Simply returns the current value of our `bool`.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get(&self) -> bool {
            self.value
        }
    }
}
```

### Storage

In an ink! contract, persistent storage is defined by a single struct annotated with the `#[ink(storage)]` attribute. This struct represents the contract's state and can use various data types for storing information, such as:

- **Common data types**:

    - Boolean values (`bool`)
    - Unsigned integers (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`)
    - Signed integers (`i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`)
    - Tuples and arrays

- **Substrate-specific types**:

    - **`AccountId`** - contract and user addresses
    - **`Balance`** - token amounts
    - **`Hash`** - cryptographic hashes

- **Data structures**:

    - **Struct** - custom data structures
    - **Vec** - dynamic arrays
    - **Mapping** - key-value storage
    - **BTreeMap**- ordered maps
    - **HashMap** - unordered maps

Example of a storage struct using various supported types:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct Data {
    /// A boolean flag to indicate a certain condition
    flag: bool,
    /// A vector to store multiple entries of unsigned 32-bit integers
    entries: Vec<u32>,
    /// An optional value that can store a specific integer or none
    optional_value: Option<i32>,
    /// A map to associate keys (as AccountId) with values (as unsigned 64-bit integers)
    key_value_store: Mapping<AccountId, u64>,
    /// A counter to keep track of some numerical value
    counter: u64,
}
```

For an in-depth explanation of storage and data structures in ink!, refer to the  [Storage & Data Structures](https://use.ink/datastructures/overview){target=\_blank} section and the [`#[ink(storage)]`](https://use.ink/macros-attributes/storage){target=\_blank} macro definition in the official documentation.

### Constructors

Constructors are functions that execute once when deploying the contract and are used to initialize the contract’s state. Each contract must have at least one constructor, though multiple constructors can provide different initialization options.

Example:

```rust
#[ink::contract]
mod mycontract {

    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct MyContract {
        number: u32,
    }

    impl MyContract {
        /// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the given `init_value`.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(init_value: u32) -> Self {
            Self {
                number: init_value,
            }
        }

        /// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the `u32` default.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn default() -> Self {
            Self {
                number: Default::default(),
            }
        }
    }

    /* ... */
}
```

In this example, `new(init_value: u32)` initializes `number` with a specified value, while `default()` initializes it with the type’s default value (0 for `u32`). These constructors provide flexibility in contract deployment by supporting custom and default initialization options.

For more information, refer to the official documentation for the [`#[ink(constructor)]`](https://use.ink/macros-attributes/constructor){target=\_blank} macro definition.

### Messages

Messages are functions that interact with the contract, allowing users or other contracts to call specific methods. Each contract must define at least one message.

There are two types of messages:

- **Immutable messages (`&self`)** - these messages can only read the contract's state and cannot modify it
- **Mutable messages (`&mut self`)** - these messages can read and modify the contract's state

In the example above, `&self` is a reference to the contract's storage.

Example:

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn my_getter(&self) -> u32 {
    self.my_number
}

#[ink(message)]
pub fn my_setter(&mut self, new_value: u32) -> u32 {
    self.my_number = new_value;
}
```

In the example above, `my_getter` is an immutable message that reads state, while `my_setter` is a mutable message that updates state.

For more information, refer to the official documentation on the [`#[ink(message)]`](https://use.ink/macros-attributes/message){target=\_blank} macro.

### Errors

For defining errors, ink! uses idiomatic Rust error handling with the `Result<T,E>` type. These errors are user-defined by creating an `Error` enum and all the necessary types.
If an error is returned, the contract reverts

In ink!, errors are handled using idiomatic Rust practices with the `Result<T, E>` type. Custom error types are defined by creating an `Error` enum and specifying any necessary variants. If a message returns an error, the contract execution reverts, ensuring no changes are applied to the contract's state.

Example:

```rust
[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub enum Error {
    /// Returned if not enough balance to fulfill a request is available.
    InsufficientBalance,
    /// Returned if not enough allowance to fulfill a request is available.
    InsufficientAllowance,
}

impl Erc20 {
    //...
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn transfer_from(
        &mut self,
        from: AccountId,
        to: AccountId,
        value: Balance,
    ) -> Result<(),Error> {
        let caller = self.env().caller();
        let allowance = self.allowance_impl(&from, &caller);
        if allowance < value {
            return Err(Error::InsufficientAllowance)
        }
        //...
    }
    //...
}
```

In this example, the `Error` enum defines custom error types `InsufficientBalance` and `InsufficientAllowance`. When `transfer_from` is called, it checks if the allowance is sufficient. If not, it returns an `InsufficientAllowance` error, causing the contract to revert. This approach ensures robust error handling for smart contracts.

### Events

Events are a way of letting the outside world know about what's happening inside the contract. They are user-defined in a struct and decorated with the `#[ink(event)]` macro.

Events allow the contract to communicate important occurrences to the outside world. They are user-defined by creating a struct and annotating it with the `#[ink(event)]` macro. Each field you want to index for efficient querying should be marked with `#[ink(topic)]`.

Example:

```rust
/// Event emitted when a token transfer occurs.
#[ink(event)]
pub struct Transfer {
    #[ink(topic)]
    from: Option<AccountId>,
    #[ink(topic)]
    to: Option<AccountId>,
    value: Balance,
}

impl Erc20 {
    //...
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn transfer_from(
        &mut self,
        from: AccountId,
        to: AccountId,
        value: Balance,
    ) -> Result<(),Error> {
        //...
        self.env().emit_event(Transfer {
            from: Some(from),
            to: Some(to),
            value,
        });
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Transfer` event records the sender (`from`), the receiver (`to`), and the amount transferred (`value`). The event is emitted in the `transfer_from` function to notify external listeners whenever a transfer occurs.

For more details, check the [Events](https://use.ink/basics/events){target=\_blank} section and the [`#[ink(event)]`](https://use.ink/macros-attributes/event){target=\_blank} macro documentation.

# Polkadot-API

## Introduction

[Polkadot-API](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api){target=\_blank} (PAPI) is a set of libraries built to be modular, composable, and grounded in a “light-client first” approach. Its primary aim is to equip dApp developers with an extensive toolkit for building fully decentralized applications.

PAPI is optimized for light-client functionality, using the new JSON-RPC spec to support decentralized interactions fully. It provides strong TypeScript support with types and documentation generated directly from on-chain metadata, and it offers seamless access to storage reads, constants, transactions, events, and runtime calls. Developers can connect to multiple chains simultaneously and prepare for runtime updates through multi-descriptor generation and compatibility checks. PAPI is lightweight and performant, leveraging native BigInt, dynamic imports, and modular subpaths to avoid bundling unnecessary assets. It supports promise-based and observable-based APIs, integrates easily with Polkadot.js extensions, and offers signing options through browser extensions or private keys.

## Get Started

### API Instantiation

To instantiate the API, you can install the package by using the following command:

=== "npm"
    ```bash
    npm i polkadot-api
    ```

=== "pnpm"
    ```bash
    pnpm add polkadot-api
    ```

=== "yarn"
    ```bash
    yarn add polkadot-api
    ```

Then, obtain the latest metadata from the target chain and generate the necessary types:

```bash
# Add the target chain
npx papi add dot -n polkadot
```

The `papi add` command initializes the library by generating the corresponding types needed for the chain used. It assigns the chain a custom name and specifies downloading metadata from the Polkadot chain. You can replace `dot` with the name you prefer or with another chain if you want to add a different one. Once the latest metadata is downloaded, generate the required types:

```bash
# Generate the necessary types
npx papi
```

You can now set up a [`PolkadotClient`](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/blob/main/packages/client/src/types.ts#L153){target=\_blank} with your chosen provider to begin interacting with the API. Choose from Smoldot via WebWorker, Node.js, or direct usage, or connect through the WSS provider. The examples below show how to configure each option for your setup.

=== "Smoldot (WebWorker)"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the identifier assigned during `npx papi add`
import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
import { getSmProvider } from 'polkadot-api/sm-provider';
import { chainSpec } from 'polkadot-api/chains/polkadot';
import { startFromWorker } from 'polkadot-api/smoldot/from-worker';
import SmWorker from 'polkadot-api/smoldot/worker?worker';

const worker = new SmWorker();
const smoldot = startFromWorker(worker);
const chain = await smoldot.addChain({ chainSpec });

// Establish connection to the Polkadot relay chain
const client = createClient(getSmProvider(chain));

// To interact with the chain, obtain the `TypedApi`, which provides
// the necessary types for every API call on this chain
const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);
    ```

=== "Smoldot (Node.js)"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the alias assigned during `npx papi add`
import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
import { getSmProvider } from 'polkadot-api/sm-provider';
import { chainSpec } from 'polkadot-api/chains/polkadot';
import { startFromWorker } from 'polkadot-api/smoldot/from-node-worker';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';

// Get the path for the worker file in ESM
const workerPath = fileURLToPath(
  import.meta.resolve('polkadot-api/smoldot/node-worker'),
);

const worker = new Worker(workerPath);
const smoldot = startFromWorker(worker);
const chain = await smoldot.addChain({ chainSpec });

// Set up a client to connect to the Polkadot relay chain
const client = createClient(getSmProvider(chain));

// To interact with the chain's API, use `TypedApi` for access to
// all the necessary types and calls associated with this chain
const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);
    ```

=== "Smoldot"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the alias assigned when running `npx papi add`
import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
import { getSmProvider } from 'polkadot-api/sm-provider';
import { chainSpec } from 'polkadot-api/chains/polkadot';
import { start } from 'polkadot-api/smoldot';

// Initialize Smoldot client
const smoldot = start();
const chain = await smoldot.addChain({ chainSpec });

// Set up a client to connect to the Polkadot relay chain
const client = createClient(getSmProvider(chain));

// Access the `TypedApi` to interact with all available chain calls and types
const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);
    ```

=== "WSS"

    ```typescript
    // `dot` is the identifier assigned when executing `npx papi add`
import { dot } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
// Use this import for Node.js environments
import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider/web';
import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';

// Establish a connection to the Polkadot relay chain
const client = createClient(
  // The Polkadot SDK nodes may have compatibility issues; using this enhancer is recommended.
  // Refer to the Requirements page for additional details
  withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('wss://dot-rpc.stakeworld.io')),
);

// To interact with the chain, obtain the `TypedApi`, which provides
// the types for all available calls in that chain
const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);
    ```

Now that you have set up the client, you can interact with the chain by reading and sending transactions.

### Reading Chain Data

The `TypedApi` provides a streamlined way to read blockchain data through three main interfaces, each designed for specific data access patterns:

- **Constants** - access fixed values or configurations on the blockchain using the `constants` interface:

    ```typescript
    const version = await typedApi.constants.System.Version();
    ```

- **Storage queries** - retrieve stored values by querying the blockchain’s storage via the `query` interface:

    ```typescript
    const asset = await api.query.ForeignAssets.Asset.getValue(
      token.location,
      { at: 'best' },
    );
    ```

- **Runtime APIs** - interact directly with runtime APIs using the `apis` interface:

    ```typescript
    const metadata = await typedApi.apis.Metadata.metadata();
    ```

To learn more about the different actions you can perform with the `TypedApi`, refer to the [TypedApi reference](https://papi.how/typed){target=\_blank}.

### Sending Transactions

In PAPI, the `TypedApi` provides the `tx` and `txFromCallData` methods to send transactions. 

- The `tx` method allows you to directly send a transaction with the specified parameters by using the `typedApi.tx.Pallet.Call` pattern:

    ```typescript
    const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.Pallet.Call({arg1, arg2, arg3});
    ``` 

    For instance, to execute the `balances.transferKeepAlive` call, you can use the following snippet:

    ```typescript
    import { MultiAddress } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';

const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.Balances.transfer_keep_alive({
  dest: MultiAddress.Id('INSERT_DESTINATION_ADDRESS'),
  value: BigInt(INSERT_VALUE),
});
    ```

    Ensure you replace `INSERT_DESTINATION_ADDRESS` and `INSERT_VALUE` with the actual destination address and value, respectively.

- The `txFromCallData` method allows you to send a transaction using the call data. This option accepts binary call data and constructs the transaction from it. It validates the input upon creation and will throw an error if invalid data is provided. The pattern is as follows:

    ```typescript
    const callData = Binary.fromHex('0x...');
    const tx: Transaction = typedApi.txFromCallData(callData);
    ``` 

    For instance, to execute a transaction using the call data, you can use the following snippet:

    ```typescript
    const callData = Binary.fromHex('0x00002470617065726d6f6f6e');
    const tx: Transaction = typedApi.txFromCallData(callData);
    ```

For more information about sending transactions, refer to the [Transactions](https://papi.how/typed/tx#transactions){target=\_blank} page.

# Polkadot.js API

## Introduction

The [Polkadot.js API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api){target=\_blank} uses JavaScript/TypeScript to interact with Polkadot SDK-based chains. It allows you to query nodes, read chain state, and submit transactions through a dynamic, auto-generated API interface.

### Dynamic API Generation

Unlike traditional static APIs, the Polkadot.js API generates its interfaces automatically when connecting to a node. Here's what happens when you connect:

1. The API connects to your node
2. It retrieves the chain's metadata
3. Based on this metadata, it creates specific endpoints in this format: `api.<type>.<module>.<section>`

### Available API Categories

You can access three main categories of chain interactions:

- **[Runtime constants](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.consts){target=\_blank}** (`api.consts`)
    - Access runtime constants directly
    - Returns values immediately without function calls
    - Example - `api.consts.balances.existentialDeposit`

- **[State queries](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.query/){target=\_blank}** (`api.query`)
    - Read chain state
    - Example - `api.query.system.account(accountId)`

- **[Transactions](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.tx/){target=\_blank}** (`api.tx`)
    - Submit extrinsics (transactions)
    - Example - `api.tx.balances.transfer(accountId, value)`

The available methods and interfaces will automatically reflect what's possible on your connected chain.

## Installation

To add the Polkadot.js API to your project, use the following command to install the latest stable release which supports any Polkadot SDK-based chain:

=== "npm"
    ```bash
    npm i @polkadot/api
    ```

=== "pnpm"
    ```bash
    pnpm add @polkadot/api
    ```

=== "yarn"
    ```bash
    yarn add @polkadot/api
    ```

For more detailed information about installation, see the [Installation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/install/){target=\_blank} section in the official Polkadot.js API documentation.

## Get Started

### Creating an API Instance

To interact with a Polkadot SDK-based chain, you must establish a connection through an API instance. The API provides methods for querying chain state, sending transactions, and subscribing to updates.

To create an API connection:

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

// Create a WebSocket provider
const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io');

// Initialize the API
const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });

// Verify the connection by getting the chain's genesis hash
console.log('Genesis Hash:', api.genesisHash.toHex());
```

!!!warning
    All `await` operations must be wrapped in an async function or block since the API uses promises for asynchronous operations.

### Reading Chain Data

The API provides several ways to read data from the chain. You can access:

- **Constants** - values that are fixed in the runtime and don't change without a runtime upgrade

    ```js
    // Get the minimum balance required for a new account
const minBalance = api.consts.balances.existentialDeposit.toNumber();
    ```

- **State** - current chain state that updates with each block

    ```js
    // Example address
const address = '5DTestUPts3kjeXSTMyerHihn1uwMfLj8vU8sqF7qYrFabHE';

// Get current timestamp
const timestamp = await api.query.timestamp.now();

// Get account information
const { nonce, data: balance } = await api.query.system.account(address);

console.log(`
  Timestamp: ${timestamp}
  Free Balance: ${balance.free}
  Nonce: ${nonce}
`);
    ```

### Sending Transactions

Transactions (also called extrinsics) modify the chain state. Before sending a transaction, you need:

- A funded account with sufficient balance to pay transaction fees
- The account's keypair for signing

To make a transfer:

```js
// Assuming you have an `alice` keypair from the Keyring
const recipient = 'INSERT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS';
const amount = 'INSERT_VALUE'; // Amount in the smallest unit (e.g., Planck for DOT)

// Sign and send a transfer
const txHash = await api.tx.balances
  .transfer(recipient, amount)
  .signAndSend(alice);

console.log('Transaction Hash:', txHash);
```

The `alice` keypair in the example comes from a `Keyring` object. For more details about managing keypairs, see the [Keyring documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/keyring){target=\_blank}.

# Python Substrate Interface

## Introduction

The [Python Substrate Interface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface){target=\_blank} is a powerful library that enables interaction with Polkadot SDK-based chains. It provides essential functionality for:

- Querying on-chain storage
- Composing and submitting extrinsics
- SCALE encoding/decoding
- Interacting with Substrate runtime metadata
- Managing blockchain interactions through convenient utility methods

## Installation

Install the library using `pip`:

```py
pip install substrate-interface
```

For more installation details, see the [Installation](https://polkascan.github.io/py-substrate-interface/getting-started/installation/){target=\_blank} section in the official Python Substrate Interface documentation.

## Get Started

This guide will walk you through the basic operations with the Python Substrate Interface: connecting to a node, reading chain state, and submitting transactions.

### Establishing Connection

The first step is to establish a connection to a Polkadot SDK-based node. You can connect to either a local or remote node:

```py
from substrateinterface import SubstrateInterface

# Connect to a node using websocket
substrate = SubstrateInterface(
    # For local node: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944"
    # For Polkadot: "wss://rpc.polkadot.io"
    # For Kusama: "wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io"
    url="INSERT_WS_URL"
)

# Verify connection
print(f"Connected to chain: {substrate.chain}")
```

### Reading Chain State

You can query various on-chain storage items. To retrieve data, you need to specify three key pieces of information:

- **Pallet name** - module or pallet that contains the storage item you want to access
- **Storage item** - specific storage entry you want to query within the pallet
- **Required parameters** - any parameters needed to retrieve the desired data

Here's an example of how to check an account's balance and other details:

```py
# ...

# Query account balance and info
account_info = substrate.query(
    module="System",  # The pallet name
    storage_function="Account",  # The storage item
    params=["INSERT_ADDRESS"],  # Account address in SS58 format
)

# Access account details from the result
free_balance = account_info.value["data"]["free"]
reserved = account_info.value["data"]["reserved"]
nonce = account_info.value["nonce"]

print(
    f"""
    Account Details:
    - Free Balance: {free_balance}
    - Reserved: {reserved} 
    - Nonce: {nonce}
    """
)
```

### Submitting Transactions

To modify the chain state, you need to submit transactions (extrinsics). Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- A funded account with sufficient balance to pay transaction fees
- Access to the account's keypair

Here's how to create and submit a balance transfer:

```py
#...

# Compose the transfer call
call = substrate.compose_call(
    call_module="Balances",  # The pallet name
    call_function="transfer_keep_alive",  # The extrinsic function
    call_params={
        'dest': 'INSERT_ADDRESS',  # Recipient's address
        'value': 'INSERT_VALUE'  # Amount in smallest unit (e.g., Planck for DOT)
    }
)

# Create a signed extrinsic
extrinsic = substrate.create_signed_extrinsic(
    call=call, keypair=keypair  # Your keypair for signing
)

# Submit and wait for inclusion
receipt = substrate.submit_extrinsic(
    extrinsic, wait_for_inclusion=True  # Wait until the transaction is in a block
)

if receipt.is_success:
    print(
        f"""
        Transaction successful:
        - Extrinsic Hash: {receipt.extrinsic_hash}
        - Block Hash: {receipt.block_hash}
        """
    )
else:
    print(f"Transaction failed: {receipt.error_message}")
```

The `keypair` object is essential for signing transactions. See the [Keypair](https://polkascan.github.io/py-substrate-interface/usage/keypair-creation-and-signing/){target=\_blank} documentation for more details.

## Where to Go Next

Now that you understand the basics, you can:

# Sidecar API

## Introduction

The [Sidecar Rest API](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar){target=\_blank} is a service that provides a REST interface for interacting with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. With this API, developers can easily access a broad range of endpoints for nodes, accounts, transactions, parachains, and more.

Sidecar functions as a caching layer between your application and a Polkadot SDK-based node, offering standardized REST endpoints that simplify interactions without requiring complex, direct RPC calls. This approach is especially valuable for developers who prefer REST APIs or build applications in languages with limited WebSocket support.

Some of the key features of the Sidecar API include:

- **REST API interface** - provides a familiar REST API interface for interacting with Polkadot SDK-based chains
- **Standardized endpoints** - offers consistent endpoint formats across different chain implementations
- **Caching layer** - acts as a caching layer to improve performance and reduce direct node requests
- **Multiple chain support** - works with any Polkadot SDK-based chain, including Polkadot, Kusama, and custom chains

## Prerequisites

Sidecar API requires Node.js version 18.14 LTS or higher. Verify your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

If you need to install or update Node.js, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/){target=\_blank} to download and install the latest LTS version.

## Installation

To install Substrate API Sidecar, use one of the following commands:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install -g @substrate/api-sidecar
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install -g @substrate/api-sidecar
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn global add @substrate/api-sidecar
    ```

You can confirm the installation by running:

```bash
substrate-api-sidecar --version
```

For more information about the Sidecar API installation, see the [installation and usage](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar?tab=readme-ov-file#npm-package-installation-and-usage){target=\_blank} section of the Sidecar API README.

## Usage

To use the Sidecar API, you have two options:

- **Local node** - run a node locally, which Sidecar will connect to by default, requiring no additional configuration. To start, run:
    ```
    substrate-api-sidecar
    ```
- **Remote node** - connect Sidecar to a remote node by specifying the RPC endpoint for that chain. For example, to gain access to the Polkadot Asset Hub associated endpoints:
    ```
    SAS_SUBSTRATE_URL=wss://polkadot-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io substrate-api-sidecar
    ```

    For more configuration details, see the [Configuration](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration){target=\_blank} section of the Sidecar API documentation.

Once the Sidecar API is running, you’ll see output similar to this:

</div>

With Sidecar running, you can access the exposed endpoints via a browser, [`Postman`](https://www.postman.com/){target=\_blank}, [`curl`](https://curl.se/){target=\_blank}, or your preferred tool.

### Endpoints

Sidecar API provides a set of REST endpoints that allow you to query different aspects of the chain, including blocks, accounts, and transactions. Each endpoint offers specific insights into the chain’s state and activities.

For example, to retrieve the version of the node, use the `/node/version` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8080/node/version' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

Alternatively, you can access `http://127.0.0.1:8080/node/version` directly in a browser since it’s a `GET` request.

In response, you’ll see output similar to this (assuming you’re connected to Polkadot Asset Hub):

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>curl -X 'GET' 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/node/version' -H 'accept: application/json'</span>
    <br>
    <span data-ty>{</span>
    <span data-ty>    "clientVersion": "1.16.1-835e0767fe8",</span>
    <span data-ty>    "clientImplName": "statemint",</span>
    <span data-ty>    "chain": "Polkadot Asset Hub"</span>
    <span data-ty>}</span>
</div>

# Indexers

## The Challenge of Blockchain Data Access

Blockchain data is inherently sequential and distributed, with information stored chronologically across numerous blocks. While retrieving data from a single block through JSON-RPC API calls is straightforward, more complex queries that span multiple blocks present significant challenges:

- Data is scattered and unorganized across the blockchain
- Retrieving large datasets can take days or weeks to sync
- Complex operations (like aggregations, averages, or cross-chain queries) require additional processing
- Direct blockchain queries can impact dApp performance and responsiveness

## What is a Blockchain Indexer?

A blockchain indexer is a specialized infrastructure tool that processes, organizes, and stores blockchain data in an optimized format for efficient querying. Think of it as a search engine for blockchain data that:

- Continuously monitors the blockchain for new blocks and transactions
- Processes and categorizes this data according to predefined schemas
- Stores the processed data in an easily queryable database
- Provides efficient APIs (typically [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/){target=\_blank}) for data retrieval

## Indexer Implementations

# Oracles

## What is a Blockchain Oracle?

Oracles enable blockchains to access external data sources. Since blockchains operate as isolated networks, they cannot natively interact with external systems - this limitation is known as the "blockchain oracle problem." Oracles solves this by extracting data from external sources (like APIs, IoT devices, or other blockchains), validating it, and submitting it on-chain.

While simple oracle implementations may rely on a single trusted provider, more sophisticated solutions use decentralized networks where multiple providers stake assets and reach consensus on data validity. Typical applications include DeFi price feeds, weather data for insurance contracts, and cross-chain asset verification.

## Oracle Implementations

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   __Acurast__

    ---

    Acurast is a decentralized, serverless cloud platform that uses a distributed network of mobile devices for oracle services, addressing centralized trust and data ownership issues.

# Asset Transfer API

## Introduction

[Asset Transfer API](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api){target=\_blank}, a tool developed and maintained by [Parity](https://www.parity.io/){target=\_blank}, is a specialized library designed to streamline asset transfers for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. This API provides a simplified set of methods for users to:

- Execute asset transfers to other parachains or locally within the same chain
- Facilitate transactions involving system parachains like Asset Hub (Polkadot and Kusama)

Using this API, developers can manage asset transfers more efficiently, reducing the complexity of cross-chain transactions and enabling smoother operations within the ecosystem.

For additional support and information, please reach out through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api/issues){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank} (recommended version 21 or greater)
- Package manager - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank} should be installed with Node.js by default. Alternatively, you can use other package managers like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}

This documentation covers version `{{dependencies.asset_transfer_api.version}}` of Asset Transfer API. 

## Install Asset Transfer API

To use `asset-transfer-api`, you need a TypeScript project. If you don't have one, you can create a new one:

1. Create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-asset-transfer-project \
    && cd my-asset-transfer-project
    ```

2. Initialize a new TypeScript project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y \
    && npm install typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev \
    && npx tsc --init
    ```

Once you have a project set up, you can install the `asset-transfer-api` package. Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
npm install @substrate/asset-transfer-api@{{dependencies.asset_transfer_api.version}}
```

## Set Up Asset Transfer API

To initialize the Asset Transfer API, you need three key components:

- A Polkadot.js API instance
- The `specName` of the chain
- The XCM version to use

### Using Helper Function from Library

Leverage the `constructApiPromise` helper function provided by the library for the simplest setup process. It not only constructs a Polkadot.js `ApiPromise` but also automatically retrieves the chain's `specName` and fetches a safe XCM version. By using this function, developers can significantly reduce boilerplate code and potential configuration errors, making the initial setup both quicker and more robust.

```ts
import {
  AssetTransferApi,
  constructApiPromise,
} from '@substrate/asset-transfer-api';

async function main() {
  const { api, specName, safeXcmVersion } = await constructApiPromise(
    'INSERT_WEBSOCKET_URL',
  );

  const assetsApi = new AssetTransferApi(api, specName, safeXcmVersion);

  // Your code using assetsApi goes here
}

main();
```

!!!warning
    The code example is enclosed in an async main function to provide the necessary asynchronous context. However, you can use the code directly if you're already working within an async environment. The key is to ensure you're in an async context when working with these asynchronous operations, regardless of your specific setup.

## Asset Transfer API Reference

For detailed information on the Asset Transfer API, including available methods, data types, and functionalities, refer to the [Asset Transfer API Reference](/develop/toolkit/interoperability/asset-transfer-api/reference){target=\_blank} section. This resource provides in-depth explanations and technical specifications to help you integrate and utilize the API effectively.

## Examples

### Relay to System Parachain Transfer

This example demonstrates how to initiate a cross-chain token transfer from a relay chain to a system parachain. Specifically, 1 WND will be transferred from a Westend (relay chain) account to a Westmint (system parachain) account.

```ts
import {
  AssetTransferApi,
  constructApiPromise,
} from '@substrate/asset-transfer-api';

async function main() {
  const { api, specName, safeXcmVersion } = await constructApiPromise(
    'wss://westend-rpc.polkadot.io',
  );
  const assetApi = new AssetTransferApi(api, specName, safeXcmVersion);
  let callInfo;
  try {
    callInfo = await assetApi.createTransferTransaction(
      '1000',
      '5EWNeodpcQ6iYibJ3jmWVe85nsok1EDG8Kk3aFg8ZzpfY1qX',
      ['WND'],
      ['1000000000000'],
      {
        format: 'call',
        xcmVersion: safeXcmVersion,
      },
    );

    console.log(`Call data:\n${JSON.stringify(callInfo, null, 4)}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw Error(e as string);
  }

  const decoded = assetApi.decodeExtrinsic(callInfo.tx, 'call');
  console.log(`\nDecoded tx:\n${JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(decoded), null, 4)}`);
}

main()
  .catch((err) => console.error(err))
  .finally(() => process.exit());
```

After running the script, you'll see the following output in the terminal, which shows the call data for the cross-chain transfer and its decoded extrinsic details:

### Local Parachain Transfer

The following example demonstrates a local GLMR transfer within Moonbeam, using the `balances` pallet. It transfers 1 GLMR token from one account to another account, where both the sender and recipient accounts are located on the same parachain.

```ts
import {
  AssetTransferApi,
  constructApiPromise,
} from '@substrate/asset-transfer-api';

async function main() {
  const { api, specName, safeXcmVersion } = await constructApiPromise(
    'wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network',
  );
  const assetApi = new AssetTransferApi(api, specName, safeXcmVersion);

  let callInfo;
  try {
    callInfo = await assetApi.createTransferTransaction(
      '2004',
      '0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC',
      [],
      ['1000000000000000000'],
      {
        format: 'call',
        keepAlive: true,
      },
    );

    console.log(`Call data:\n${JSON.stringify(callInfo, null, 4)}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw Error(e as string);
  }

  const decoded = assetApi.decodeExtrinsic(callInfo.tx, 'call');
  console.log(`\nDecoded tx:\n${JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(decoded), null, 4)}`);
}

main()
  .catch((err) => console.error(err))
  .finally(() => process.exit());
```

Upon executing this script, the terminal will display the following output, illustrating the encoded extrinsic for the cross-chain message and its corresponding decoded format:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>ts-node localParachainTx.ts</span>
    <br>
	<span data-ty>Call data:</span>
	<span data-ty>{</span>
	<span data-ty>    "origin": "moonbeam",</span>
	<span data-ty>    "dest": "moonbeam",</span>
	<span data-ty>    "direction": "local",</span>
	<span data-ty>    "xcmVersion": null,</span>
	<span data-ty>    "method": "balances::transferKeepAlive",</span>
	<span data-ty>    "format": "call",</span>
	<span data-ty>    "tx": "0x0a03f977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec821a0600"</span>
	<span data-ty>}</span>
	<span data-ty></span>
	<span data-ty>Decoded tx:</span>
	<span data-ty>{</span>
	<span data-ty>    "args": {</span>
	<span data-ty>        "dest": "0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC",</span>
	<span data-ty>        "value": "1,000,000,000,000,000,000"</span>
	<span data-ty>    },</span>
	<span data-ty>    "method": "transferKeepAlive",</span>
	<span data-ty>    "section": "balances"</span>
	<span data-ty>}</span>
</div>

### Parachain to Parachain Transfer

This example demonstrates creating a cross-chain asset transfer between two parachains. It shows how to send vMOVR and vBNC from a Moonriver account to a Bifrost Kusama account using the safe XCM version. It connects to Moonriver, initializes the API, and uses the `createTransferTransaction` method to prepare a transaction.

```ts
import {
  AssetTransferApi,
  constructApiPromise,
} from '@substrate/asset-transfer-api';

async function main() {
  const { api, specName, safeXcmVersion } = await constructApiPromise(
    'wss://moonriver.public.blastapi.io',
  );
  const assetApi = new AssetTransferApi(api, specName, safeXcmVersion);
  let callInfo;
  try {
    callInfo = await assetApi.createTransferTransaction(
      '2001',
      '0xc4db7bcb733e117c0b34ac96354b10d47e84a006b9e7e66a229d174e8ff2a063',
      ['vMOVR', '72145018963825376852137222787619937732'],
      ['1000000', '10000000000'],
      {
        format: 'call',
        xcmVersion: safeXcmVersion,
      },
    );

    console.log(`Call data:\n${JSON.stringify(callInfo, null, 4)}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw Error(e as string);
  }

  const decoded = assetApi.decodeExtrinsic(callInfo.tx, 'call');
  console.log(`\nDecoded tx:\n${JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(decoded), null, 4)}`);
}

main()
  .catch((err) => console.error(err))
  .finally(() => process.exit());
```

After running this script, you'll see the following output in your terminal. This output presents the encoded extrinsic for the cross-chain message, along with its decoded format, providing a clear view of the transaction details.

<div id='termynal' data-termynal>
    <span data-ty='input'><span class='file-path'></span>ts-node paraToPara.ts</span>

    <br>

## Asset Transfer API Class

Holds open an API connection to a specified chain within the `ApiPromise` to help construct transactions for assets and estimate fees.

For a more in-depth explanation of the Asset Transfer API class structure, check the [source code](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api/blob/{{dependencies.asset_transfer_api.version}}/src/AssetTransferApi.ts#L121){target=\_blank}.

### Methods

#### Create Transfer Transaction

Generates an XCM transaction for transferring assets between chains. It simplifies the process by inferring what type of transaction is required given the inputs, ensuring that the assets are valid, and that the transaction details are correctly formatted.

After obtaining the transaction, you must handle the signing and submission process separately.

```ts
public async createTransferTransaction<T extends Format>(
		destChainId: string,
		destAddr: string,
		assetIds: string[],
		amounts: string[],
		opts: TransferArgsOpts<T> = {},
	): Promise<TxResult<T>> {
```

??? interface "Request parameters"

    `destChainId` ++"string"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>
    
    ID of the destination chain (`'0'` for relay chain, other values for parachains).

    ---

    `destAddr` ++"string"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    Address of the recipient account on the destination chain.

    ---

    `assetIds` ++"string[]"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    Array of asset IDs to be transferred.

    When asset IDs are provided, the API dynamically selects the appropriate pallet for the current chain to handle these specific assets. If the array is empty, the API defaults to using the `balances` pallet.

    ---

    `amounts` ++"string[]"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    Array of amounts corresponding to each asset in `assetIds`.

    ---

    `opts` ++"TransferArgsOpts<T>"++

    Options for customizing the claim assets transaction. These options allow you to specify the transaction format, fee payment details, weight limits, XCM versions, and more.

??? child "Show more"

    `format` ++"T extends Format"++ 
        
    Specifies the format for returning a transaction.

# XCM Tools

## Introduction

As described in the [Interoperability](/develop/interoperability){target=\_blank} section, XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) is a protocol used in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to enable communication and interaction between chains. It facilitates cross-chain communication, allowing assets, data, and messages to flow seamlessly across the ecosystem.

As XCM is central to enabling communication between blockchains, developers need robust tools to help interact with, build, and test XCM messages. Several XCM tools simplify working with the protocol by providing libraries, frameworks, and utilities that enhance the development process, ensuring that applications built within the Polkadot ecosystem can efficiently use cross-chain functionalities.

## Popular XCM Tools

# E2E Testing with Moonwall

## Introduction

Moonwall is an end-to-end testing framework designed explicitly for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. It addresses one of the most significant challenges in blockchain development: managing complex test environments and network configurations.

Moonwall consolidates this complexity by providing the following:

- A centralized configuration management system that explicitly defines all network parameters
- A standardized approach to environment setup across different Substrate-based chains
- Built-in utilities for common testing scenarios and network interactions

Developers can focus on writing meaningful tests rather than managing infrastructure complexities or searching through documentation for configuration options.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank} (version 20.10 or higher)
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}, or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/){target=\_blank}

## Install Moonwall

Moonwall can be installed globally for system-wide access or locally within specific projects. This section covers both installation methods.

!!! tip
    This documentation corresponds to Moonwall version `{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}`. To avoid compatibility issues with the documented features, ensure you're using the matching version.

### Global Installation

Global installation provides system-wide access to the Moonwall CLI, making it ideal for developers working across multiple blockchain projects. Install it by running one of the following commands:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install -g @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm -g install @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn global add @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

Now, you can run the `moonwall` command from your terminal.

### Local Installation

Local installation is recommended for better dependency management and version control within a specific project. First, initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir my-moonwall-project
cd my-moonwall-project
npm init -y
```

Then, install it as a local dependency:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @moonwall/cli@{{ dependencies.moonwall.version }}
    ```

## Initialize Moonwall

The `moonwall init` command launches an interactive wizard to create your configuration file:

```bash
moonwall init
```

During setup, you will see prompts for the following parameters:

- **`label`** - identifies your test configuration
- **`global timeout`** - maximum time (ms) for test execution
- **`environment name`** - name for your testing environment
- **`network foundation`** - type of blockchain environment to use
- **`tests directory`** - location of your test files

Select `Enter` to accept defaults or input custom values. You should see something like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>moonwall init</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide a label for the config file moonwall_config</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide a global timeout value 30000</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide a name for this environment default_env</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ What type of network foundation is this? dev</span>
  <span data-ty>✔ Provide the path for where tests for this environment are kept tests/</span>
  <span data-ty>? Would you like to generate this config? (no to restart from beginning) (Y/n)</span>
</div>

The wizard generates a `moonwall.config` file:

```json
{
    "label": "moonwall_config",
    "defaultTestTimeout": 30000,
    "environments": [
        {
            "name": "default_env",
            "testFileDir": ["tests/"],
            "foundation": {
                "type": "dev"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The default configuration requires specific details about your blockchain node and test requirements:

- The `foundation` object defines how your test blockchain node will be launched and managed. The dev foundation, which runs a local node binary, is used for local development
    
For more information about available options, check the [Foundations](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/foundations.html){target=\_blank} section.

- The `connections` array specifies how your tests will interact with the blockchain node. This typically includes provider configuration and endpoint details
    
A provider is a tool that allows you or your application to connect to a blockchain network and simplifies the low-level details of the process. A provider handles submitting transactions, reading state, and more. For more information on available providers, check the [Providers supported](https://moonsong-labs.github.io/moonwall/guide/intro/providers.html#providers-supported){target=\_blank} page in the Moonwall documentation.

Here's a complete configuration example for testing a local node using Polkadot.js as a provider:

```json
{
    "label": "moonwall_config",
    "defaultTestTimeout": 30000,
    "environments": [
        {
            "name": "default_env",
            "testFileDir": ["tests/"],
            "foundation": {
                "launchSpec": [
                    {
                        "binPath": "./node-template",
                        "newRpcBehaviour": true,
                        "ports": { "rpcPort": 9944 }
                    }
                ],
                "type": "dev"
            },
            "connections": [
                {
                    "name": "myconnection",
                    "type": "polkadotJs",
                    "endpoints": ["ws://127.0.0.1:9944"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Writing Tests

Moonwall uses the [`describeSuite`](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/moonwall/blob/7568048c52e9f7844f38fb4796ae9e1b9205fdaa/packages/cli/src/lib/runnerContext.ts#L65){target=\_blank} function to define test suites, like using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/){target=\_blank}. Each test suite requires the following:

- **`id`** - unique identifier for the suite
- **`title`** - descriptive name for the suite
- **`foundationMethods`** - specifies the testing environment (e.g., `dev` for local node testing)
- **`testCases`** - a callback function that houses the individual test cases of this suite

The following example shows how to test a balance transfer between two accounts:

```ts
import '@polkadot/api-augment';
import { describeSuite, expect } from '@moonwall/cli';
import { Keyring } from '@polkadot/api';

describeSuite({
  id: 'D1',
  title: 'Demo suite',
  foundationMethods: 'dev',
  testCases: ({ it, context, log }) => {
    it({
      id: 'T1',
      title: 'Test Case',
      test: async () => {
        // Set up polkadot.js API and testing accounts
        let api = context.polkadotJs();
        let alice = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' }).addFromUri('//Alice');
        let charlie = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' }).addFromUri('//Charlie');

        // Query Charlie's account balance before transfer
        const balanceBefore = (await api.query.system.account(charlie.address))
          .data.free;

        // Before transfer, Charlie's account balance should be 0
        expect(balanceBefore.toString()).toEqual('0');
        log('Balance before: ' + balanceBefore.toString());

        // Transfer from Alice to Charlie
        const amount = 1000000000000000;
        await api.tx.balances
          .transferAllowDeath(charlie.address, amount)
          .signAndSend(alice);

        // Wait for the transaction to be included in a block.
        // This is necessary because the balance is not updated immediately.
        // Block time is 6 seconds.
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 6000));

        // Query Charlie's account balance after transfer
        const balanceAfter = (await api.query.system.account(charlie.address))
          .data.free;

        // After transfer, Charlie's account balance should be 1000000000000000
        expect(balanceAfter.toString()).toEqual(amount.toString());
        log('Balance after: ' + balanceAfter.toString());
      },
    });
  },
});
```

This test demonstrates several key concepts:

- Initializing the Polkadot.js API through Moonwall's context and setting up test accounts
- Querying on-chain state
- Executing transactions
- Waiting for block inclusion
- Verifying results using assertions

## Running the Tests

Execute your tests using the `test` Moonwall CLI command. For the default environment setup run:

```bash
moonwall test default_env -c moonwall.config
```

The test runner will output detailed results showing:

- Test suite execution status
- Individual test case results
- Execution time
- Detailed logs and error messages (if any)

# Get Started

## Introduction

[Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/){target=\_blank}, developed by the [Acala Foundation](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork){target=\_blank}, is a versatile tool tailored for developers working on Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. With Chopsticks, you can fork live chains locally, replay blocks to analyze extrinsics, and simulate complex scenarios like XCM interactions all without deploying to a live network.

This guide walks you through installing Chopsticks and provides information on configuring a local blockchain fork. By streamlining testing and experimentation, Chopsticks empowers developers to innovate and accelerate their blockchain projects within the Polkadot ecosystem.

For additional support and information, please reach out through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/issues){target=_blank}.

!!! warning
    Chopsticks uses [Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=_blank} light client, which only supports the native Polkadot SDK API. Consequently, a Chopsticks-based fork doesn't support Ethereum JSON-RPC calls, meaning you cannot use it to fork your chain and connect Metamask.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){target=\_blank}
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){target=\_blank}, which should be installed with Node.js by default, or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/){target=\_blank}

## Install Chopsticks

You can install Chopsticks globally or locally in your project. Choose the option that best fits your development workflow. This documentation explains the features of Chopsticks version `{{ dependencies.chopsticks.version }}`. Make sure you're using the correct version to match these instructions.

### Global Installation

To install Chopsticks globally, allowing you to use it across multiple projects, run:

```bash
npm i -g @acala-network/chopsticks@{{ dependencies.chopsticks.version }}
```

Now, you should be able to run the `chopsticks` command from your terminal.

### Local Installation

To use Chopsticks in a specific project, first create a new directory and initialize a Node.js project:

```bash
mkdir my-chopsticks-project
cd my-chopsticks-project
npm init -y
```

Then, install Chopsticks as a local dependency:

```bash
npm i @acala-network/chopsticks@{{ dependencies.chopsticks.version }}
```

Finally, you can run Chopsticks using the `npx` command. To see all available options and commands, run it with the `--help` flag:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks --help
```

## Configure Chopsticks

To run Chopsticks, you need to configure some parameters. This can be set either through using a configuration file or the command line interface (CLI). The parameters that can be configured are as follows:

- `genesis` - the link to a parachain's raw genesis file to build the fork from, instead of an endpoint
- `timestamp` - timestamp of the block to fork from
- `endpoint` - the endpoint of the parachain to fork
- `block` - use to specify at which block hash or number to replay the fork
- `wasm-override` - path of the Wasm to use as the parachain runtime, instead of an endpoint's runtime
- `db` - path to the name of the file that stores or will store the parachain's database
- `config` - path or URL of the config file
- `port` - the port to expose an endpoint on
- `build-block-mode` - how blocks should be built in the fork: batch, manual, instant
- `import-storage` - a pre-defined JSON/YAML storage path to override in the parachain's storage
- `allow-unresolved-imports` - whether to allow Wasm unresolved imports when using a Wasm to build the parachain
- `html` - include to generate storage diff preview between blocks
- `mock-signature-host` - mock signature host so that any signature starts with `0xdeadbeef` and filled by `0xcd` is considered valid

### Configuration File

The Chopsticks source repository includes a collection of [YAML](https://yaml.org/){target=\_blank} files that can be used to set up various Polkadot SDK chains locally. You can download these configuration files from the [repository's `configs` folder](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/tree/master/configs){target=\_blank}.

An example of a configuration file for Polkadot is as follows:

```yaml
endpoint:
  - wss://rpc.ibp.network/polkadot
  - wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com
mock-signature-host: true
block: ${env.POLKADOT_BLOCK_NUMBER}
db: ./db.sqlite
runtime-log-level: 5

import-storage:
  System:
    Account:
      - - - 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
        - providers: 1
          data:
            free: '10000000000000000000'
  ParasDisputes:
    $removePrefix: ['disputes'] # those can makes block building super slow
```

The configuration file allows you to modify the storage of the forked network by rewriting the pallet, state component and value that you want to change. For example, Polkadot's file rewrites Alice's `system.Account` storage so that the free balance is set to `10000000000000000000`.

### CLI Flags

Alternatively, all settings (except for genesis and timestamp) can be configured via command-line flags, providing a comprehensive method to set up the environment.

# Get Started

## Introduction

Zombienet is a robust testing framework designed for Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks. It enables developers to efficiently deploy and test ephemeral blockchain environments on platforms like Kubernetes, Podman, and native setups. With its simple and versatile CLI, Zombienet provides an all-in-one solution for spawning networks, running tests, and validating performance.

This guide will outline the different installation methods for Zombienet, provide step-by-step instructions for setting up on various platforms, and highlight essential provider-specific features and requirements.

By following this guide, Zombienet will be up and running quickly, ready to streamline your blockchain testing and development workflows.

## Install Zombienet

Zombienet releases are available on the [Zombienet repository](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=\_blank}.

Multiple options are available for installing Zombienet, depending on the user's preferences and the environment where it will be used. The following section will guide you through the installation process for each option.

=== "Use the executable"
    Install Zombienet using executables by visiting the [latest release](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases){target=\_blank} page and selecting the appropriate asset for your operating system. You can download the executable and move it to a directory in your PATH. 

    Each release includes executables for Linux and macOS. Executables are generated using [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg){target=\_blank}, which allows the Zombienet CLI to operate without requiring Node.js to be installed. 

    Then, ensure the downloaded file is executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }}
    ```

    Finally, you can run the following command to check if the installation was successful. If so, it will display the version of the installed Zombienet:

    ```bash
    ./zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }} version
    ```

    If you want to add the `zombienet` executable to your PATH, you can move it to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

    ```bash
    mv zombienet-{{ dependencies.zombienet.architecture }} /usr/local/bin/zombienet
    ```

    Now you can refer to the `zombienet` executable directly.

    ```bash
    zombienet version
    ```

=== "Use Nix"
    For Nix users, the Zombienet repository provides a [`flake.nix`](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/blob/main/flake.nix){target=\_blank} file to install Zombienet making it easy to incorporate Zombienet into Nix-based projects.
    
    To install Zombienet utilizing Nix, users can run the following command, triggering the fetching of the flake and subsequently installing the Zombienet package:

    ```bash
    nix run github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION -- \
    spawn INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME.toml
    ```

    Replace the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION` with the desired version of Zombienet and the `INSERT_ZOMBIENET_CONFIG_FILE_NAME` with the name of the configuration file you want to use.

    To run the command above, you need to have [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes){target=\_blank} enabled.

    Alternatively, you can also include the Zombienet binary in the PATH for the current shell using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    nix shell github:paritytech/zombienet/INSERT_ZOMBIENET_VERSION
    ```

=== "Use Docker"
    Zombienet can also be run using Docker. The Zombienet repository provides a Docker image that can be used to run the Zombienet CLI. To run Zombienet using Docker, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files \
    paritytech/zombienet
    ```

    The command above will run the Zombienet CLI inside a Docker container and mount the current directory to the `/home/nonroot/zombie-net/host-current-files` directory. This allows Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

    Inside the Docker container, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. First, you need to set up Zombienet to download the necessary binaries:

    ```bash
    npm run zombie -- setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
    ```

    After that, you need to add those binaries to the PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/home/nonroot/zombie-net:$PATH
    ```

    Finally, you can run the Zombienet CLI commands. For example, to spawn a network using a specific configuration file, you can run the following command:

    ```bash
    pm run zombie -- -p native spawn host-current-files/minimal.toml
    ```

    The command above mounts the current directory to the `/workspace` directory inside the Docker container, allowing Zombienet to access the configuration file and other files in the current directory. If you want to mount a different directory, replace `$(pwd)` with the desired directory path.

## Providers

Zombienet supports different backend providers for running the nodes. At this moment, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){target=\_blank}, [Podman](https://podman.io/){target=\_blank}, and local providers are supported, which can be declared as `kubernetes`, `podman`, or `native`, respectively.

To use a particular provider, you can specify it in the network file or use the `--provider` flag in the CLI:

```bash
zombienet spawn network.toml --provider INSERT_PROVIDER
```

Alternatively, you can set the provider in the network file:

```toml
[settings]
provider = "INSERT_PROVIDER"
...
```

It's important to note that each provider has specific requirements and associated features. The following sections cover each provider's requirements and added features.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Zombienet is designed to be compatible with a variety of Kubernetes clusters, including: 

- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine){target=\_blank}
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/){target=\_blank}
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/){target=\_blank}

#### Requirements
    
To effectively interact with your cluster, you'll need to ensure that [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/){target=\_blank} is installed on your system. This Kubernetes command-line tool allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. If you don't have `kubectl` installed, you can follow the instructions provided in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl){target=\_blank}.

To create resources such as namespaces, pods, and CronJobs within the target cluster, you must grant your user or service account the appropriate permissions. These permissions are essential for managing and deploying applications effectively within Kubernetes.

#### Features
    
If available, Zombienet uses the Prometheus operator to oversee monitoring and visibility. This configuration ensures that only essential networking-related pods are deployed. Using the Prometheus operator, Zombienet improves its ability to monitor and manage network activities within the Kubernetes cluster efficiently.  

### Podman

Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and container images on Linux-based systems. Zombienet supports Podman rootless as a provider on Linux machines. Although Podman has support for macOS through an internal virtual machine (VM), the Zombienet provider code requires Podman to run natively on Linux.

#### Requirements
     
To use Podman as a provider, you need to have Podman installed on your system. You can install Podman by following the instructions provided on the [Podman website](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank}.

#### Features
    
Using Podman, Zombienet deploys additional pods to enhance the monitoring and visibility of the active network. Specifically, pods for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank}, [Tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/operations/monitor/){target=\_blank}, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/){target=\_blank} are included in the deployment. Grafana is configured with Prometheus and Tempo as data sources.

Upon launching Zombienet, access to these monitoring services is facilitated through specific URLs provided in the output:

- Prometheus - `http://127.0.0.1:34123`
- Tempo - `http://127.0.0.1:34125`
- Grafana - `http://127.0.0.1:41461`

It's important to note that Grafana is deployed with default administrator access. 
    
When network operations cease, either from halting a running spawn with the `Ctrl+C` command or test completion, Zombienet automatically removes all associated pods.

### Local Provider

The Zombienet local provider, also called native, enables you to run nodes as local processes in your environment.

#### Requirements
     
You must have the necessary binaries for your network (such as `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain`). These binaries should be available in your PATH, allowing Zombienet to spawn the nodes as local processes.

To install the necessary binaries, you can use the Zombienet CLI command:

```bash
zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
```

This command will download and prepare the necessary binaries for Zombienet's use.

!!! warning
    The `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain` binaries releases aren't compatible with macOS. As a result, macOS users will need to clone the [Polkadot repository](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank}, build the Polkadot binary, and manually add it to their PATH for `polkadot` and `polkadot-parachain` to work.

If you need to use a custom binary, ensure the binary is available in your PATH. You can also specify the binary path in the network configuration file. The following example uses the custom [OpenZeppelin template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates){target=\_blank}:

First, clone the OpenZeppelin template repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates \
&& cd polkadot-runtime-templates/generic-template
```

Next, run the command to build the custom binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Finally, add the custom binary to your PATH as follows:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:INSERT_PATH_TO_RUNTIME_TEMPLATES/parachain-template-node/target/release
```

Alternatively, you can specify the binary path in the network configuration file. The local provider exclusively utilizes the command configuration for nodes, which supports both relative and absolute paths. You can employ the `default_command` configuration to specify the binary for spawning all nodes in the relay chain.

```toml
[relaychain]
chain = "rococo-local"
default_command = "./bin-v1.6.0/polkadot"

[parachain]
id = 1000

    [parachain.collators]
    name = "collator01"
    command = "./target/release/parachain-template-node"
```

#### Features

The local provider does not offer any additional features.

## Configure Zombienet

Effective network configuration is crucial for deploying and managing blockchain systems. Zombienet simplifies this process by offering versatile configuration options in both JSON and TOML formats. Whether setting up a simple test network or a complex multi-node system, Zombienet's tools provide the flexibility to customize every aspect of your network's setup.

The following sections will explore the structure and usage of Zombienet configuration files, explain key settings for network customization, and walk through CLI commands and flags to optimize your development workflow.

### Configuration Files

The network configuration file can be either JSON or TOML format. The Zombienet repository also provides a collection of [example configuration files](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/tree/main/examples){target=\_blank} that can be used as a reference.

Each section may include provider-specific keys that aren't recognized by other providers. For example, if you use the local provider, any references to images for nodes will be disregarded.

### CLI Usage

Zombienet provides a CLI that allows interaction with the tool. The CLI can receive commands and flags to perform different kinds of operations. These operations use the following syntax:

```bash
zombienet <arguments> <commands>
```

The following sections will guide you through the primary usage of the Zombienet CLI and the available commands and flags.

#### CLI Commands

- **`spawn <networkConfig>`** - spawn the network defined in the [configuration file](#configuration-files)

    !!! warning
        The Polkadot binary is currently not compatible with macOS. For the `spawn` command to work on macOS, users will need to clone the [Polkadot repository](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank}, build the Polkadot binary, and manually add it to their PATH.

- **`test <testFile>`** - run tests on the spawned network using the assertions and tests defined in the [test file](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/write-tests/#the-test-file){target=\_blank}


- **`setup <binaries>`** - set up the Zombienet development environment to download and use the `polkadot` or `polkadot-parachain` executable

- **`convert <filePath>`** - transforms a [polkadot-launch](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch){target=\_blank} configuration file with a `.js` or `.json` extension into a Zombienet configuration file

- **`version`** - prints Zombienet version

- **`help`** - prints help information

#### CLI Flags

You can use the following flags to customize the behavior of the CLI:

- **`-p`, `--provider`** - override the [provider](#providers) to use

- **`-d`, `--dir`** - specify a directory path for placing the network files instead of using the default temporary path

- **`-f`, `--force`** - force override all prompt commands

- **`-l`, `--logType`** - type of logging on the console. Defaults to `table`

- **`-m`, `--monitor`** - start as monitor and don't auto clean up network

- **`-c`, `--spawn-concurrency`** - number of concurrent spawning processes to launch. Defaults to `1`

- **`-h`, `--help`** - display help for command

# Write Tests

## Introduction

Testing is a critical step in blockchain development, ensuring reliability, performance, and security. Zombienet simplifies this process with its intuitive Domain Specific Language (DSL), enabling developers to write natural-language test scripts tailored to their network needs.

This guide provides an in-depth look at how to create and execute test scenarios using Zombienet's flexible testing framework. You’ll learn how to define tests for metrics, logs, events, and more, allowing for comprehensive evaluation of your blockchain network’s behavior and performance.

## Testing DSL

Zombienet provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing tests. The DSL is designed to be human-readable and allows you to write tests using natural language expressions. You can define assertions and tests against the spawned network using this DSL. This way, users can evaluate different metrics, such as:

- **On-chain storage** - the storage of each of the chains running via Zombienet
- **Metrics** - the metrics provided by the nodes
- **Histograms** - visual representations of metrics data
- **Logs** - detailed records of system activities and events
- **System events** - notifications of significant occurrences within the network
- **Tracing** - detailed analysis of execution paths and operations
- **Custom API calls (through Polkadot.js)** - personalized interfaces for interacting with the network
- **Commands** - instructions or directives executed by the network

These abstractions are expressed by sentences defined in a natural language style. Therefore, each test line will be mapped to a test to run. Also, the test file (`*.zndsl`) includes pre-defined header fields used to define information about the suite, such as network configuration and credentials location.

For more details about the Zombienet DSL, see the [Testing DSL](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet/cli/test-dsl-definition-spec.html){target=\_blank} specification.

## The Test File

The test file is a text file with the extension `.zndsl`. It is divided into two parts: the header and the body. The header contains the network configuration and the credentials to use, while the body contains the tests to run.

The header is defined by the following fields:

- **`description`** ++"string"++ - long description of the test suite (optional)
- **`network`** ++"string"++ - path to the network definition file, supported in both `.json` and `.toml` formats
- **`creds`** ++"string"++ - credentials filename or path to use (available only with Kubernetes provider). Looks in the current directory or `$HOME/.kube/` if a filename is passed

The body contains the tests to run. Each test is defined by a sentence in the DSL, which is mapped to a test to run. Each test line defines an assertion or a command to be executed against the spawned network.

### Name

The test name in Zombienet is derived from the filename by removing any leading numeric characters before the first hyphen. For example, a file named `0001-zombienet-test.zndsl` will result in a test name of `zombienet-test`, which will be displayed in the test report output of the runner.

### Assertions

Assertions are defined by sentences in the DSL that evaluate different metrics, such as on-chain storage, metrics, histograms, logs, system events, tracing, and custom API calls. Each assertion is defined by a sentence in the DSL, which is mapped to a test to run.

- **`Well known functions`** - already mapped test function

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name well-known_defined_test [within x seconds]`

    === "Examples"

        ```bash

        alice: is up
        alice: parachain 100 is registered within 225 seconds
        alice: parachain 100 block height is at least 10 within 250 seconds
        
        ```

- **`Histogram`** - get metrics from Prometheus, calculate the histogram, and assert on the target value

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name reports histogram metric_name has comparator target_value samples in buckets ["bucket","bucket",...] [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash

        alice: reports histogram polkadot_pvf_execution_time has at least 2 samples in buckets ["0.1", "0.25", "0.5", "+Inf"] within 100 seconds
        
        ```

- **`Metric`** - get metric from Prometheus and assert on the target value

        ```bash

        alice: reports node_roles is 4
        alice: reports sub_libp2p_is_major_syncing is 0
        
        ```

- **`Log line`** - get logs from nodes and assert on the matching pattern

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name log line (contains|matches) (regex|glob) "pattern" [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash

        alice: log line matches glob "rted #1" within 10 seconds
        
        ```

- **`Count of log lines`** - get logs from nodes and assert on the number of lines matching pattern

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name count of log lines (containing|matching) (regex|glob) "pattern" [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        alice: count of log lines matching glob "rted #1" within 10 seconds
        ```

- **`System events`** - find a system event from subscription by matching a pattern

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name system event (contains|matches)(regex| glob) "pattern" [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        alice: system event matches ""paraId":[0-9]+" within 10 seconds
        ```

- **`Tracing`** - match an array of span names from the supplied `traceID`

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name trace with traceID contains ["name", "name2",...]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        alice: trace with traceID 94c1501a78a0d83c498cc92deec264d9 contains ["answer-chunk-request", "answer-chunk-request"]
        ```

- **`Custom JS scripts`** - run a custom JavaScript script and assert on the return value

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name js-script script_relative_path [return is comparator target_value] [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        alice: js-script ./0008-custom.js return is greater than 1 within 200 seconds
        ```

- **`Custom TS scripts`** - run a custom TypeScript script and assert on the return value

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name ts-script script_relative_path [return is comparator target_value] [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        alice: ts-script ./0008-custom-ts.ts return is greater than 1 within 200 seconds
        ```

- **`Backchannel`** - wait for a value and register to use

    === "Syntax"

        `node-name wait for var name and use as X [within x seconds]`

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        alice: wait for name and use as X within 30 seconds
        ```

### Commands

Commands allow interaction with the nodes and can run pre-defined commands or an arbitrary command in the node. Commonly used commands are as follows:

- **`restart`** - stop the process and start again after the `X` amount of seconds or immediately

- **`pause`** - pause (SIGSTOP) the process

- **`resume`** - resume (SIGCONT) the process

- **`sleep`** - sleep the test-runner for `x` amount of seconds

## Running a Test

To run a test against the spawned network, you can use the [Zombienet DSL](#testing-dsl) to define the test scenario. Follow these steps to create an example test:

1. Create a file named `spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl` 
```bash
touch spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl
```

2. Add the following code to the file you just created.
```toml title="spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl"
Description = "Test the basic functionality of the network (minimal example)"
Network = "./spawn-a-basic-network.toml"
Creds = "config"

# Alice's tasks
[[tasks]]
name = "alice"
is_up = true
parachain_100_registered = { condition = "within", timeout = 225 }
parachain_100_block_height = { condition = "at least 10", timeout = 250 }

# Bob's tasks
[[tasks]]
name = "bob"
is_up = true
parachain_100_registered = { condition = "within", timeout = 225 }
parachain_100_block_height = { condition = "at least 10", timeout = 250 }

# Metrics
[[metrics]]
name = "alice"
node_roles = 4
sub_libp2p_is_major_syncing = 0

[[metrics]]
name = "bob"
node_roles = 4

[[metrics]]
name = "collator01"
node_roles = 4
```

This test scenario checks to verify the following:

- Nodes are running
- The parachain with ID 100 is registered within a certain timeframe (255 seconds in this example)
- Parachain block height is at least a certain number within a timeframe (in this case, 10 within 255 seconds)
- Nodes are reporting metrics 

You can define any test scenario you need following the Zombienet DSL syntax.

To run the test, execute the following command:

```bash
zombienet -p native test spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl
```

This command will execute the test scenario defined in the `spawn-a-basic-network-test.zndsl` file on the network. If successful, the terminal will display the test output, indicating whether the test passed or failed.

## Example Test Files

The following example test files define two tests, a small network test and a big network test. Each test defines a network configuration file and credentials to use.

The tests define assertions to evaluate the network’s metrics and logs. The assertions are defined by sentences in the DSL, which are mapped to tests to run.

```toml title="small-network-test.zndsl"
Description = "Small Network test"
Network = "./0000-test-config-small-network.toml"
Creds = "config"

# Metrics
[[metrics]]
node_roles = 4
sub_libp2p_is_major_syncing = 0

# Logs
[[logs]]
bob_log_line_glob = "*rted #1*"
bob_log_line_regex = "Imported #[0-9]+"
```

And the second test file:

```toml title="big-network-test.zndsl"
Description = "Big Network test"
Network = "./0001-test-config-big-network.toml"
Creds = "config"

# Metrics
[[metrics]]
node_roles = 4
sub_libp2p_is_major_syncing = 0

# Logs
[[logs]]
bob_log_line_glob = "*rted #1*"
bob_log_line_regex = "Imported #[0-9]+"

# Custom JS script
[[custom_scripts]]
alice_js_script = { path = "./0008-custom.js", condition = "return is greater than 1", timeout = 200 }

# Custom TS script
[[custom_scripts]]
alice_ts_script = { path = "./0008-custom-ts.ts", condition = "return is greater than 1", timeout = 200 }

# Backchannel
[[backchannel]]
alice_wait_for_name = { use_as = "X", timeout = 30 }

# Well-known functions
[[functions]]
alice_is_up = true
alice_parachain_100_registered = { condition = "within", timeout = 225 }
alice_parachain_100_block_height = { condition = "at least 10", timeout = 250 }

# Histogram
[[histogram]]
alice_polkadot_pvf_execution_time = { min_samples = 2, buckets = [
  "0.1",
  "0.25",
  "0.5",
  "+Inf",
], timeout = 100 }

# System events
[[system_events]]
alice_system_event_matches = { pattern = "\"paraId\":[0-9]+", timeout = 10 }

# Tracing
[[tracing]]
alice_trace = { traceID = "94c1501a78a0d83c498cc92deec264d9", contains = [
  "answer-chunk-request",
  "answer-chunk-request",
] }

- Ready to get started? Jump to [In This Section](#in-this-section) to get started

## Choosing the Right Role

Selecting your role within the Polkadot ecosystem depends on your goals, resources, and expertise. Below are detailed considerations for each role:

- **Running a node**:
    - **Purpose** - a node provides access to network data and supports API queries. It is commonly used for:

# Running a Node

Running a node on the Polkadot network enables you to access blockchain data, interact with the network, and support decentralized applications (dApps). This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and connecting to a Polkadot node, including essential configuration steps for ensuring connectivity and security.

## Full Nodes vs Bootnodes

Full nodes and bootnodes serve different roles within the network, each contributing in unique ways to connectivity and data access:

- **Full node** - stores blockchain data, validates transactions, and can serve as a source for querying data
- **Bootnode** - assists new nodes in discovering peers and connecting to the network, but doesn’t store blockchain data

The following sections describe the different types of full nodes—pruned, archive, and light nodes—and the unique features of each for various use cases.

## Types of Full Nodes

The three main types of nodes are as follows:

- **Pruned node** - prunes historical states of all finalized block states older than a specified number except for the genesis block's state
- **Archive node** - preserves all the past blocks and their states, making it convenient to query the past state of the chain at any given time. Archive nodes use a lot of disk space, which means they should be limited to use cases that require easy access to past on-chain data, such as block explorers
- **Light node** - has only the runtime and the current state but doesn't store past blocks, making them useful for resource-restricted devices

Each node type can be configured to provide remote access to blockchain data via RPC endpoints, allowing external clients, like dApps or developers, to submit transactions, query data, and interact with the blockchain remotely.

    On [Stakeworld](https://stakeworld.io/docs/dbsize){target=\_blank}, you can find a list of the database sizes of Polkadot and Kusama nodes.

### State vs. Block Pruning

A pruned node retains only a subset of finalized blocks, discarding older data. The two main types of pruning are:

- **State pruning** - removes the states of old blocks while retaining block headers
- **Block pruning** - removes both the full content of old blocks and their associated states, but keeps the block headers

Despite these deletions, pruned nodes are still capable of performing many essential functions, such as displaying account balances, making transfers, setting up session keys, and participating in staking.

title: Set Up a Bootnode
description: Learn how to configure and run a bootnode for Polkadot, including P2P, WS, and secure WSS connections with network key management and proxies.
---

# Set Up a Bootnode

## Introduction

Bootnodes are essential for helping blockchain nodes discover peers and join the network. When a node starts, it needs to find other nodes, and bootnodes provide an initial point of contact. Once connected, a node can expand its peer connections and play its role in the network, like participating as a validator.

This guide will walk you through setting up a Polkadot bootnode, configuring P2P, WebSocket (WS), secure WSS connections, and managing network keys. You'll also learn how to test your bootnode to ensure it is running correctly and accessible to other nodes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Verify a working Polkadot (`polkadot`) binary is available on your machine
- Ensure you have nginx installed. Please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html){target=\_blank} for help with installation if needed
- A VPS or other dedicated server setup

## Accessing the Bootnode

Bootnodes must be accessible through three key channels to connect with other nodes in the network:

- **P2P** - a direct peer-to-peer connection, set by:

    ```bash

    --listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/INSERT_PORT

    ```
    
    This is not enabled by default on non-validator nodes like archive RPC nodes.

- **P2P/WS** - a WebSocket (WS) connection, also configured via `--listen-addr`
- **P2P/WSS** - a secure WebSocket (WSS) connection using SSL, often required for light clients. An SSL proxy is needed, as the node itself cannot handle certificates

## Node Key

A node key is the ED25519 key used by `libp2p` to assign your node an identity or peer ID. Generating a known node key for a bootnode is crucial, as it gives you a consistent key that can be placed in chain specifications as a known, reliable bootnode.

Starting a node creates its node key in the `chains/INSERT_CHAIN/network/secret_ed25519` file.

You can create a node key using:

 ``` bash
 polkadot key generate-node-key
 ``` 
 
This key can be used in the startup command line.

It is imperative that you backup the node key. If it is included in the `polkadot` binary, it is hardcoded into the binary, which must be recompiled to change the key.

## Running the Bootnode

A bootnode can be run as follows:

 ``` bash
 polkadot --chain polkadot \
 --name dot-bootnode \
 --listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30310 \
 --listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30311/ws
 ```

This assigns the p2p to port 30310 and p2p/ws to port 30311. For the p2p/wss port, a proxy must be set up with a DNS name and a corresponding certificate. The following example is for the popular nginx server and enables p2p/wss on port 30312 by adding a proxy to the p2p/ws port 30311:

``` conf title="/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dot-bootnode"
server {
       listen       30312 ssl http2 default_server;
       server_name  dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io;
       root         /var/www/html;

       ssl_certificate "INSERT_YOUR_CERT";
       ssl_certificate_key "INSERT_YOUR_KEY";

       location / {
         proxy_buffers 16 4k;
         proxy_buffer_size 2k;
         proxy_pass http://localhost:30311;
         proxy_http_version 1.1;
         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
         proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
         proxy_set_header Host $host;
   }

}
```

## Testing Bootnode Connection

If the preceding node is running with DNS name `dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io`, which contains a proxy with a valid certificate and node-id `12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg` then the following commands should output `syncing 1 peers`.

!!!tip
    You can add `-lsub-libp2p=trace` on the end to get libp2p trace logging for debugging purposes.

### P2P

```bash
polkadot --chain polkadot \
--base-path /tmp/node \
--name "Bootnode testnode" \
--reserved-only \
--reserved-nodes "/dns/dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io/tcp/30310/p2p/12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg" \
--no-hardware-benchmarks
```

### P2P/WS

```bash
polkadot --chain polkadot \
--base-path /tmp/node \
--name "Bootnode testnode" \
--reserved-only \
--reserved-nodes "/dns/dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io/tcp/30311/ws/p2p/12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg" \
--no-hardware-benchmarks
```

### P2P/WSS

```bash
polkadot --chain polkadot \
--base-path /tmp/node \
--name "Bootnode testnode" \
--reserved-only \
--reserved-nodes "/dns/dot-bootnode.stakeworld.io/tcp/30312/wss/p2p/12D3KooWAb5MyC1UJiEQJk4Hg4B2Vi3AJdqSUhTGYUqSnEqCFMFg" \

# Set Up a Node

## Introduction

Running a node on Polkadot provides direct interaction with the network, enhanced privacy, and full control over RPC requests, transactions, and data queries. As the backbone of the network, nodes ensure decentralized data propagation, transaction validation, and seamless communication across the ecosystem.

Polkadot supports multiple node types, including pruned, archive, and light nodes, each suited to specific use cases. During setup, you can use configuration flags to choose the node type you wish to run.

This guide walks you through configuring, securing, and maintaining a node on Polkadot or any Polkadot SDK-based chain. It covers instructions for the different node types and how to safely expose your node's RPC server for external access. Whether you're building a local development environment, powering dApps, or supporting network decentralization, this guide provides all the essentials.

## Set Up a Node

Now that you're familiar with the different types of nodes, this section will walk you through configuring, securing, and maintaining a node on Polkadot or any Polkadot SDK-based chain.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Ensure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install){target=\_blank} is installed on your operating system
- [Install the necessary dependencies for the Polkadot SDK](/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}

!!! warning
    This setup is not recommended for validators. If you plan to run a validator, refer to the [Running a Validator](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/){target=\_blank} guide for proper instructions.

### Install and Build the Polkadot Binary

This section will walk you through installing and building the Polkadot binary for different operating systems and methods.

??? interface "macOS"

    To get started, update and configure the Rust toolchain by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    source ~/.cargo/env

    rustup default stable
    rustup update

    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    rustup component add rust-src --toolchain stable-aarch64-apple-darwin
    ```

    You can verify your installation by running:

    ```bash
    rustup show
    rustup +nightly show
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"
    ><span class="file-path"></span>rustup show <br />
    rustup +nightly show</span
  >
  <span data-ty>active toolchain</span>
  <span data-ty>----------------</span>
  <span data-ty></span>
  <span data-ty>stable-aarch64-apple-darwin (default)</span>
  <span data-ty>rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)</span>
  <span data-ty></span>
  <span data-ty>active toolchain</span>
  <span data-ty>----------------</span>
  <span data-ty></span>
  <span data-ty>nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin (overridden by +toolchain on the command line) </span>
  <span data-ty>rustc 1.84.0-nightly (03ee48451 2024-11-18)</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

    Then, run the following commands to clone and build the Polkadot binary:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk polkadot-sdk
    cd polkadot-sdk
    cargo build --release
    ```

    Depending upon the specs of your machine, compiling the binary may take an hour or more. After building the Polkadot node from source, the executable binary will be located in the `./target/release/polkadot` directory.

??? interface "Windows"

    To get started, make sure that you have [WSL and Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10){target=\_blank} installed on your Windows machine.

    Once installed, you have a couple options for installing the Polkadot binary:

    - If Rust is installed, then `cargo` can be used similar to the macOS instructions
    - Or, the instructions in the Linux section can be used

??? interface "Linux (pre-built binary)"

    To grab the [latest release of the Polkadot binary](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases){target=\_blank}, you can use `wget`:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/download/polkadot-INSERT_VERSION/polkadot
    ```
    
    Ensure you note the executable binary's location, as you'll need to use it when running the start-up command. If you prefer, you can specify the output location of the executable binary with the `-O` flag, for example:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/download/polkadot-INSERT_VERSION/polkadot \
    - O /var/lib/polkadot-data/polkadot
    ```

    !!!tip
        The nature of pre-built binaries means that they may not work on your particular architecture or Linux distribution. If you see an error like `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error` it likely means the binary is incompatible with your system. You will either need to compile the binary or use [Docker](#use-docker).

    Ensure that you properly configure the permissions to make the Polkadot release binary executable:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x polkadot
    ```

??? interface "Linux (compile binary)"

    The most reliable (although perhaps not the fastest) way of launching a full node is to compile the binary yourself. Depending on your machine's specs, this may take an hour or more.

    To get started, run the following commands to configure the Rust toolchain:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable
    rustup update
    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
    rustup component add rust-src --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
    ```

    You can verify your installation by running:

    ```bash
    rustup show
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"
    ><span class="file-path"></span>rustup show <br />
    rustup +nightly show</span
  >
  <span data-ty>active toolchain</span>
  <span data-ty>----------------</span>
  <span data-ty></span>
  <span data-ty>stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)</span>
  <span data-ty>rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)</span>
</div>

    Once Rust is configured, run the following commands to clone and build Polkadot:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk polkadot-sdk
    cd polkadot-sdk
    cargo build --release
    ```

    Compiling the binary may take an hour or more, depending on your machine's specs. After building the Polkadot node from the source, the executable binary will be located in the `./target/release/polkadot` directory.

??? interface "Linux (snap package)"

    Polkadot can be installed as a [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/polkadot){target=\_blank}. If you don't already have Snap installed, take the following steps to install it:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install snapd
    ```

    Install the Polkadot snap package:

    ```bash
    sudo snap install polkadot
    ```
    
    Before continuing on with the following instructions, check out the [Configure and Run Your Node](#configure-and-run-your-node) section to learn more about the configuration options.

    To configure your Polkadot node with your desired options, you'll run a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    sudo snap set polkadot service-args="--name=MyName --chain=polkadot"
    ```

    Then to start the node service, run:

    ```bash
    sudo snap start polkadot
    ```

    You can review the logs to check on the status of the node: 

    ```bash
    snap logs polkadot -f
    ```

    And at any time, you can stop the node service:

    ```bash
    sudo snap stop polkadot
    ```

    You can optionally prevent the service from stopping when snap is updated with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo snap set polkadot endure=true
    ```

### Use Docker

As an additional option, you can use Docker to run your node in a container. Doing this is more advanced, so it's best left up to those already familiar with Docker or who have completed the other set-up instructions in this guide. You can review the latest versions on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/parity/polkadot/tags){target=\_blank}.

Be aware that when you run Polkadot in Docker, the process only listens on `localhost` by default. If you would like to connect to your node's services (RPC and Prometheus) you need to ensure that you run the node with the `--rpc-external`, and `--prometheus-external` commands.

```bash
docker run -p 9944:9944 -p 9615:9615 parity/polkadot:v1.16.2 --name "my-polkadot-node-calling-home" --rpc-external --prometheus-external
```

If you're running Docker on an Apple Silicon machine (e.g. M4), you'll need to adapt the command slightly:

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 9944:9944 -p 9615:9615 parity/polkadot:v1.16.2 --name "kearsarge-calling-home" --rpc-external --prometheus-external
```

## Configure and Run Your Node

Now that you've installed and built the Polkadot binary, the next step is to configure the start-up command depending on the type of node that you want to run. You'll need to modify the start-up command accordingly based on the location of the binary. In some cases, it may be located within the `./target/release/` folder, so you'll need to replace polkadot with `./target/release/polkadot` in the following commands.

Also, note that you can use the same binary for Polkadot as you would for Kusama or any other relay chain. You'll need to use the `--chain` flag to differentiate between chains.

If you aren't sure which type of node to run, see the [Types of Full Nodes](/infrastructure/running-a-node/#types-of-nodes){target=\_blank} section.

The base commands for running a Polkadot node are as follows:

=== "Default pruned node"

    This uses the default pruning value of the last 256 blocks:

    ```bash
    polkadot --chain polkadot \
    --name "INSERT_NODE_NAME"
    ```

=== "Custom pruned node"

    You can customize the pruning value, for example, to the last 1000 finalized blocks:

    ```bash
    polkadot --chain polkadot \
    --name INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME \
    --state-pruning 1000 \
    --blocks-pruning archive \
    --rpc-cors all \
    --rpc-methods safe
    ```

=== "Archive node"

    To support the full state, use the `archive` option:

    ```bash
    polkadot --chain polkadot \
    --name INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME \
    --state-pruning archive \
    --blocks-pruning archive \
    ```

If you want to run an RPC node, please refer to the following [RPC Configurations](#rpc-configurations) section.

To review a complete list of the available commands, flags, and options, you can use the `--help` flag:

```bash
polkadot --help
```

Once you've fully configured your start-up command, you can execute it in your terminal and your node will start [syncing](#sync-your-node).

### RPC Configurations

The node startup settings allow you to choose what to expose, how many connections to expose, and which systems should be granted access through the RPC server.

- You can limit the methods to use with `--rpc-methods`; an easy way to set this to a safe mode is `--rpc-methods safe`
- You can set your maximum connections through `--rpc-max-connections`, for example, `--rpc-max-connections 200`
- By default, localhost and Polkadot.js can access the RPC server. You can change this by setting `--rpc-cors`. To allow access from everywhere, you can use `--rpc-cors all`

For a list of important flags when running RPC nodes, refer to the Parity DevOps documentation: [Important Flags for Running an RPC Node](https://paritytech.github.io/devops-guide/guides/rpc_index.html?#important-flags-for-running-an-rpc-node){target=\_blank}.

## Sync Your Node

The syncing process will take a while, depending on your capacity, processing power, disk speed, and RAM. The process may be completed on a $10 DigitalOcean droplet in about ~36 hours. While syncing, your node name should be visible in gray on Polkadot Telemetry, and once it is fully synced, your node name will appear in white on [Polkadot Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Polkadot){target=_blank}.

A healthy node syncing blocks will output logs like the following:

title: Set Up Secure WebSocket
description: Instructions on enabling SSL for your node and setting up a secure WebSocket proxy server using nginx for remote connections.
---

# Set Up Secure WebSocket

## Introduction

Ensuring secure WebSocket communication is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of a Polkadot or Kusama node when interacting with remote clients. This guide walks you through setting up a secure WebSocket (WSS) connection for your node by leveraging SSL encryption with popular web server proxies like nginx or Apache.

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to secure your node's WebSocket port, enabling safe remote connections without exposing your node to unnecessary risks. The instructions in this guide are for UNIX-based systems.

## Secure a WebSocket Port

You can convert a non-secured WebSocket port to a secure WSS port by placing it behind an SSL-enabled proxy. This approach can be used to secure a bootnode or RPC server. The SSL-enabled apache2/nginx/other proxy server redirects requests to the internal WebSocket and converts it to a secure (WSS) connection. You can use a service like [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){target=\_blank} to obtain an SSL certificate.

### Obtain an SSL Certificate

LetsEncrypt suggests using the [Certbot ACME client](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/#with-shell-access/){target=\_blank} for your respective web server implementation to get a free SSL certificate:

- [nginx](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal){target=\_blank}
- [apache2](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=apache&os=ubuntufocal){target=\_blank}
 
LetsEncrypt will auto-generate an SSL certificate and include it in your configuration.

When connecting, you can generate a self-signed certificate and rely on your node's raw IP address. However, self-signed certificates aren't optimal because you must include the certificate in an allowlist to access it from a browser.

Use the following command to generate a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL:

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned.crt
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
```

## Install a Proxy Server

There are a lot of different implementations of a WebSocket proxy; some of the more widely used are [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/){target=\_blank} and [apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/){target=\_blank}, both of which are commonly used web server implementations. See the following section for configuration examples for both implementations.

### Use nginx

1. Install the `nginx` web server: 
    ```bash
    apt install nginx
    ```

2. In an SSL-enabled virtual host, add:
    ```conf
server {
    (...)
    location / {
    proxy_buffers 16 4k;
    proxy_buffer_size 2k;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9944;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

3. Optionally, you can introduce some form of rate limiting:
    ```conf
http {
    limit_req_zone  "$http_x_forwarded_for" zone=zone:10m rate=2r/s;
    (...)
}
location / {
    limit_req zone=zone burst=5;
    (...)
}
```

### Use Apache2

Apache2 can run in various modes, including `prefork`, `worker`, and `event`. In this example, the [`event`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/event.html){target=\_blank} mode is recommended for handling higher traffic loads, as it is optimized for performance in such environments. However, depending on the specific requirements of your setup, other modes like `prefork` or `worker` may also be appropriate.

1. Install the `apache2` web server:
    ```bash
apt install apache2
a2dismod mpm_prefork
a2enmod mpm_event proxy proxy_html proxy_http proxy_wstunnel rewrite ssl
```

2. The [`mod_proxy_wstunnel`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html){target=\_blank} provides support for the tunneling of WebSocket connections to a backend WebSocket server. The connection is automatically upgraded to a WebSocket connection. In an SSL-enabled virtual host add:
    ```apacheconf
# (...)
SSLProxyEngine on
ProxyRequests off
ProxyPass / ws://localhost:9944
ProxyPassReverse / ws://localhost:9944
```

    !!!warning 
        Older versions of `mod_proxy_wstunnel` don't upgrade the connection automatically and will need the following config added:
        ```apacheconf
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
        RewriteRule /(.*) ws://localhost:9944/$1 [P,L]
        RewriteRule /(.*) http://localhost:9944/$1 [P,L]
        ```

3. Optionally, some form of rate limiting can be introduced by first running the following command:

    ```bash
    apt install libapache2-mod-qos
    a2enmod qos
    ```

    Then edit `/etc/apache2/mods-available/qos.conf` as follows:

    ```conf
    # allows max 50 connections from a single IP address:
    QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP                                 50
    ```

## Connect to the Node

1. Open [Polkadot.js Apps interface](https://polkadot.js.org/apps){target=\_blank} and click the logo in the top left to switch the node
2. Activate the **Development** toggle and input either your node's domain or IP address. Remember to prefix with `wss://` and, if you're using the 443 port, append `:443` as follows:

    ```bash
    wss://example.com:443
    ```

# Key Management

## Introduction

After setting up your node environment as shown in the [Setup](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator){target=\_blank} section, you'll need to configure multiple keys for your validator to operate properly. This includes setting up session keys, which are essential for participating in the consensus process, and configuring a node key that maintains a stable network identity. This guide walks you through the key management process, showing you how to generate, store, and register these keys.

## Set Session Keys

Setting up your validator's session keys is essential to associate your node with your stash account on the Polkadot network. Validators use session keys to participate in the consensus process. Your validator can only perform its role in the network by properly setting session keys which consist of several key pairs for different parts of the protocol (e.g., GRANDPA, BABE). These keys must be registered on-chain and associated with your validator node to ensure it can participate in validating blocks.

### Generate Session Keys

There are multiple ways to create the session keys. It can be done by interacting with the [Polkadot.js Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank}, using the curl command or by using [Subkey](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/subkey/index.html){target=\_blank}.

=== "Polkadot.js Apps UI"

    1. In Polkadot.js Apps, connect to your local node, navigate to the **Developer** dropdown, and select the **RPC Calls** option

    2. Construct an `author_rotateKeys` RPC call and execute it

        1. Select the **author** endpoint
        2. Choose the **rotateKeys()** call
        3. Click the **Submit RPC Call** button
        4. Copy the hex-encoded public key from the response

        ![](/images/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/key-management/key-management-1.webp)

=== "Curl"

    Generate session keys by running the following command on your validator node:

    ``` bash
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' \
    http://localhost:9944
    ```

    This command will return a JSON object. The `result` key is the hex-encoded public part of the newly created session key. Save this for later use.
    
    ```json
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0xda3861a45e0197f3ca145c2c209f9126e5053fas503e459af4255cf8011d51010","id":1}
    ```

=== "Subkey"

    To create a keypair for your node's session keys, use the `subkey generate` command. This generates a set of cryptographic keys that must be stored in your node's keystore directory.

    When you run the command, it produces output similar to this example:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>subkey generate</span>
  <pre>
Secret phrase:       twist buffalo mixture excess device drastic vague mammal fitness punch match hammer
  Network ID:        substrate
  Secret seed:       0x5faa9e5defe42b201388d5c2b8202d6625a344abc9aa52943a71f12cb90b88a9
  Public key (hex):  0x28cc2fdb6e28835e2bbac9a16feb65c23d448c9314ef12fe083b61bab8fc2755
  Account ID:        0x28cc2fdb6e28835e2bbac9a16feb65c23d448c9314ef12fe083b61bab8fc2755
  Public key (SS58): 5CzCRpXzHYhuo6G3gYFR3cgV6X3qCNwVt51m8q14ZcChsSXQ
  SS58 Address:      5CzCRpXzHYhuo6G3gYFR3cgV6X3qCNwVt51m8q14ZcChsSXQ
  </pre>
</div>

    To properly store these keys, create a file in your keystore directory with a specific naming convention. The filename must consist of the hex string `61757261` (which represents "aura" in hex) followed by the public key without its `0x` prefix.

    Using the example above, you would create a file named:

    ```
    ./keystores/6175726128cc2fdb6e28835e2bbac9a16feb65c23d448c9314ef12fe083b61bab8fc2755
    ```

    And store only the secret phrase in the file:

    ```
    "twist buffalo mixture excess device drastic vague mammal fitness punch match hammer"
    ```

### Submit Transaction to Set Keys

Now that you have generated your session keys, you must submit them to the chain. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Network > Staking > Accounts** section on Polkadot.js Apps
2. Select **Set Session Key** on the bonding account you generated earlier
3. Paste the hex-encoded session key string you generated (from either the UI or CLI) into the input field and submit the transaction

![](/images/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/key-management/key-management-2.webp)

Once the transaction is signed and submitted, your session keys will be registered on-chain.

### Verify Session Key Setup

To verify that your session keys are properly set, you can use one of two RPC calls:

- **`hasKey`** - checks if the node has a specific key by public key and key type
- **`hasSessionKeys`** - verifies if your node has the full session key string associated with the validator

For example, you can [check session keys on the Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/rpc){target=\_blank} interface or by running an RPC query against your node. Once this is done, your validator node is ready for its role.

## Set the Node Key

Validators on Polkadot need a static network key (also known as the node key) to maintain a stable node identity. This key ensures that your validator can maintain a consistent peer ID, even across restarts, which is crucial for maintaining reliable network connections.

Starting with Polkadot version 1.11, validators without a stable network key may encounter the following error on startup:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>polkadot --validator --name "INSERT_NAME_FROM_TELEMETRY"</span>
  <span data-ty>Error:</span>
  <span data-ty>0: Starting an authority without network key</span>
  <span data-ty>This is not a safe operation because other authorities in the network may depend on your node having a stable identity.</span>
  <span data-ty>Otherwise these other authorities may not being able to reach you.</span>
  <span data-ty>If it is the first time running your node you could use one of the following methods:</span>
  <span data-ty>1. [Preferred] Separately generate the key with: INSERT_NODE_BINARY key generate-node-key --base-path INSERT_YOUR_BASE_PATH</span>
  <span data-ty>2. [Preferred] Separately generate the key with: INSERT_NODE_BINARY key generate-node-key --file INSERT_YOUR_PATH_TO_NODE_KEY</span>
  <span data-ty>3. [Preferred] Separately generate the key with: INSERT_NODE_BINARY key generate-node-key --default-base-path</span>
  <span data-ty>4. [Unsafe] Pass --unsafe-force-node-key-generation and make sure you remove it for subsequent node restarts</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

### Generate the Node Key

Use one of the following methods to generate your node key:

=== "Save to file"

    The recommended solution is to generate a node key and save it to a file using the following command:

    ``` bash
    polkadot key generate-node-key --file INSERT_PATH_TO_NODE_KEY
    ```
    
=== "Use default path"

    You can also generate the node key with the following command, which will automatically save the key to the base path of your node:

    ``` bash
    polkadot key generate-node-key --default-base-path
    ```

Save the file path for reference. You will need it in the next step to configure your node with a static identity.

### Set Node Key

After generating the node key, configure your node to use it by specifying the path to the key file when launching your node. Add the following flag to your validator node's startup command:

``` bash
polkadot --node-key-file INSERT_PATH_TO_NODE_KEY
```

Following these steps ensures that your node retains its identity, making it discoverable by peers without the risk of conflicting identities across sessions. For further technical background, see Polkadot SDK [Pull Request #3852](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3852){target=\_blank} for the rationale behind requiring static keys.

# Set Up a Validator

## Introduction

Setting up a Polkadot validator node is essential for securing the network and earning staking rewards. This guide walks you through the technical steps to set up a validator, from installing the necessary software to managing keys and synchronizing your node with the chain.

Running a validator requires a commitment to maintaining a stable, secure infrastructure. Validators are responsible for their own stakes and those of nominators who trust them with their tokens. Proper setup and ongoing management are critical to ensuring smooth operation and avoiding potential penalties such as slashing.

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this guide, ensure you've done the following before going forward:

- Read [Validator Requirements](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/requirements/){target=\_blank} and understand the recommended minimum skill level and hardware needs
- Read [General Management](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management){target=\_blank}, [Upgrade Your Node](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/upgrade-your-node/){target=\_blank}, and [Pause Validating](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/stop-validating/){target=\_blank} and understand the tasks required to keep your validator operational
- Read [Rewards Payout](/infrastructure/staking-mechanics/rewards-payout/){target=\_blank} and understand how validator rewards are determined and paid out
- Read [Offenses and Slashes](/infrastructure/staking-mechanics/offenses-and-slashes/){target=\_blank} and understand how validator performance and security can affect tokens staked by you or your nominators

## Initial Setup

Before running your validator, you must configure your server environment to meet the operational and security standards required for validating.

You must use a Linux-based operating system with Kernel 5.16 or later. Configuration includes setting up time synchronization, ensuring critical security features are active, and installing the necessary binaries. Proper setup at this stage is essential to prevent issues like block production errors or being penalized for downtime. Below are the essential steps to get your system ready.

### Install Network Time Protocol Client

Accurate timekeeping is critical to ensure your validator is synchronized with the network. Validators need local clocks in sync with the blockchain to avoid missing block authorship opportunities. Using [Network Time Protocol (NTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol){target=\_blank} is the standard solution to keep your system's clock accurate.

If you are using Ubuntu version 18.04 or newer, the NTP Client should be installed by default. You can check whether you have the NTP client by running:

```sh
timedatectl
```

If NTP is running, you should see a message like the following:

``` sh
System clock synchronized: yes
```

If NTP is not installed or running, you can install it using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ntp
```

After installation, NTP will automatically start. To check its status:

```sh
sudo ntpq -p
```

This command will return a message with the status of the NTP synchronization. Skipping this step could result in your validator node missing blocks due to minor clock drift, potentially affecting its network performance.

### Verify Landlock is Activated

[Landlock](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html){target=\_blank} is an important security feature integrated into Linux kernels starting with version 5.13. It allows processes, even those without special privileges, to limit their access to the system to reduce the machine's attack surface. This feature is crucial for validators, as it helps ensure the security and stability of the node by preventing unauthorized access or malicious behavior.

To use Landlock, ensure you use the reference kernel or newer versions. Most Linux distributions should already have Landlock activated. You can check if Landlock is activated on your machine by running the following command as root:

```sh
dmesg | grep landlock || journalctl -kg landlock
```

If Landlock is not activated, your system logs won't show any related output. In this case, you will need to activate it manually or ensure that your Linux distribution supports it. Most modern distributions with the required kernel version should have Landlock activated by default. However, if your system lacks support, you may need to build the kernel with Landlock activated. For more information on doing so, refer to the [official kernel documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#kernel-support){target=\_blank}.

Implementing Landlock ensures your node operates in a restricted, self-imposed sandbox, limiting potential damage from security breaches or bugs. While not a mandatory requirement, enabling this feature greatly improves the security of your validator setup.

## Install the Polkadot Binaries

You must install the Polkadot binaries required to run your validator node. These binaries include the main `polkadot`, `polkadot-prepare-worker`, and `polkadot-execute-worker` binaries. All three are needed to run a fully functioning validator node.

Depending on your preference and operating system setup, there are multiple methods to install these binaries. Below are the main options:

### Install from Official Releases

The preferred, most straightforward method to install the required binaries is downloading the latest versions from the official releases. You can visit the [Github Releases](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases){target=\_blank} page for the most current versions of the `polkadot`, `polkadot-prepare-worker`, and `polkadot-execute-worker` binaries.

You can also download the binaries by using the following direct links:

    # Download the binary
    curl -LO https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/download/{{ dependencies.polkadot_sdk.version }}/polkadot-execute-worker

    # Verify signature
    curl -LO https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/download/{{ dependencies.polkadot_sdk.version }}/polkadot-execute-worker.asc

    gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --receive-keys 90BD75EBBB8E95CB3DA6078F94A4029AB4B35DAE

    gpg --verify polkadot-execute-worker.asc
    ```


Signature verification cryptographically ensures the downloaded binaries are authentic and have not been tampered with by using GPG signing keys. Polkadot releases use two different signing keys:

- ParityReleases (release-team@parity.io) with key [`90BD75EBBB8E95CB3DA6078F94A4029AB4B35DAE`](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=9D4B2B6EB8F97156D19669A9FF0812D491B96798&fingerprint=on&op=index){target=\_blank} for current and new releases
- Parity Security Team (security@parity.io) with key [`9D4B2B6EB8F97156D19669A9FF0812D491B96798`](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=90BD75EBBB8E95CB3DA6078F94A4029AB4B35DAE&fingerprint=on&op=index){target=\_blank} for old releases

    !!!warning
        When verifying a signature, a "Good signature" message indicates successful verification, while any other output signals a potential security risk.

### Install with Package Managers

Users running Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, or RPM-based distributions such as Fedora or CentOS can install the binaries via package managers.

??? interface "Debian-based (Debian, Ubuntu)"

    Run the following commands as the root user to add the necessary repository and install the binaries:

    ```ssh
    # Import the security@parity.io GPG key
    gpg --recv-keys --keyserver hkps://keys.mailvelope.com 9D4B2B6EB8F97156D19669A9FF0812D491B96798
    gpg --export 9D4B2B6EB8F97156D19669A9FF0812D491B96798 > /usr/share/keyrings/parity.gpg
    # Add the Parity repository and update the package index
    echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/parity.gpg] https://releases.parity.io/deb release main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/parity.list
    apt update
    # Install the `parity-keyring` package - This will ensure the GPG key
    # used by APT remains up-to-date
    apt install parity-keyring
    # Install polkadot
    apt install polkadot
    ```
    
    After installation, ensure the binaries are properly installed by [verifying the installation](#verify-installation).

??? interface "RPM-based (Fedora, CentOS)""

    Run the following commands as the root user to install the binaries on an RPM-based system:

    ```bash
    # Install dnf-plugins-core (This might already be installed)
    dnf install dnf-plugins-core
    # Add the repository and activate it
    dnf config-manager --add-repo https://releases.parity.io/rpm/polkadot.repo
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled polkadot
    # Install polkadot (You may have to confirm the import of the GPG key, which
    # should have the following fingerprint: 9D4B2B6EB8F97156D19669A9FF0812D491B96798)
    dnf install polkadot
    ```

    After installation, ensure the binaries are properly installed by [verifying the installation](#verify-installation).

### Install with Ansible

You can also manage Polkadot installations using Ansible. This approach can be beneficial for users managing multiple validator nodes or requiring automated deployment. The [Parity chain operations Ansible collection](https://github.com/paritytech/ansible-galaxy/){target=\_blank} provides a Substrate node role for this purpose.

### Install with Docker

If you prefer using Docker or an OCI-compatible container runtime, the official Polkadot Docker image can be pulled directly from Docker Hub.

To pull the latest stable image, run the following command:

```bash
docker pull parity/polkadot:{{ dependencies.polkadot_sdk.docker_image_version }}
```

### Build from Sources

You may build the binaries from source by following the instructions on the [Polkadot SDK repository](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/polkadot#building){target=\_blank}.

## Verify Installation

Once the Polkadot binaries are installed, it's essential to verify that everything is set up correctly and that all the necessary components are in place. Follow these steps to ensure the binaries are installed and functioning as expected.

1. **Check the versions** - run the following commands to verify the versions of the installed binaries:

    ```bash
    polkadot --version
    polkadot-execute-worker --version
    polkadot-prepare-worker --version
    ```

    The output should show the version numbers for each of the binaries. Ensure that the versions match and are consistent, similar to the following example (the specific version may vary):

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>polkadot --version polkadot-execute-worker --version polkadot-prepare-worker --version</span>
  <span data-ty>1.16.1-36264cb36db</span>
  <span data-ty>1.16.1-36264cb36db</span>
  <span data-ty>1.16.1-36264cb36db</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

    If the versions do not match or if there is an error, double-check that all the binaries were correctly installed and are accessible within your `$PATH`.

2. **Ensure all binaries are in the same directory** - all the binaries must be in the same directory for the Polkadot validator node to function properly. If the binaries are not in the same location, move them to a unified directory and ensure this directory is added to your system's `$PATH`

    To verify the `$PATH`, run the following command:

    ```bash
    echo $PATH
    ```

    If necessary, you can move the binaries to a shared location, such as `/usr/local/bin/`, and add it to your `$PATH`.

# Start Validating

## Introduction

After configuring your node keys as shown in the [Key Management](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/key-management){target=\_blank} section and ensuring your system is set up, you're ready to begin the validator setup process. This guide will walk you through choosing a network, synchronizing your node with the blockchain, bonding your DOT tokens, and starting your validator.

## Choose a Network

Running your validator on a test network like Westend or Kusama is a smart way to familiarize yourself with the process and identify any setup issues in a lower-stakes environment before joining the Polkadot MainNet.

- **Westend** - Polkadot's primary TestNet is open to anyone for testing purposes. Validator slots are intentionally limited to keep the network stable for the Polkadot release process, so it may not support as many validators at any given time
- **Kusama** - often called Polkadot's "canary network," Kusama has real economic value but operates with a faster and more experimental approach. Running a validator here provides an experience closer to MainNet with the benefit of more frequent validation opportunities with an era time of 6 hours vs 24 hours for Polkadot
- **Polkadot** - the main network, where validators secure the Polkadot relay chain. It has a slower era time of 24 hours and requires a higher minimum bond amount to participate

## Synchronize Chain Data

The next step is to sync your node with the chosen blockchain network. Synchronization is necessary to download and validate the blockchain data, ensuring your node is ready to participate as a validator. Follow these steps to sync your node:

1. **Start syncing** - you can run a full or warp sync

    === "Full sync"

        Polkadot defaults to using a full sync, which downloads and validates the entire blockchain history from the genesis block. Start the syncing process by running the following command:

        ```sh
        polkadot
        ```

        This command starts your Polkadot node in non-validator mode, allowing you to synchronize the chain data.

    === "Warp sync"

        You can opt to use warp sync which initially downloads only GRANDPA finality proofs and the latest finalized block's state. Use the following command to start a warp sync:

        ``` bash
        polkadot --sync warp
        ```

        Warp sync ensures that your node quickly updates to the latest finalized state. The historical blocks are downloaded in the background as the node continues to operate.

    If you're planning to run a validator on a TestNet, you can specify the chain using the `--chain` flag. For example, the following will run a validator on Kusama:

    ```sh
    polkadot --chain=kusama
    ```

2. **Monitor sync progress** - once the sync starts, you will see a stream of logs providing information about the node's status and progress. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>polkadot</span>
  <span data-ty>2021-06-17 03:07:07 Parity Polkadot</span>

  <span data-ty>...</span>
</div>

    The output logs provide information such as the current block number, node name, and network connections. Monitor the sync progress and any errors that might occur during the process. Look for information about the latest processed block and compare it with the current highest block using tools like [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Polkadot%20CC1){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank}.

### Database Snapshot Services

If you'd like to speed up the process further, you can use a database snapshot. Snapshots are compressed backups of the blockchain's database directory and can significantly reduce the time required to sync a new node. Here are a few public snapshot providers:

- [Stakeworld](https://stakeworld.io/snapshot){target=\_blank}
- [Polkachu](https://polkachu.com/substrate_snapshots){target=\_blank}
- [Polkashots](https://polkashots.io/){target=\_blank}

!!!warning
    Although snapshots are convenient, syncing from scratch is recommended for security purposes. If snapshots become corrupted and most nodes rely on them, the network could inadvertently run on a non-canonical chain.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>polkadot</span>
  <span data-ty>2021-06-17 03:07:07 Idle (0 peers), best: #0 (0x3fd7...5baf), finalized #0 (0x3fd7...5baf), ⬇ 2.9kiB/s ⬆ 3.7kiB/s</span>

  <span data-ty>...</span>
</div>

If you see terminal output similar to the preceding, and you are unable to synchronize the chain due to having zero peers, make sure you have libp2p port `30333` activated. It will take some time to discover other peers over the network.

## Bond DOT

Once your validator node is synced, the next step is bonding DOT. A bonded account, or stash, holds your staked tokens (DOT) that back your validator node. Bonding your DOT means locking it for a period, during which it cannot be transferred or spent but is used to secure your validator's role in the network. Visit the [Minimum Bond Requirement](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/requirements/#minimum-bond-requirement) section for details on how much DOT is required.

The following sections will guide you through bonding DOT for your validator.

### Bonding DOT on Polkadot.js Apps

Once you're ready to bond your DOT, head over to the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} staking page by clicking the **Network** dropdown at the top of the page and selecting [**Staking**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/actions){target=\_blank}.

To get started with the bond submission, click on the **Accounts** tab, then the **+ Stash** button, and then enter the following information:

1. **Stash account** - select your stash account (which is the account with the DOT/KSM balance)
2. **Value bonded** - enter how much DOT from the stash account you want to bond/stake. You are not required to bond all of the DOT in that account and you may bond more DOT at a later time. Be aware, withdrawing any bonded amount requires waiting for the unbonding period. The unbonding period is seven days for Kusama and 28 days for Polkadot
3. **Payment destination** - add the recipient account for validator rewards. If you'd like to redirect payments to an account that is not the stash account, you can do it by entering the address here. Note that it is extremely unsafe to set an exchange address as the recipient of the staking rewards

Once everything is filled in properly, select **Bond** and sign the transaction with your stash account. If successful, you should see an `ExtrinsicSuccess` message.

Your bonded account will be available under **Stashes**. After refreshing the screen, you should now see a card with all your accounts. The bonded amount on the right corresponds to the funds bonded by the stash account.

## Validate

Once your validator node is fully synced and ready, the next step is to ensure it's visible on the network and performing as expected. Below are steps for monitoring and managing your node on the Polkadot network.

### Verify Sync via Telemetry

To confirm that your validator is live and synchronized with the Polkadot network, visit the [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Polkadot%20CC1){target=\_blank} page. Telemetry provides real-time information on node performance and can help you check if your validator is connected properly. Search for your node by name. You can search all nodes currently active on the network, which is why you should use a unique name for easy recognition. Now, confirm that your node is fully synced by comparing the block height of your node with the network's latest block. Nodes that are fully synced will appear white in the list, while nodes that are not yet fully synced will appear gray.

In the following example, a node named `techedtest` is successfully located and synchronized, ensuring it's prepared to participate in the network:

![Polkadot telemetry dashboard](/images/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/set-up-a-validator-02.webp)

### Activate using Polkadot.js Apps

Follow these steps to use Polkadot.js Apps to activate your validator:

1. Go to the **Validator** tab in the Polkadot.js Apps UI and locate the section where you input the keys generated from `rotateKeys`. Paste the output from `author_rotateKeys`, which is a hex-encoded key that links your validator with its session keys:

    ![](/images/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/set-up-a-validator-03.webp)

2. Set a reward commission percentage if desired. You can set a percentage of the rewards to pay to your validator and the remainder pays to your nominators. A 100% commission rate indicates the validator intends to keep all rewards and is seen as a signal the validator is not seeking nominators
3. Toggle the **allows new nominations** option if your validator is open to more nominations from DOT holders
4. Once everything is configured, select **Bond & Validate** to activate your validator status

    ![](/images/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/set-up-a-validator-04.webp)

### Monitor Validation Status and Slots

On the [**Staking**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking){target=\_blank} tab in Polkadot.js Apps, you can see your validator's status, the number of available validator slots, and the nodes that have signaled their intent to validate. Your node may initially appear in the waiting queue, especially if the validator slots are full. The following is an example view of the **Staking** tab:

![staking queue](/images/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/set-up-a-validator-05.webp)

The validator set refreshes each era. If there's an available slot in the next era, your node may be selected to move from the waiting queue to the active validator set, allowing it to start validating blocks. If your validator is not selected, it remains in the waiting queue. Increasing your stake or gaining more nominators may improve your chance of being selected in future eras.

## Run a Validator Using Systemd

Running your Polkadot validator as a [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd){target=\_blank} service is an effective way to ensure its high uptime and reliability. Using systemd allows your validator to automatically restart after server reboots or unexpected crashes, significantly reducing the risk of slashing due to downtime.

This following sections will walk you through creating and managing a systemd service for your validator, allowing you to seamlessly monitor and control it as part of your Linux system. 

Ensure the following requirements are met before proceeding with the systemd setup:

- Confirm your system meets the [requirements](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/requirements/){target=\_blank} for running a validator
- Ensure you meet the [minimum bond requirements](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/chain-state-values#minimum-validator-bond){target=\_blank} for validating
- Verify the Polkadot binary is [installed](#install-the-polkadot-binaries)

### Create the Systemd Service File

First create a new unit file called `polkadot-validator.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`:

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/polkadot-validator.service
```

In this unit file, you will write the commands that you want to run on server boot/restart:

```systemd title="/etc/systemd/system/polkadot-validator.service"
[Unit]
Description=Polkadot Node
After=network.target

SystemCallFilter=pivot_root
UMask=0027

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

!!! warning "Restart delay and equivocation risk"
    It is recommended that a node's restart be delayed with `RestartSec` in the case of a crash. It's possible that when a node crashes, consensus votes in GRANDPA aren't persisted to disk. In this case, there is potential to equivocate when immediately restarting. Delaying the restart will allow the network to progress past potentially conflicting votes.

### Run the Service

Activate the systemd service to start on system boot by running:

```bash
systemctl enable polkadot-validator.service
```

To start the service manually, use:

```bash
systemctl start polkadot-validator.service
```

Check the service's status to confirm it is running:

```bash
systemctl status polkadot-validator.service
```

To view the logs in real-time, use [journalctl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/journalctl.html){target=\_blank} like so:

```bash
journalctl -f -u polkadot-validator
```

With these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your validator as a systemd service.

Once your validator is active, it's officially part of Polkadot's security infrastructure. For questions or further support, you can reach out to the [Polkadot Validator chat](https://matrix.to/#/!NZrbtteFeqYKCUGQtr:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=web3.foundation){target=\_blank} for tips and troubleshooting.

# Stop Validating

## Introduction

If you're ready to stop validating on Polkadot, there are essential steps to ensure a smooth transition while protecting your funds and account integrity. Whether you're taking a break for maintenance or unbonding entirely, you'll need to chill your validator, purge session keys, and unbond your tokens. This guide explains how to use Polkadot's tools and extrinsics to safely withdraw from validation activities, safeguarding your account's future usability.

## Pause Versus Stop

If you wish to remain a validator or nominator (for example, stopping for planned downtime or server maintenance), submitting the `chill` extrinsic in the `staking` pallet should suffice. Additional steps are only needed to unbond funds or reap an account.

The following are steps to ensure a smooth stop to validation:

- Chill the validator
- Purge validator session keys
- Unbond your tokens

## Chill Validator

When stepping back from validating, the first step is to chill your validator status. This action stops your validator from being considered for the next era without fully unbonding your tokens, which can be useful for temporary pauses like maintenance or planned downtime.

Use the `staking.chill` extrinsic to initiate this. For more guidance on chilling your node, refer to the [Pause Validating](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/pause-validating/){target=\_blank} guide. You may also claim any pending staking rewards at this point.

## Purge Validator Session Keys

Purging validator session keys is a critical step in removing the association between your validator account and its session keys, which ensures that your account is fully disassociated from validator activities. The `session.purgeKeys` extrinsic removes the reference to your session keys from the stash or staking proxy account that originally set them.

Here are a couple of important things to know about purging keys:

- **Account used to purge keys** - always use the same account to purge keys you originally used to set them, usually your stash or staking proxy account. Using a different account may leave an unremovable reference to the session keys on the original account, preventing its reaping
- **Account reaping issue** - failing to purge keys will prevent you from reaping (fully deleting) your stash account. If you attempt to transfer tokens without purging, you'll need to rebond, purge the session keys, unbond again, and wait through the unbonding period before any transfer

## Unbond Your Tokens

After chilling your node and purging session keys, the final step is to unbond your staked tokens. This action removes them from staking and begins the unbonding period (usually 28 days for Polkadot and seven days for Kusama), after which the tokens will be transferable.

To unbond tokens, go to **Network > Staking > Account Actions** on Polkadot.js Apps. Select your stash account, click on the dropdown menu, and choose **Unbond Funds**. Alternatively, you can use the `staking.unbond` extrinsic if you handle this via a staking proxy account.

Once the unbonding period is complete, your tokens will be available for use in transactions or transfers outside of staking.

# General Management

## Introduction

Validator performance is pivotal in maintaining the security and stability of the Polkadot network. As a validator, optimizing your setup ensures efficient transaction processing, minimizes latency, and maintains system reliability during high-demand periods. Proper configuration and proactive monitoring also help mitigate risks like slashing and service interruptions.

This guide covers essential practices for managing a validator, including performance tuning techniques, security hardening, and tools for real-time monitoring. Whether you're fine-tuning CPU settings, configuring NUMA balancing, or setting up a robust alert system, these steps will help you build a resilient and efficient validator operation.

## Configuration Optimization

For those seeking to optimize their validator's performance, the following configurations can improve responsiveness, reduce latency, and ensure consistent performance during high-demand periods.

### Deactivate Simultaneous Multithreading

Polkadot validators operate primarily in single-threaded mode for critical tasks, so optimizing single-core CPU performance can reduce latency and improve stability. Deactivating simultaneous multithreading (SMT) can prevent virtual cores from affecting performance. SMT is called Hyper-Threading on Intel and 2-way SMT on AMD Zen.

Take the following steps to deactivate every other (vCPU) core:

1. Loop though all the CPU cores and deactivate the virtual cores associated with them:

    ```bash
    for cpunum in $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/thread_siblings_list | \
    cut -s -d, -f2- | tr ',' '\n' | sort -un)
    do
    echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$cpunum/online
    done
    ```

2. To permanently save the changes, add `nosmt=force` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable in `/etc/default/grub`:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    # Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
    ```

    ```config title="/etc/default/grub"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/grub-config-01.js:1:7'
    ```

3. Update GRUB to apply changes:

    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    ```

4. After the reboot, you should see that half of the cores are offline. To confirm, run:

    ```bash
    lscpu --extended
    ```

### Deactivate Automatic NUMA Balancing

Deactivating NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) balancing for multi-CPU setups helps keep processes on the same CPU node, minimizing latency.

Follow these stpes:

1. Deactivate NUMA balancing in runtime:

    ```bash
    sysctl kernel.numa_balancing=0
    ```

2. Deactivate NUMA balancing permanently by adding `numa_balancing=disable` to the GRUB settings:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    # Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
    ```

    ```config title="/etc/default/grub"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/grub-config-01.js:9:15'
    ```

3. Update GRUB to apply changes:

    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    ```

4. Confirm the deactivation:

    ```bash
    sysctl -a | grep 'kernel.numa_balancing'
    ```

If you successfully deactivated NUMA balancing, the preceding command should return `0`.

### Spectre and Meltdown Mitigations

[Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)){target=\_blank} and [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)){target=\_blank} are well-known CPU vulnerabilities that exploit speculative execution to access sensitive data. These vulnerabilities have been patched in recent Linux kernels, but the mitigations can slightly impact performance, especially in high-throughput or containerized environments.

If your security requirements allow it, you can deactivate specific mitigations, such as Spectre V2 and Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD), to improve performance.

To selectively deactivate the Spectre mitigations, take these steps:

1. Update the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable in your `/etc/default/grub` configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    # Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
    ```

    ```config title="/etc/default/grub"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/grub-config-01.js:17:23'
    ```

2. Update GRUB to apply changes and then reboot:

```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

This approach selectively deactivates the Spectre V2 and Spectre V4 mitigations, leaving other protections intact. For full security, keep mitigations activated unless there's a significant performance need, as disabling them could expose the system to potential attacks on affected CPUs.

## Monitor Your Node

Monitoring your node's performance is critical for network reliability and security. Tools like the following provide valuable insights:

- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank}** - an open-source monitoring toolkit for collecting and querying time-series data
- **[Grafana](https://grafana.com/){target=\_blank}** - a visualization tool for real-time metrics, providing interactive dashboards
- **[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/){target=\_blank}** - a tool for managing and routing alerts based on Prometheus data.

This section covers setting up these tools and configuring alerts to notify you of potential issues.

### Environment Setup

Before installing Prometheus, ensure the environment is set up securely by running Prometheus with restricted user privileges.

Follow these steps:

1. Create a Prometheus user to ensure Prometheus runs with minimal permissions:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus
    ```

2. Create directories for configuration and data storage:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
    ```
  
3. Change directory ownership to ensure Prometheus has access:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
    ```

### Install and Configure Prometheus

After setting up the environment, install and configure the latest version of Prometheus as follows:

1. Download Prometheus for your system architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/){target=\_blank}. Replace `INSERT_RELEASE_DOWNLOAD` with the release binary URL (e.g., `https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.0.0/prometheus-3.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz`):

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    wget INSERT_RELEASE_DOWNLOAD_LINK
    tar xfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
    cd prometheus-3.0.0.linux-amd64
    ```

2. Set up Prometheus:

    1. Copy binaries:

        ```bash
        sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
        sudo cp ./promtool /usr/local/bin/
        sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
        ```

    2. Copy directories and assign ownership of these files to the `prometheus` user:

        ```bash
        sudo cp -r ./consoles /etc/prometheus
        sudo cp -r ./console_libraries /etc/prometheus
        sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
        sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries
        ```

    3. Clean up the download directory:

        ```bash
        cd .. && rm -r prometheus*
        ```

3. Create `prometheus.yml` to define global settings, rule files, and scrape targets:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

    ```yaml title="prometheus-config.yml"
    global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'substrate_node'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9615']
    ```

    Prometheus is scraped every 5 seconds in this example configuration file, ensuring detailed internal metrics. Node metrics with customizable intervals are scraped from port `9615` by default.

4. Verify the configuration with `promtool`, an open source monitoring tool:

    ```bash
    promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

5. Save the configuration and change the ownership of the file to `prometheus` user:

    ```bash
    sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

### Start Prometheus

1. Launch Prometheus with the appropriate configuration file, storage location, and necessary web resources, running it with restricted privileges for security:

    ```bash
    sudo -u prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
    ```

    If you set the server up properly, you should see terminal output similar to the following:

    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/terminal-ouput-01.html'

2. Verify you can access the Prometheus interface by navigating to:

    ```text
    http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9090/graph
    ```

    If the interface appears to work as expected, exit the process using `Control + C`.

3. Create a systemd service file to ensure Prometheus starts on boot:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
    ```

    ```bash title="prometheus.service"
    [Unit]
Description=Prometheus Monitoring
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
 --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
 --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
 --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
 --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

4. Reload systemd and enable the service to start on boot:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable prometheus && sudo systemctl start prometheus
    ```

5. Verify the service is running by visiting the Prometheus interface again at:

    ```text
    http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9090/
    ```

### Install and Configure Alertmanager

[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/){target=\_blank} is an optional component that complements Prometheus by managing alerts and notifying users about potential issues.

Follow these steps to install and configure Alertmanager:

1. Download Alertmanager for your system architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases){target=\_blank}. Replace `INSERT_RELEASE_DOWNLOAD` with the release binary URL (e.g., `https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.28.0-rc.0/alertmanager-0.28.0-rc.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz`):

    ```bash
    wget INSERT_RELEASE_DOWNLOAD_LINK
    tar -xvzf alertmanager*
    ```

2. Copy the binaries to the system directory and set permissions:

    ```bash
    cd alertmanager-0.28.0-rc.0.linux-amd64
    sudo cp ./alertmanager /usr/local/bin/
    sudo cp ./amtool /usr/local/bin/
    sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/alertmanager
    sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/amtool
    ```

3. Create the `alertmanager.yml` configuration file under `/etc/alertmanager`:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /etc/alertmanager
    sudo nano /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
    ```

    Generate an [app password in your Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en){target=\_blank} to enable email notifications from Alertmanager. Then, add the following code to the configuration file to define email notifications using your  email and app password: 

    ```yml title="alertmanager.yml"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/alertmanager.yml'
    ```


    ```bash
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/alertmanager
    ```

5. Configure Alertmanager as a service by creating a systemd service file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service
    ```

    ```yml title="alertmanager.service"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/systemd-alert-config.md'
    ```

6. Reload and enable the service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable alertmanager
    sudo systemctl start alertmanager
    ```

7. Verify the service status:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status alertmanager
    ```

    If you have configured Alertmanager properly, the **Active** field should display **active (running)** similar to below:

    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/alertmanager-status.html'

#### Grafana Plugin

There is an [Alertmanager plugin in Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/alertmanager/){target=\_blank} that can help you monitor alert information.

Follow these steps to use the plugin:

1. Install the plugin:

    ```bash
    sudo grafana-cli plugins install camptocamp-prometheus-alertmanager-datasource
    ```

2. Restart Grafana:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
    ```

3. Configure Alertmanager as a data source in your Grafana dashboard (`SERVER_IP:3000`):

    1. Go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** and search for **Prometheus Alertmanager**
    2. Enter the server URL and port for the Alertmanager service, and select **Save & Test** to verify the connection

4. Import the [8010](https://grafana.com/dashboards/8010){target=\_blank} dashboard for Alertmanager, selecting **Prometheus Alertmanager** in the last column, then select **Import**

#### Integrate Alertmanager

Complete the integration by following these steps to enable communication between Prometheus and Alertmanager and configure detection and alert rules:

1. Update the `etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` configuration file to include the following code:

    ```yml title="prometheus.yml"
    - 'rules.yml'

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - localhost:9093
    ```

    Expand the following item to view the complete `prometheus.yml` file.

    ??? code "prometheus.yml"

        ```yml title="prometheus.yml"
        global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - 'rules.yml'

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - localhost:9093

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'substrate_node'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9615']
        ```

2. Create the rules file for detection and alerts:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/prometheus/rules.yml
    ```

    Add a sample rule to trigger email notifications for node downtime over five minutes:

    ```yml title="rules.yml"
    -8<-- 'code/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/instance-down.yml'
    ```

    If any of the conditions defined in the rules file are met, an alert will be triggered. For more on alert rules, refer to [Alerting Rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/){target=\_blank} and [additional alerts](https://awesome-prometheus-alerts.grep.to/rules.html){target=\_blank}.

3. Update the file ownership to `prometheus`:

    ```bash
    sudo chown prometheus:prometheus rules.yml
    ```

4. Validate the rules syntax:

    ```bash
    sudo -u prometheus promtool check rules rules.yml
    ```

5. Restart Prometheus and Alertmanager:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart prometheus && sudo systemctl restart alertmanager
    ```

Now you will receive an email alert if one of your rule triggering conditions is met. 
        
## Secure Your Validator

Validators in Polkadot's Proof of Stake (PoS) network play a critical role in maintaining network integrity and security by keeping the network in consensus and verifying state transitions. To ensure optimal performance and minimize risks, validators must adhere to strict guidelines around security and reliable operations.

### Key Management

Though they don't transfer funds, session keys are essential for validators as they sign messages related to consensus and parachains. Securing session keys is crucial as allowing them to be exploited or used across multiple nodes can lead to a loss of staked funds via [slashing](/infrastructure/staking-mechanics/offenses-and-slashes/){target=\_blank}.

Given the current limitations in high-availability setups and the risks associated with double-signing, it’s recommended to run only a single validator instance. Keys should be securely managed, and processes automated to minimize human error.

There are two approaches for generating session keys:

- **Generate and store in node** - using the `author.rotateKeys` RPC call. For most users, generating keys directly within the client is recommended. You must submit a session certificate from your staking proxy to register new keys. See the [How to Validate](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/){target=\_blank} guide for instructions on setting keys

- **Generate outside node and insert** - using the `author.setKeys` RPC call. This flexibility accommodates advanced security setups and should only be used by experienced validator operators

### Signing Outside the Client

Polkadot plans to support external signing, allowing session keys to reside in secure environments like Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). However, these modules can sign any payload they receive, potentially enabling an attacker to perform slashable actions.

### Secure-Validator Mode

Polkadot's Secure-Validator mode offers an extra layer of protection through strict filesystem, networking, and process sandboxing. This secure mode is activated by default if the machine meets the following requirements:

- **Linux (x86-64 architecture)** - usually Intel or AMD
- **Enabled `seccomp`** - this kernel feature facilitates a more secure approach for process management on Linux. Verify by running:

    ```bash
    cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_SECCOMP=
    ```

    If `seccomp` is enabled, you should see output similar to the following:

    ```bash
    CONFIG_SECCOMP=y
    ```

!!! tip 
    Optionally, **Linux 5.13** may also be used, as it provides access to even more strict filesystem protections.

### Linux Best Practices

Follow these best practices to keep your validator secure:

- Use a non-root user for all operations
- Regularly apply OS security patches
- Enable and configure a firewall
- Use key-based SSH authentication; deactivate password-based login
- Regularly back up data and harden your SSH configuration. Visit this [SSH guide](https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html){target=\_blank} for more details

### Validator Best Practices

Additional best practices can add an additional layer of security and operational reliability:

- Only run the Polkadot binary, and only listen on the configured p2p port
- Run on bare-metal machines, as opposed to virtual machines
- Provisioning of the validator machine should be automated and defined in code which is kept in private version control, reviewed, audited, and tested
- Generate and provide session keys in a secure way
- Start Polkadot at boot and restart if stopped for any reason
- Run Polkadot as a non-root user
- Establish and maintain an on-call rotation for managing alerts
- Establish and maintain a clear protocol with actions to perform for each level of each alert with an escalation policy

description: Learn how to temporarily pause staking activity in Polkadot using the chill extrinsic, with guidance for validators and nominators.

# Pause Validating

## Introduction

If you need to temporarily stop participating in Polkadot staking activities without fully unbonding your funds, chilling your account allows you to do so efficiently. Chilling removes your node from active validation or nomination in the next era while keeping your funds bonded, making it ideal for planned downtimes or temporary pauses.

This guide covers the steps for chilling as a validator or nominator, using the `chill` and `chillOther` extrinsics, and how these affect your staking status and nominations.

## Chilling Your Node

If you need to temporarily step back from staking without unbonding your funds, you can "chill" your account. Chilling pauses your active staking participation, setting your account to inactive in the next era while keeping your funds bonded.

To chill your account, go to the **Network > Staking > Account Actions** page on [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps){target=\_blank}, and select **Stop**. Alternatively, you can call the [`chill`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_staking/enum.Call.html#variant.chill){target=\_blank} extrinsic in the Staking pallet. 

## Staking Election Timing Considerations

When a node actively participates in staking but then chills, it will continue contributing for the remainder of the current era. However, its eligibility for the next election depends on the chill status at the start of the new era:

- **Chilled during previous era** - will not participate in the current era election and will remain inactive until reactivated
-**Chilled during current era** - will not be selected for the next era's election
-**Chilled after current era** - may be selected if it was active during the previous era and is now chilled

## Chilling as a Nominator

When you choose to chill as a nominator, your active nominations are reset. Upon re-entering the nominating process, you must reselect validators to support manually. Depending on preferences, these can be the same validators as before or a new set. Remember that your previous nominations won’t be saved or automatically reactivated after chilling.

While chilled, your nominator account remains bonded, preserving your staked funds without requiring a full unbonding process. When you’re ready to start nominating again, you can issue a new nomination call to activate your bond with a fresh set of validators. This process bypasses the need for re-bonding, allowing you to maintain your stake while adjusting your involvement in active staking.

## Chilling as a Validator

When you chill as a validator, your active validator status is paused. Although your nominators remain bonded to you, the validator bond will no longer appear as an active choice for new or revised nominations until reactivated. Any existing nominators who take no action will still have their stake linked to the validator, meaning they don’t need to reselect the validator upon reactivation. However, if nominators adjust their stakes while the validator is chilled, they will not be able to nominate the chilled validator until it resumes activity.

Upon reactivating as a validator, you must also reconfigure your validator preferences, such as commission rate and other parameters. These can be set to match your previous configuration or updated as desired. This step is essential for rejoining the active validator set and regaining eligibility for nominations.

## Chill Other

Historical constraints in the runtime prevented unlimited nominators and validators from being supported. These constraints created a need for checks to keep the size of the staking system manageable. One of these checks is the `chillOther` extrinsic, allowing users to chill accounts that no longer met standards such as minimum staking requirements set through on-chain governance.

This control mechanism included a `ChillThreshold`, which was structured to define how close to the maximum number of nominators or validators the staking system would be allowed to get before users could start chilling one another. With the passage of [Referendum #90](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/90){target=\_blank}, the value for `maxNominatorCount` on Polkadot was set to `None`, effectively removing the limit on how many nominators and validators can participate. This means the `ChillThreshold` will never be met; thus, `chillOther` no longer has any effect.

# Upgrade a Validator Node

## Introduction

Upgrading a Polkadot validator node is essential for staying current with network updates and maintaining optimal performance. This guide covers routine and extended maintenance scenarios, including software upgrades and major server changes. Following these steps, you can manage session keys and transition smoothly between servers without risking downtime, slashing, or network disruptions. The process requires strategic planning, especially if you need to perform long-lead maintenance, ensuring your validator remains active and compliant.

This guide will allow validators to seamlessly substitute an active validator server to allow for maintenance operations. The process can take several hours, so ensure you understand the instructions first and plan accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the upgrade process for your validator node, ensure the following:

- You have a fully functional validator setup with all required binaries installed. See [Set Up a Validator](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/){target=\_blank} and [Validator Requirements](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/requirements/){target=\_blank} for additional guidance
- Your VPS infrastructure has enough capacity to run a secondary validator instance temporarily for the upgrade process

## Session Keys

Session keys are used to sign validator operations and establish a connection between your validator node and your staking proxy account. These keys are stored in the client, and any change to them requires a waiting period. Specifically, if you modify your session keys, the change will take effect only after the current session is completed and two additional sessions have passed.

Remembering this delayed effect when planning upgrades is crucial to ensure that your validator continues to function correctly and avoids interruptions. To learn more about session keys and their importance, visit the [Keys section](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-cryptography#keys){target=\_blank}.

## Keystore

Your validator server's `keystore` folder holds the private keys needed for signing network-level transactions. It is important not to duplicate or transfer this folder between validator instances. Doing so could result in multiple validators signing with the duplicate keys, leading to severe consequences such as [equivocation slashing](/infrastructure/staking-mechanics/offenses-and-slashes/#equivocation-slash){target=\_blank}. Instead, always generate new session keys for each validator instance.

The default path to the `keystore` is as follows:

```bash
/home/polkadot/.local/share/polkadot/chains/<chain>/keystore
```

Taking care to manage your keys securely ensures that your validator operates safely and without the risk of slashing penalties.

## Upgrade Using Backup Validator

The following instructions outline how to temporarily switch between two validator nodes. The original active validator is referred to as Validator A and the backup node used for maintenance purposes as Validator B.

### Session `N`

1. **Start Validator B** - launch a secondary node and wait until it is fully synced with the network. Once synced, start it with the `--validator` flag. This node will now act as Validator B
2. **Generate session keys** - create new session keys specifically for Validator B
3. **Submit the `set_key` extrinsic** - use your staking proxy account to submit a `set_key` extrinsic, linking the session keys for Validator B to your staking setup
4. **Record the session** - make a note of the session in which you executed this extrinsic
5. **Wait for session changes** - allow the current session to end and then wait for two additional full sessions for the new keys to take effect

!!! warning "Keep Validator A running"

      It is crucial to keep Validator A operational during this entire waiting period. Since `set_key` does not take effect immediately, turning off Validator A too early may result in chilling or even slashing.

### Session `N+3`

At this stage, Validator B becomes your active validator. You can now safely perform any maintenance tasks on Validator A.

Complete the following steps when you are ready to bring Validator A back online:

1. **Start Validator A** - launch Validator A, sync the blockchain database, and ensure it is running with the `--validator` flag
2. **Generate new session keys for Validator A** - create fresh session keys for Validator A
3. **Submit the `set_key` extrinsic** - using your staking proxy account, submit a `set_key` extrinsic with the new Validator A session keys
4. **Record the session** - again, make a note of the session in which you executed this extrinsic

Keep Validator B active until the session during which you executed the `set-key` extrinsic completes plus two additional full sessions have passed. Once Validator A has successfully taken over, you can safely stop Validator B. This process helps ensure a smooth handoff between nodes and minimizes the risk of downtime or penalties. Verify the transition by checking for finalized blocks in the new session. The logs should indicate the successful change, similar to the example below:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>INSERT_COMMAND</span>
  <span data-ty>2019-10-28 21:44:13 Applying authority set change scheduled at block #450092</span>
  <span data-ty>2019-10-28 21:44:13 Applying GRANDPA set change to new set with 20 authorities</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

# Validator Requirements

## Introduction

Running a validator in the Polkadot ecosystem is essential for maintaining network security and decentralization. Validators are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the chain, ensuring the system operates smoothly. In return for their services, validators earn rewards. However, the role comes with inherent risks, such as slashing penalties for misbehavior or technical failures. If you’re new to validation, starting on Kusama provides a lower-stakes environment to gain valuable experience before progressing to the Polkadot network.

This guide covers everything you need to know about becoming a validator, including system requirements, staking prerequisites, and infrastructure setup. Whether you’re deploying on a VPS or running your node on custom hardware, you’ll learn how to optimize your validator for performance and security, ensuring compliance with network standards while minimizing risks.

## Prerequisites

Running a validator requires solid system administration skills and a secure, well-maintained infrastructure. Below are the primary requirements you need to be aware of before getting started:

- **System administration expertise** - handling technical anomalies and maintaining node infrastructure is critical. Validators must be able to troubleshoot and optimize their setup
- **Security** - ensure your setup follows best practices for securing your node. Refer to the [Secure Your Validator](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/general-management/#secure-your-validator){target=\_blank} section to learn about important security measures
- **Network choice** - start with [Kusama](/infrastructure/running-a-validator/onboarding-and-offboarding/set-up-validator/#run-a-kusama-validator){target=\_blank} to gain experience. Look for "Adjustments for Kusama" throughout these guides for tips on adapting the provided instructions for the Kusama network
- **Staking requirements** - a minimum amount of native token (KSM or DOT) is required to be elected into the validator set. The required stake can come from your own holdings or from nominators
- **Risk of slashing** - any DOT you stake is at risk if your setup fails or your validator misbehaves. If you’re unsure of your ability to maintain a reliable validator, consider nominating your DOT to a trusted validator

## Minimum Hardware Requirements

Polkadot validators rely on high-performance hardware to process blocks efficiently. The recommended minimum hardware requirements to ensure a fully functional and performant validator are as follows:

- **CPU**:

    - x86-64 compatible
    - Eight physical cores @ 3.4 GHz
        - Per [Referenda #1051](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1051){target=\_blank}, this will be a hard requirement as of January 2025
    - Processor:
        - Intel - Ice Lake or newer (Xeon or Core series)
        - AMD - Zen3 or newer (EPYC or Ryzen)
    - Simultaneous multithreading disabled:
        - Intel - Hyper-Threading
        - AMD - SMT
    - [Single-threaded performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html){target=\_blank} is prioritized over higher cores count

- **Storage**:

    - NVMe SSD - at least 1 TB for blockchain data (prioritize latency rather than throughput)
    - Storage requirements will increase as the chain grows. For current estimates, see the [current chain snapshot](https://stakeworld.io/docs/dbsize){target=\_blank}

- **Memory**:

    - 32 GB DDR4 ECC

- **Network**:

    - Symmetric networking speed of 500 Mbit/s is required to handle large numbers of parachains and ensure congestion control during peak times

## VPS Provider List

When selecting a VPS provider for your validator node, prioritize reliability, consistent performance, and adherence to the specific hardware requirements set for Polkadot validators. The following server types have been tested and showed acceptable performance in benchmark tests. However, this is not an endorsement and actual performance may vary depending on your workload and VPS provider.

- [**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**](https://cloud.google.com/){target=\_blank} - `c2` and `c2d` machine families offer high-performance configurations suitable for validators
- [**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**](https://aws.amazon.com/){target=\_blank} - `c6id` machine family provides strong performance, particularly for I/O-intensive workloads
- [**OVH**](https://www.ovh.com.au/){target=\_blank} - can be a budget-friendly solution if it meets your minimum hardware specifications
- [**Digital Ocean**](https://www.digitalocean.com/){target=\_blank} - popular among developers, Digital Ocean's premium droplets offer configurations suitable for medium to high-intensity workloads
- [**Vultr**](https://www.vultr.com/){target=\_blank} - offers flexibility with plans that may meet validator requirements, especially for high-bandwidth needs
- [**Linode**](https://www.linode.com/){target=\_blank} - provides detailed documentation, which can be helpful for setup
- [**Scaleway**](https://www.scaleway.com/){target=\_blank} - offers high-performance cloud instances that can be suitable for validator nodes
- [**OnFinality**](https://onfinality.io/){target=\_blank} - specialized in blockchain infrastructure, OnFinality provides validator-specific support and configurations

!!! warning "Acceptable use policies"
    Different VPS providers have varying acceptable use policies, and not all allow cryptocurrency-related activities. 

    For example, Digital Ocean, requires explicit permission to use servers for cryptocurrency mining and defines unauthorized mining as [network abuse](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy#network-abuse){target=\_blank} in their acceptable use policy. 
    
    Review the terms for your VPS provider to avoid account suspension or server shutdown due to policy violations.

## Minimum Bond Requirement

Before bonding DOT, ensure you meet the minimum bond requirement to start a validator instance. The minimum bond is the least DOT you need to stake to enter the validator set. To become eligible for rewards, your validator node must be nominated by enough staked tokens.

For example, on November 19, 2024, the minimum stake backing a validator in Polkadot's era 1632 was 1,159,434.248 DOT. You can check the current minimum stake required using these tools:

# Offenses and Slashes

## Introduction

In Polkadot's Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) system, validator misconduct is deterred through a combination of slashing, disabling, and reputation penalties. Validators and nominators who stake tokens face consequences for validator misbehavior, which range from token slashes to restrictions on network participation.

This page outlines the types of offenses recognized by Polkadot, including block equivocations and invalid votes, as well as the corresponding penalties. While some parachains may implement additional custom slashing mechanisms, this guide focuses on the offenses tied to staking within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Offenses

Polkadot is a public permissionless network. As such, it has a mechanism to disincentivize offenses and incentivize good behavior. You can review the [parachain protocol](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains-protocol#parachain-protocol){target=\_blank} to understand better the terminology used to describe offenses. Polkadot validator offenses fall into two categories: invalid votes and equivocations. 

### Invalid Votes

A validator will be penalized for inappropriate voting activity during the block inclusion and approval processes. The invalid voting related offenses are as follows:

- **Backing an invalid block** - a para-validator backs an invalid block for inclusion in a fork of the relay chain
- **`ForInvalid` vote** - when acting as a secondary checker, the validator votes in favor of an invalid block
- **`AgainstValid` vote** - when acting as a secondary checker, the validator votes against a valid block. This type of vote wastes network resources required to resolve the disparate votes and resulting dispute

### Equivocations

Equivocation occurs when a validator produces statements that conflict with each other when producing blocks or voting. Unintentional equivocations usually occur when duplicate signing keys reside on the validator host. If keys are never duplicated, the probability of an honest equivocation slash decreases to near zero. The equivocation related offenses are as follows:

- **Equivocation** - the validator produces two or more of the same block or vote
    - **GRANDPA and BEEFY equivocation** - the validator signs two or more votes in the same round on different chains
    - **BABE equivocation** - the validator produces two or more blocks on the relay chain in the same time slot
- **Double seconded equivocation** - the validator attempts to second, or back, more than one block in the same round
- **Seconded and valid equivocation** - the validator seconds, or backs, a block and then attempts to hide their role as the responsible backer by later placing a standard validation vote

## Penalties

On Polkadot, offenses to the network incur different penalties depending on severity. There are three main penalties: slashing, disabling, and reputation changes.

### Slashing

Validators engaging in bad actor behavior in the network may be subject to slashing if they commit a qualifying offense. When a validator is slashed, they and their nominators lose a percentage of their staked DOT or KSM, from as little as 0.01% up to 100% based on the severity of the offense. Nominators are evaluated for slashing against their active validations at any given time. Validator nodes are evaluated as discrete entities, meaning an operator can't attempt to mitigate the offense on another node they operate in order to avoid a slash. 

Any slashed DOT or KSM will be added to the [Treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury){target=\_blank} rather than burned or distributed as rewards. Moving slashed funds to the Treasury allows tokens to be quickly moved away from malicious validators while maintaining the ability to revert faulty slashes when needed.

A nominator with a very large bond may nominate several validators in a single era. In this case, a slash is proportionate to the amount staked to the offending validator. Stake allocation and validator activation is controlled by the [Phragmén algorithm](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen#understanding-phragm%C3%A9n){target=\_blank}.

A validator slash creates an `unapplied` state transition. You can view pending slashes on [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/staking/slashes){target=\_blank}. The UI will display the slash per validator, the affected nominators, and the slash amounts. The unapplied state includes a 27-day grace period during which a governance proposal can be made to reverse the slash. Once this grace period expires, the slash is applied.

#### Equivocation Slash

The Web3 Foundation's [Slashing mechanisms](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/slashing/amounts){target=\_blank} page provides guidelines for evaluating the security threat level of different offenses and determining penalties proportionate to the threat level of the offense. Offenses requiring coordination between validators or extensive computational costs to the system will typically call for harsher penalties than those more likely to be unintentional than malicious. A description of potential offenses for each threat level and the corresponding penalties is as follows:

- **Level 1** - honest misconduct such as isolated cases of unresponsiveness
    - **Penalty** - validator can be kicked out or slashed up to 0.1% of stake in the validator slot
- **Level 2** - misconduct that can occur honestly but is a sign of bad practices. Examples include repeated cases of unresponsiveness and isolated cases of equivocation
    - **Penalty** - slash of up to 1% of stake in the validator slot
- **Level 3** - misconduct that is likely intentional but of limited effect on the performance or security of the network. This level will typically include signs of coordination between validators. Examples include repeated cases of equivocation or isolated cases of unjustified voting on GRANDPA
    - **Penalty** - reduction in networking reputation metrics, slash of up to 10% of stake in the validator slot
- **Level 4** - misconduct that poses severe security or monetary risk to the system or mass collusion. Examples include signs of extensive coordination, creating a serious security risk to the system, or forcing the system to use extensive resources to counter the misconduct
    - **Penalty** - slash of up to 100% of stake in the validator slot

See the next section to understand how slash amounts for equivocations are calculated. If you want to know more details about slashing, please look at the research page on [Slashing mechanisms](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/slashing/amounts){target=\_blank}.

#### Slash Calculation for Equivocation

The slashing penalty for GRANDPA, BABE, and BEEFY equivocations is calculated using the formula below, where `x` represents the number of offenders and `n` is the total number of validators in the active set:

```text
min((3 * x / n )^2, 1)
```

The following scenarios demonstrate how this formula means slash percentages can increase exponentially based on the number of offenders involved compared to the size of the validator pool:

- **Minor offense** - assume 1 validator out of a 100 validator active set equivocates in a slot. A single validator committing an isolated offense is most likely a mistake rather than malicious attack on the network. This offense results in a 0.09% slash to the stake in the validator slot

    ``` mermaid
    flowchart LR
    N["Total Validators = 100"]
    X["Offenders = 1"]
    F["min(3 * 1 / 100)^2, 1) = 0.0009"]
    G["0.09% slash of stake"]

    N --> F
    X --> F
    F --> G
    ```

- **Moderate offense** - assume 5 validators out a 100 validator active set equivocate in a slot. This is a slightly more serious event as there may be some element of coordination involved. This offense results in a 2.25% slash to the stake in the validator slot

    ``` mermaid
    flowchart LR
    N["Total Validators = 100"]
    X["Offenders = 5"]
    F["min((3 * 5 / 100)^2, 1) = 0.0225"]
    G["2.25% slash of stake"]

    N --> F
    X --> F
    F --> G
    ```

- **Major offense** - assume 20 validators out a 100 validator active set equivocate in a slot. This is a major security threat as it possible represents a coordinated attack on the network. This offense results in a 36% slash and all slashed validators will also be chilled
    ``` mermaid
    flowchart LR
    N["Total Validators = 100"]
    X["Offenders = 20"]
    F["min((3 * 20 / 100)^2, 1) = 0.36"]
    G["36% slash of stake"]

    N --> F
    X --> F
    F --> G
    ```

The examples above show the risk of nominating or running many validators in the active set. While rewards grow linearly (two validators will get you approximately twice as many staking rewards as one), slashing grows exponentially. Going from a single validator equivocating to two validators equivocating causes a slash four time as much as the single validator.

Validators may run their nodes on multiple machines to ensure they can still perform validation work if one of their nodes goes down. Still, validator operators should be cautious when setting these up. Equivocation is possible if they don't coordinate well in managing signing machines.

#### Best Practices to Avoid Slashing

The following are advised to node operators to ensure that they obtain pristine binaries or source code and to ensure the security of their node:

- Always download either source files or binaries from the official Parity repository
- Verify the hash of downloaded files
- Use the W3F secure validator setup or adhere to its principles
- Ensure essential security items are checked, use a firewall, manage user access, use SSH certificates
- Avoid using your server as a general-purpose system. Hosting a validator on your workstation or one that hosts other services increases the risk of maleficence
- Avoid cloning servers (copying all contents) when migrating to new hardware. If an image is needed, create it before generating keys
- High Availability (HA) systems are generally not recommended as equivocation may occur if concurrent operations happen—such as when a failed server restarts or two servers are falsely online simultaneously
- Copying the keystore folder when moving a database between instances can cause equivocation. Even brief use of duplicated keystores can result in slashing

Below are some examples of small equivocations that happened in the past:

| Network  | Era  | Event Type         | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Action Taken                                                                                                                      |

| Kusama   | 3995 | Small Equivocation | The validator noticed several errors, after which the client crashed, and a slash was applied.

The council approved the request as they believed the error wasn't operator-related. |

#### Slashing Across Eras

There are three main difficulties to account for with slashing in NPoS:

- A nominator can nominate multiple validators and be slashed as a result of actions taken by any of them
- Until slashed, the stake is reused from era to era
- Slashable offenses can be found after the fact and out of order

To balance this, the system applies only the maximum slash a participant can receive in a given time period rather than the sum. This ensures protection from excessive slashing.

### Disabling

The disabling mechanism is triggered when validators commit serious infractions, such as backing invalid blocks or engaging in equivocations. Disabling stops validators from performing specific actions after they have committed an offense. Disabling is further divided into:

- **On-chain disabling** - lasts for a whole era and stops validators from authoring blocks, backing, and initiating a dispute
- **Off-chain disabling** - lasts for a session, is caused by losing a dispute, and stops validators from initiating a dispute

Off-chain disabling is always a lower priority than on-chain disabling. Off-chain disabling prioritizes disabling first backers and then approval checkers.

The material in this guide reflects the changes introduced in Stage 2. For more details, see the [State of Disabling issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/4359){target=\_blank} on GitHub.


### Reputation Changes

Some minor offenses, such as spamming, are only punished by networking reputation changes. Validators use a reputation metric when choosing which peers to connect with. The system adds reputation if a peer provides valuable data and behaves appropriately. If they provide faulty or spam data, the system reduces their reputation. If a validator loses enough reputation, their peers will temporarily close their channels to them. This helps in fighting against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performing validator tasks under reduced reputation will be harder, resulting in lower validator rewards.

### Penalties by Offense

Below, you can find a summary of penalties for specific offenses:

|               Offense                | [Slash (%)](#slashing) | [On-Chain Disabling](#disabling) | [Off-Chain Disabling](#disabling) | [Reputational Changes](#reputation-changes) |

# Rewards Payout

## Introduction

Understanding how rewards are distributed to validators and nominators is essential for network participants. In Polkadot and Kusama, validators earn rewards based on their era points, which are accrued through actions like block production and parachain validation.

This guide explains the payout scheme, factors influencing rewards, and how multiple validators affect returns. Validators can also share rewards with nominators, who contribute by staking behind them. By following the payout mechanics, validators can optimize their earnings and better engage with their nominators.

## Era Points

The Polkadot ecosystem measures its reward cycles in a unit called an era. Kusama eras are approximately 6 hours long, and Polkadot eras are 24 hours long. At the end of each era, validators are paid proportionally to the amount of [era points](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout#era-points){target=\_blank} they have collected. Era points are reward points earned for payable actions like:

- Issuing validity statements for [parachain blocks](/polkadot-protocol/basics/blocks-transactions-fees/blocks/){target=\_blank}
- Producing a non-uncle block in the relay chain
- Producing a reference to a previously unreferenced uncle block
- Producing a referenced uncle block

An uncle block is a relay chain block that is valid in every regard but has failed to become canonical. This can happen when two or more validators are block producers in a single slot, and the block produced by one validator reaches the next block producer before the others. The lagging blocks are called uncle blocks.

## Reward Variance

Rewards in Polkadot and Kusama staking systems can fluctuate due to differences in era points earned by para-validators and non-para-validators. Para-validators generally contribute more to the overall reward distribution due to their role in validating parachain blocks, thus influencing the variance in staking rewards.

To illustrate this relationship:

- Para-validator era points tend to have a higher impact on the expected value of staking rewards compared to non-para-validator points
- The variance in staking rewards increases as the total number of validators grows relative to the number of para-validators
- In simpler terms, when more validators are added to the active set without increasing the para-validator pool, the disparity in rewards between validators becomes more pronounced

However, despite this increased variance, rewards tend to even out over time due to the continuous rotation of para-validators across eras. The network's design ensures that over multiple eras, each validator has an equal opportunity to participate in para-validation, eventually leading to a balanced distribution of rewards.

??? interface "Probability in Staking Rewards"

    This should only serve as a high-level overview of the probabilistic nature for staking rewards.

    Let:

    - `pe` = para-validator era points
    - `ne` = non-para-validator era points
    - `EV` = expected value of staking rewards

    Then, `EV(pe)` has more influence on the `EV` than `EV(ne)`.

    Since `EV(pe)` has a more weighted probability on the `EV`, the increase in variance against the `EV` becomes apparent between the different validator pools (aka. validators in the active set and the ones chosen to para-validate).

    Also, let:

    - `v` = the variance of staking rewards
    - `p` = number of para-validators
    - `w` = number validators in the active set
    - `e` = era

    Then, `v` &#8593; if `w` &#8593;, as this reduces `p` : `w`, with respect to `e`.

    Increased `v` is expected, and initially keeping `p` &#8595; using the same para-validator set for all parachains ensures [availability](https://spec.polkadot.network/chapter-anv){target=\_blank} and [voting](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov){target=\_blank}. In addition, despite `v` &#8593; on an `e` to `e` basis, over time, the amount of rewards each validator receives will equal out based on the continuous selection of para-validators.

    There are plans to scale the active para-validation set in the future.

## Payout Scheme

Validator rewards are distributed equally among all validators in the active set, regardless of the total stake behind each validator. However, individual payouts may differ based on the number of era points a validator has earned. Although factors like network connectivity can affect era points, well-performing validators should accumulate similar totals over time.

Validators can also receive tips from users, which incentivize them to include certain transactions in their blocks. Validators retain 100% of these tips.

Rewards are paid out in the network's native token (DOT for Polkadot and KSM for Kusama). 

The following example illustrates a four member validator set with their names, amount they have staked, and how payout of rewards is divided. This scenario assumes all validators earned the same amount of era points and no one received tips: 

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Alice (18 DOT)"]
    B["Bob (9 DOT)"]
    C["Carol (8 DOT)"]
    D["Dave (7 DOT)"]
    E["Payout (8 DOT total)"]
    E --"2 DOT"--> A
    E --"2 DOT"--> B
    E --"2 DOT"--> C
    E --"2 DOT"--> D
```

Note that this is different than most other Proof of Stake (PoS) systems. As long as a validator is in the validator set, it will receive the same block reward as every other validator. Validator Alice, who had 18 DOT staked, received the same 2 DOT reward in this era as Dave, who had only 7 DOT staked.

## Running Multiple Validators

Running multiple validators can offer a more favorable risk/reward ratio compared to running a single one. If you have sufficient DOT or nominators staking on your validators, maintaining multiple validators within the active set can yield higher rewards.

In the preceding section, with 18 DOT staked and no nominators, Alice earned 2 DOT in one era. This example uses DOT, but the same principles apply for KSM on the Kusama network. By managing stake across multiple validators, you can potentially increase overall returns. Recall the set of validators from the preceding section:

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Alice (18 DOT)"]
    B["Bob (9 DOT)"]
    C["Carol (8 DOT)"]
    D["Dave (7 DOT)"]
    E["Payout (8 DOT total)"]
    E --"2 DOT"--> A
    E --"2 DOT"--> B
    E --"2 DOT"--> C
    E --"2 DOT"--> D 
```

Now, assume Alice decides to split their stake and run two validators, each with a nine DOT stake. This validator set only has four spots and priority is given to validators with a larger stake. In this example, Dave has the smallest stake and loses his spot in the validator set. Now, Alice will earn two shares of the total payout each era as illustrated below:

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Alice (9 DOT)"]
    F["Alice (9 DOT)"]
    B["Bob (9 DOT)"]
    C["Carol (8 DOT)"]
    E["Payout (8 DOT total)"]
    E --"2 DOT"--> A
    E --"2 DOT"--> B
    E --"2 DOT"--> C
    E --"2 DOT"--> F 
```

With enough stake, you could run more than two validators. However, each validator must have enough stake behind it to maintain a spot in the validator set.

## Nominators and Validator Payments

A nominator's stake allows them to vote for validators and earn a share of the rewards without managing a validator node. Although staking rewards depend on validator activity during an era, validators themselves never control or own nominator rewards. To trigger payouts, anyone can call the `staking.payoutStakers` or `staking.payoutStakerByPage` methods, which mint and distribute rewards directly to the recipients. This trustless process ensures nominators receive their earned rewards.

Validators set a commission rate as a percentage of the block reward, affecting how rewards are shared with nominators. A 0% commission means the validator keeps only rewards from their self-stake, while a 100% commission means they retain all rewards, leaving none for nominators.

The following examples model splitting validator payments between nominator and validator using various commission percentages. For simplicity, these examples assume a Polkadot-SDK based relay chain that uses DOT as a native token and a single nominator per validator. Calculations of KSM reward payouts for Kusama follow the same formula. 

Start with the original validator set from the previous section: 

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Alice (18 DOT)"]
    B["Bob (9 DOT)"]
    C["Carol (8 DOT)"]
    D["Dave (7 DOT)"]
    E["Payout (8 DOT total)"]
    E --"2 DOT"--> A
    E --"2 DOT"--> B
    E --"2 DOT"--> C
    E --"2 DOT"--> D 
```

The preceding diagram shows each validator receiving a 2 DOT payout, but doesn't account for sharing rewards with nominators. The following diagram shows what nominator payout might look like for validator Alice. Alice has a 20% commission rate and holds 50% of the stake for their validator:

``` mermaid

flowchart TD
    A["Gross Rewards = 2 DOT"]
    E["Commission = 20%"]
    F["Alice Validator Payment = 0.4 DOT"]
    G["Total Stake Rewards = 1.6 DOT"]
    B["Alice Validator Stake = 18 DOT"]
    C["9 DOT Alice (50%)"]
    H["Alice Stake Reward = 0.8 DOT"]
    I["Total Alice Validator Reward = 1.2 DOT"]
    D["9 DOT Nominator (50%)"]
    J["Total Nominator Reward = 0.8 DOT"]
    
    A --> E
    E --(2 x 0.20)--> F
    F --(2 - 0.4)--> G
    B --> C
    B --> D
    C --(1.6 x 0.50)--> H
    H --(0.4 + 0.8)--> I
    D --(1.60 x 0.50)--> J
```

Notice the validator commission rate is applied against the gross amount of rewards for the era. The validator commission is subtracted from the total rewards. After the commission is paid to the validator, the remaining amount is split among stake owners according to their percentage of the total stake. A validator's total rewards for an era include their commission plus their piece of the stake rewards. 

Now, consider a different scenario for validator Bob where the commission rate is 40%, and Bob holds 33% of the stake for their validator:

``` mermaid

flowchart TD
    A["Gross Rewards = 2 DOT"]
    E["Commission = 40%"]
    F["Bob Validator Payment = 0.8 DOT"]
    G["Total Stake Rewards = 1.2 DOT"]
    B["Bob Validator Stake = 9 DOT"]
    C["3 DOT Bob (33%)"]
    H["Bob Stake Reward = 0.4 DOT"]
    I["Total Bob Validator Reward = 1.2 DOT"]
    D["6 DOT Nominator (67%)"]
    J["Total Nominator Reward = 0.8 DOT"]
    
    A --> E
    E --(2 x 0.4)--> F
    F --(2 - 0.8)--> G
    B --> C
    B --> D
    C --(1.2 x 0.33)--> H
    H --(0.8 + 0.4)--> I
    D --(1.2 x 0.67)--> J
```

Bob holds a smaller percentage of their node's total stake, making their stake reward smaller than Alice's. In this scenario, Bob makes up the difference by charging a 40% commission rate and ultimately ends up with the same total payment as Alice. Each validator will need to find their ideal balance between the amount of stake and commission rate to attract nominators while still making running a validator worthwhile.

Explore Polkadot's architecture, including the relay chain, parachains, and system chains, and discover the role each component plays in the broader ecosystem.

## A Brief Look at Polkadot’s Chain Ecosystem

The following provides a brief overview of the role of each chain:

- [**Polkadot chain**](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/) - the central hub and main chain responsible for the overall security, consensus, and interoperability between all connected chains

- [**System chains**](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/) - specialized chains that provide essential services to the ecosystem, like the Asset Hub, Bridge Hub, and Coretime chain

- [**Parachains**](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/parachains/) -  individual, specialized blockchains that run parallel to the relay chain and are connected to it

# Parachain Consensus

## Introduction

Parachains are independent blockchains built with the Polkadot SDK, designed to leverage Polkadot’s relay chain for shared security and transaction finality. These specialized chains operate as part of Polkadot’s execution sharding model, where each parachain manages its own state and transactions while relying on the relay chain for validation and consensus.

At the core of parachain functionality are collators, specialized nodes that sequence transactions into blocks and maintain the parachain’s state. Collators optimize Polkadot’s architecture by offloading state management from the relay chain, allowing relay chain validators to focus solely on validating parachain blocks.

This guide explores how parachain consensus works, including the roles of collators and validators, and the steps involved in securing parachain blocks within Polkadot’s scalable and decentralized framework.

## The Role of Collators

Collators are responsible for sequencing end-user transactions into blocks and maintaining the current state of their respective parachains. Their role is akin to Ethereum’s sequencers but optimized for Polkadot's architecture.

Key responsibilities include:

- **Transaction sequencing** - organizing transactions into [Proof of Validity (PoV)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/glossary#proof-of-validity){target=\_blank} blocks
- **State management** - maintaining parachain states without burdening the relay chain validators
- **Consensus participation** - sending PoV blocks to relay chain validators for approval

## Consensus and Validation

Parachain consensus operates in tandem with the relay chain, leveraging Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) for shared security. The process ensures parachain transactions achieve finality through the following steps:

1. **Packaging transactions** - collators bundle transactions into PoV blocks (parablocks)
2. **Submission to validator** - parablocks are submitted to a randomly selected subset of relay chain validators, known as paravalidators
3. **Validation of PoV Blocks** - paravalidators use the parachain’s state transition function (already available on the relay chain) to verify transaction validity
4. **Backing and inclusion** - if a sufficient number of positive validations are received, the parablock is backed and included via a para-header on the relay chain

The following sections describe the actions taking place during each stage of the process. 

### Path of a Parachain Block

Polkadot achieves scalability through execution sharding, where each parachain operates as an independent shard with its own blockchain and state. Shared security for all parachains is provided by the relay chain, powered by [Nominated Proof of Staking (NPoS)](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos){target=\_blank}. This framework allows parachains to focus on transaction processing and state management, while the relay chain ensures validation and finality.

The journey parachain transactions follow to reach consensus and finality can be described as follows:

- **Collators and parablocks:**

    - Collators, specialized nodes on parachains, package network transactions into Proof of Validity (PoV) blocks, also called parablocks
    - These parablocks are sent to a subset of relay chain validators, known as paravalidators, for validation
    - The parachain's state transition function (Wasm blob) is not re-sent, as it is already stored on the relay chain

```mermaid

    end

    subgraph Relay["Relay Chain"]
        ParaValidator
    end

    %% Main Flow
    Parachain -->|Submit To| Relay
```

- **Validation by paravalidators:**

    - Paravalidators are groups of approximately five relay chain validators, randomly assigned to parachains and shuffled every minute
    - Each paravalidator downloads the parachain's Wasm blob and validates the parablock by ensuring all transactions comply with the parachain’s state transition rules
    - Paravalidators sign positive or negative validation statements based on the block’s validity

- **Backing and approval:**

    - If a parablock receives sufficient positive validation statements, it is backed and included on the relay chain as a para-header
    - An additional approval process resolves disputes. If a parablock contains invalid transactions, additional validators are tasked with verification
    - Validators who back invalid parablocks are penalized through slashing, creating strong incentives for honest behavior

    %% Dispute Flow
    Approval -->|If Invalid\nDetected| Dispute
    Dispute -->|Penalize\nDishonest\nValidators| Slashing
```

It is important to understand that relay chain blocks do not store full parachain blocks (parablocks). Instead, they include para-headers, which serve as summaries of the backed parablocks. The complete parablock remains within the parachain network, maintaining its autonomy while relying on the relay chain for validation and finality.

## Introduction 

A [_parachain_](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#parachain){target=\_blank} is a coherent, application-specific blockchain that derives security from its respective relay chain. Parachains on Polkadot are each their own separate, fully functioning blockchain. The primary difference between a parachain and a regular, "solo" blockchain is that the relay chain verifies the state of all parachains that are connected to it.  In many ways, parachains can be thought of as a ["cynical" rollup](#cryptoeconomic-security-elves-protocol), as the crypto-economic protocol used (ELVES) assumes the worst-case scenario, rather than the typical optimistic approach that many roll-up mechanisms take. Once enough validators attest that a block is valid, then the probability of that block being valid is high.

As each parachain’s state is validated by the relay chain, the relay chain represents the collective state of all parachains.

## Coherent Systems
    
Coherency refers to the degree of synchronization, consistency, and interoperability between different components or chains within a system. It encompasses the internal coherence of individual chains and the external coherence between chains regarding how they interact.
    
A single-state machine like Ethereum is very coherent, as all of its components (smart contracts, dApps/applications, staking, consensus) operate within a single environment with the downside of less scalability. Multi-protocol state machines, such as Polkadot, offer less coherency due to their sharded nature but more scalability due to the parallelization of their architecture.

Parachains are coherent, as they are self-contained environments with domain-specific functionality.

## Flexible Ecosystem

Parachains enable parallelization of different services within the same network. However, unlike most layer two rollups, parachains don't suffer the same interoperability pitfalls that most rollups suffer. [Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank} provides a common communication format for each parachain and can be configured to allow a parachain to communicate with just the relay chain or certain parachains. 

The diagram below highlights the flexibility of the Polkadot ecosystem, where each parachain specializes in a distinct domain. This example illustrates how parachains, like DeFi and GameFi, leverage XCM for cross-chain operations such as asset transfers and credential verification.

    RC -->|Validate & Route XCM| NFT
    RC -->|Validate & Route XCM| Identity

    note["XCM Features:\n- Standardized Messaging\n- Cross-Chain Interactions\n- Secure Asset/Data Transfer"]
```

Most parachains are built using the Polkadot SDK, which provides all the tools to create a fully functioning parachain. However, it is possible to construct a parachain that can inherit the security of the relay chain as long as it implements the correct mechanisms expected by the relay chain.

## State Transition Functions (Runtimes)

Determinism is a fundamental property where given the same input, a system will consistently produce identical outputs. In blockchain systems, this predictable behavior is essential for state machines, which are algorithms that transition between different states based on specific inputs to generate a new state.

At their core, parachains, like most blockchains, are deterministic, finite-state machines that are often backed by game theory and economics. The previous state of the parachain, combined with external input in the form of [extrinsics](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#extrinsic){target=\_blank}, allows the state machine to progress forward, one block at a time.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> StateA : Initial State
    
    StateA --> STF : Extrinsics/Transactions
    STF --> StateB : Deterministic Transformation
    StateB --> [*] : New State
```

The primary driver of this progression is the state transition function (STF), commonly referred to as a runtime. Each time a block is submitted, it represents the next proposed state for a parachain. By applying the state transition function to the previous state and including a new block that contains the proposed changes in the form of a list of extrinsics/transactions, the runtime defines just exactly how the parachain is to advance from state A to state B.

The STF in a Polkadot SDK-based chain is compiled to Wasm and uploaded on the relay chain. This STF is crucial for the relay chain to validate the state changes coming from the parachain, as it is used to ensure that all proposed state transitions are happening correctly as part of the validation process.

For more information on the Wasm meta protocol that powers runtimes, see the [WASM Meta Protocol](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/wasm_meta_protocol/index.html){target=\blank} in the Polkadot SDK Rust Docs.

## Shared Security: Validated by the Relay Chain

The relay chain provides a layer of economic security for its parachains. Parachains submit proof of validation (PoV) data to the relay chain for validation through [collators](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#collator), upon which the relay chains' validators ensure the validity of this data in accordance with the STF for that particular parachain. In other words, the consensus for a parachain follows the relay chain. While parachains choose how a block is authored, what it contains, and who authors it, the relay chain ultimately provides finality and consensus for those blocks.

For more information about the parachain and relay chain validation process, see the [Parachains' Protocol Overview: Protocols' Summary](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains-protocol#protocols-summary){target=\blank} entry in the Polkadot Wiki.

Parachains need at least one honest collator to submit PoV data to the relay chain. Without this, the parachain can't progress. The mechanisms that facilitate this are found in the Cumulus portion of the Polkadot SDK, some of which are found in the [`cumulus_pallet_parachain_system`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/cumulus_pallet_parachain_system/index.html){target=\blank}

### Cryptoeconomic Security: ELVES Protocol

The [ELVES (Economic Last Validation Enforcement System)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/961){target=\_blank} protocol forms the foundation of Polkadot's cryptoeconomic security model. ELVES assumes a worst-case scenario by enforcing strict validation rules before any state transitions are finalized. Unlike optimistic approaches that rely on post-facto dispute resolution, ELVES ensures that validators collectively confirm the validity of a block before it becomes part of the parachain's state.

Validators are incentivized through staking and penalized for malicious or erroneous actions, ensuring adherence to the protocol. This approach minimizes the probability of invalid states being propagated across the network, providing robust security for parachains.

## Interoperability

Polkadot's interoperability framework allows parachains to communicate with each other, fostering a diverse ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. Through [Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=_blank}, parachains can transfer assets, share data, and invoke functionalities on other chains securely. This standardized messaging protocol ensures that parachains can interact with the relay chain and each other, supporting efficient cross-chain operations.

The XCM protocol mitigates common interoperability challenges in isolated blockchain networks, such as fragmented ecosystems and limited collaboration. By enabling decentralized applications to leverage resources and functionality across parachains, Polkadot promotes a scalable, cooperative blockchain environment that benefits all participants.

# Agile Coretime

## Introduction

Agile Coretime is the [scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)){target=\_blank} framework on Polkadot that lets parachains efficiently access cores, which comprise an active validator set tasked with parablock validation. As the first blockchain to enable a flexible scheduling system for blockspace production, Polkadot offers unparalleled adaptability for parachains.

``` mermaid
graph TB
    A[Cores Designation]
    B[Bulk Coretime]
    C[On-Demand Coretime]
    A --continuous--> B
    A --flexible--> C 
```

Cores can be designated to a parachain either continuously through [bulk coretime](#bulk-coretime) or dynamically via [on-demand coretime](#on-demand-coretime). Additionally, Polkadot supports scheduling multiple cores in parallel through [elastic scaling](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-elastic-scaling){target=\_blank}, which is a feature under active development on Polkadot. This flexibility empowers parachains to optimize their resource usage and block production according to their unique needs.

In this guide, you'll learn how bulk coretime enables continuous core access with features like interlacing and splitting, and how on-demand coretime provides flexible, pay-per-use scheduling for parachains. For a deep dive on Agile Coretime and its terminology, refer to the [Wiki doc](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-agile-coretime#introduction-to-agile-coretime){target=\_blank}.

## Bulk Coretime

Bulk coretime is a fixed duration of continuous coretime represented by an NFT that can be purchased through [coretime sales](#coretime-sales) in DOT and can be split, shared, or resold. Currently, the duration of bulk coretime is set to 28 days. Coretime purchased in bulk and assigned to a single parachain is eligible for a price-capped renewal, providing a form of rent-controlled access, which is important for predicting the running costs in the near future. Suppose the bulk coretime is [interlaced](#coretime-interlacing) or [split](#coretime-splitting) or is kept idle without assigning it to a parachain. In that case, it will be ineligible for the price-capped renewal.

### Coretime Interlacing

It is the action of dividing bulk coretime across multiple parachains that produce blocks spaced uniformly in time. For example, think of multiple parachains taking turns producing blocks, demonstrating a simple form of interlacing. This feature can be used by parachains with a low transaction volume and need not continuously produce blocks.

### Coretime Splitting

It is the action of dividing bulk coretime into multiple contiguous regions. This feature can be used by parachains that need to produce blocks continuously but do not require the whole 28 days of bulk coretime and require only part of it.

## On-Demand Coretime

Polkadot has dedicated cores assigned to provide core time on demand. These cores are excluded from the coretime sales and are reserved for on-demand parachains, which pay in DOT per block.

# Overview

## Introduction

Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol designed to support a multi-chain future by enabling secure communication and interoperability between different blockchains. Built as a Layer-0 protocol, Polkadot introduces innovations like application-specific Layer-1 chains ([parachains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/parachains/){targe=\_blank}), shared security through [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos){target=\_blank}, and cross-chain interactions via its native [Cross-Consensus Messaging Format (XCM)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank}.

This guide covers key aspects of Polkadot’s architecture, including its high-level protocol structure, blockspace commoditization, and the role of its native token, DOT, in governance, staking, and resource allocation.

## Polkadot 1.0

Polkadot 1.0 represents the state of Polkadot as of 2023, coinciding with the release of [Polkadot runtime v1.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v1.0.0){target=\_blank}. This section will focus on Polkadot 1.0, along with philosophical insights into network resilience and blockspace.

As a Layer-0 blockchain, Polkadot contributes to the multi-chain vision through several key innovations and initiatives, including:

- **Application-specific Layer-1 blockchains (parachains)** - Polkadot's sharded network allows for parallel transaction processing, with shards that can have unique state transition functions, enabling custom-built L1 chains optimized for specific applications

- **Shared security and scalability** - L1 chains connected to Polkadot benefit from its [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#nominated-proof-of-stake){target=\_blank} system, providing security out-of-the-box without the need to bootstrap their own

- **Secure interoperability** - Polkadot's native interoperability enables seamless data and value exchange between parachains. This interoperability can also be used outside of the ecosystem for bridging with external networks

- **Resilient infrastructure** - decentralized and scalable, Polkadot ensures ongoing support for development and community initiatives via its on-chain [treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury){target=\_blank} and governance

- **Rapid L1 development** - the [Polkadot SDK](/develop/parachains/intro-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank} allows fast, flexible creation and deployment of Layer-1 chains

- **Cultivating the next generation of Web3 developers** - Polkadot supports the growth of Web3 core developers through initiatives such as:

    - [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.com/blockchain-academy){target=\_blank}
    - [Polkadot Alpha Program](https://polkadot.com/alpha-program){target=\_blank}
    - [EdX courses](https://www.edx.org/school/web3x){target=\_blank}
    - Rust and Substrate courses (coming soon)

### High-Level Architecture

Polkadot features a chain that serves as the central component of the system. This chain is depicted as a ring encircled by several parachains that are connected to it.

According to Polkadot's design, any blockchain that can compile to WebAssembly (Wasm) and adheres to the Parachains Protocol becomes a parachain on the Polkadot network.

Here’s a high-level overview of the Polkadot protocol architecture:

![](/images/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/overview/overview-1.webp)

Parachains propose blocks to Polkadot validators, who check for availability and validity before finalizing them. With the relay chain providing security, collators—full nodes of parachains—can focus on their tasks without needing strong incentives.

The [Cross-Consensus Messaging Format (XCM)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank} allows parachains to exchange messages freely, leveraging the chain's security for trust-free communication.

In order to interact with chains that want to use their own finalization process (e.g., Bitcoin), Polkadot has [bridges](/polkadot-protocol/basics/interoperability/){target=\_blank} that offer two-way compatibility, meaning that transactions can be made between different parachains.

### Polkadot's Additional Functionalities

Historically, obtaining core slots on Polkadot chain relied upon crowdloans and auctions. Chain cores were leased through auctions for three-month periods, up to a maximum of two years. Crowdloans enabled users to securely lend funds to teams for lease deposits in exchange for pre-sale tokens, which is the only way to access slots on Polkadot 1.0. Auctions are now deprecated in favor of [coretime](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/coretime/){target=\_blank}.

Additionally, the chain handles [staking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking){target=\_blank}, [accounts](/polkadot-protocol/basics/accounts/){target=\_blank}, balances, and [governance](/polkadot-protocol/onchain-governance/){target=\_blank}.

#### Agile Coretime

The new and more efficient way of obtaining core on Polkadot is to go through the process of purchasing coretime.

[Agile coretime](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/agile-coretime/){target=\_blank} improves the efficient use of Polkadot's network resources and offers economic flexibility for developers, extending Polkadot's capabilities far beyond the original vision outlined in the [whitepaper](https://polkadot.com/papers/Polkadot-whitepaper.pdf){target=\_blank}.

It enables parachains to purchase monthly "bulk" allocations of coretime (the time allocated for utilizing a core, measured in Polkadot relay chain blocks), ensuring heavy-duty parachains that can author a block every six seconds with [Asynchronous Backing](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} can reliably renew their coretime each month. Although six-second block times are now the default, parachains have the option of producing blocks less frequently.

Renewal orders are prioritized over new orders, offering stability against price fluctuations and helping parachains budget more effectively for project costs.

### Polkadot's Resilience

Decentralization is a vital component of blockchain networks, but it comes with trade-offs:

- An overly decentralized network may face challenges in reaching consensus and require significant energy to operate
- Also, a network that achieves consensus quickly risks centralization, making it easier to manipulate or attack

A network should be decentralized enough to prevent manipulative or malicious influence. In this sense, decentralization is a tool for achieving resilience.

Polkadot 1.0 currently achieves resilience through several strategies:

- **Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)** - ensures that the stake per validator is maximized and evenly distributed among validators

- **Decentralized nodes** - designed to encourage operators to join the network. This program aims to expand and diversify the validators in the ecosystem who aim to become independent of the program during their term. Feel free to explore more about the program on the official [Decentralized Nodes](https://nodes.web3.foundation/){target=\_blank} page

- **On-chain treasury and governance** - known as [OpenGov](/polkadot-protocol/onchain-governance/overview/){target=\_blank}, this system allows every decision to be made through public referenda, enabling any token holder to cast a vote

### Polkadot's Blockspace

Polkadot 1.0’s design allows for the commoditization of blockspace.

Blockspace is a blockchain's capacity to finalize and commit operations, encompassing its security, computing, and storage capabilities. Its characteristics can vary across different blockchains, affecting security, flexibility, and availability.

- **Security** - measures the robustness of blockspace in Proof of Stake (PoS) networks linked to the stake locked on validator nodes, the variance in stake among validators, and the total number of validators. It also considers social centralization (how many validators are owned by single operators) and physical centralization (how many validators run on the same service provider)

- **Flexibility** - reflects the functionalities and types of data that can be stored, with high-quality data essential to avoid bottlenecks in critical processes

- **Availability** - indicates how easily users can access blockspace. It should be easily accessible, allowing diverse business models to thrive, ideally regulated by a marketplace based on demand and supplemented by options for "second-hand" blockspace

Polkadot is built on core blockspace principles, but there's room for improvement. Tasks like balance transfers, staking, and governance are managed on the relay chain.

Delegating these responsibilities to [system chains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/){target=\_blank} could enhance flexibility and allow the relay chain to concentrate on providing shared security and interoperability.

For more information about blockspace, watch [Robert Habermeier’s interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1vISppPwe4){target=\_blank} or read his [technical blog post](https://www.rob.tech/blog/polkadot-blockspace-over-blockchains/){target=\_blank}.

## DOT Token

DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network, much like BTC for Bitcoin and Ether for the Ethereum blockchain. DOT has 10 decimals, uses the Planck base unit, and has a balance type of `u128`. The same is true for Kusama's KSM token with the exception of having 12 decimals.

### Redenomination of DOT
    
Polkadot conducted a community poll, which ended on 27 July 2020 at block 888,888, to decide whether to redenominate the DOT token. The stakeholders chose to redenominate the token, changing the value of 1 DOT from 1e12 plancks to 1e10 plancks.

Importantly, this did not affect the network's total number of base units (plancks); it only affects how a single DOT is represented. The redenomination became effective 72 hours after transfers were enabled, occurring at block 1,248,328 on 21 August 2020 around 16:50 UTC.

### The Planck Unit

The smallest unit of account balance on Polkadot SDK-based blockchains (such as Polkadot and Kusama) is called _Planck_, named after the Planck length, the smallest measurable distance in the physical universe.

Similar to how BTC's smallest unit is the Satoshi and ETH's is the Wei, Polkadot's native token DOT equals 1e10 Planck, while Kusama's native token KSM equals 1e12 Planck.

### Uses for DOT

DOT serves three primary functions within the Polkadot network:

- **Governance** - it is used to participate in the governance of the network
- **Staking** - DOT is staked to support the network's operation and security
- **Buying coretime** - used to purchase coretime in-bulk or on-demand and access the  chain to benefit from Polkadot's security and interoperability

Additionally, DOT can serve as a transferable token. For example, DOT, held in the treasury, can be allocated to teams developing projects that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem.

## JAM and the Road Ahead

The Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) represents a transformative redesign of Polkadot's core architecture, envisioned as the successor to the current relay chain. Unlike traditional blockchain architectures, JAM introduces a unique computational model that processes work through two primary functions:

- **Join** - handles data integration
- **Accumulate** - folds computations into the chain's state

JAM removes many of the opinions and constraints of the current relay chain while maintaining its core security properties. Expected improvements include:

- **Permissionless code execution** - JAM is designed to be more generic and flexible, allowing for permissionless code execution through services that can be deployed without governance approval
- **More effective block time utilization** - JAM's efficient pipeline processing model places the prior state root in block headers instead of the posterior state root, enabling more effective utilization of block time for computations

This architectural evolution promises to enhance Polkadot's scalability and flexibility while maintaining robust security guarantees. JAM is planned to be rolled out to Polkadot as a single, complete upgrade rather than a stream of smaller updates. This approach seeks to minimize the developer overhead required to address any breaking changes.

# Proof of Stake Consensus

## Introduction

Polkadot's Proof of Stake consensus model leverages a unique hybrid approach by design to promote decentralized and secure network operations. In traditional Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, a node's ability to validate transactions is tied to its token holdings, which can lead to centralization risks and limited validator participation. Polkadot addresses these concerns through its [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos){target=\_blank} model and a combination of advanced consensus mechanisms to ensure efficient block production and strong finality guarantees. This combination enables the Polkadot network to scale while maintaining security and decentralization.

## Nominated Proof of Stake

Polkadot uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) to select the validator set and secure the network. This model is designed to maximize decentralization and security by balancing the roles of [validators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-validator){target=\_blank} and [nominators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nominator){target=\_blank}.

- **Validators** - play a key role in maintaining the network's integrity. They produce new blocks, validate parachain blocks, and ensure the finality of transactions across the relay chain
- **Nominators** - support the network by selecting validators to back with their stake. This mechanism allows users who don't want to run a validator node to still participate in securing the network and earn rewards based on the validators they support

In Polkadot's NPoS system, nominators can delegate their tokens to trusted validators, giving them voting power in selecting validators while spreading security responsibilities across the network.

## Hybrid Consensus

Polkadot employs a hybrid consensus model that combines two key protocols: a finality gadget called [GRANDPA](#finality-gadget-grandpa) and a block production mechanism known as [BABE](#block-production-babe). This hybrid approach enables the network to benefit from both rapid block production and provable finality, ensuring security and performance.

The hybrid consensus model has some key advantages:

- **Probabilistic finality** - with BABE constantly producing new blocks, Polkadot ensures that the network continues to make progress, even when a final decision has not yet been reached on which chain is the true canonical chain

- **Provable finality** - GRANDPA guarantees that once a block is finalized, it can never be reverted, ensuring that all network participants agree on the finalized chain

By using separate protocols for block production and finality, Polkadot can achieve rapid block creation and strong guarantees of finality while avoiding the typical trade-offs seen in traditional consensus mechanisms.

## Block Production - BABE

Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is Polkadot's block production mechanism, working with GRANDPA to ensure blocks are produced consistently across the network. As validators participate in BABE, they are assigned block production slots through a randomness-based lottery system. This helps determine which validator is responsible for producing a block at a given time. BABE shares similarities with [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf){target=\_blank} but differs in key aspects like chain selection rules and slot timing.

Key features of BABE include:

- **Epochs and slots** - BABE operates in phases called epochs, each of which is divided into slots (around 6 seconds per slot). Validators are assigned slots at the beginning of each epoch based on stake and randomness

- **Randomized block production** - validators enter a lottery to determine which will produce a block in a specific slot. This randomness is sourced from the relay chain's [randomness cycle](/polkadot-protocol/basics/randomness/){target=\_blank}

- **Multiple block producers per slot** - in some cases, more than one validator might win the lottery for the same slot, resulting in multiple blocks being produced. These blocks are broadcasted, and the network's fork choice rule helps decide which chain to follow

- **Handling empty slots** - if no validators win the lottery for a slot, a secondary selection algorithm ensures that a block is still produced. Validators selected through this method always produce a block, ensuring no slots are skipped

BABE's combination of randomness and slot allocation creates a secure, decentralized system for consistent block production while also allowing for fork resolution when multiple validators produce blocks for the same slot.

### Validator Participation

In BABE, validators participate in a lottery for every slot to determine whether they are responsible for producing a block during that slot. This process's randomness ensures a decentralized and unpredictable block production mechanism.

There are two lottery outcomes for any given slot that initiate additional processes:

- **Multiple validators in a slot** - due to the randomness, multiple validators can be selected to produce a block for the same slot. When this happens, each validator produces a block and broadcasts it to the network resulting in a race condition. The network's topology and latency then determine which block reaches the majority of nodes first. BABE allows both chains to continue building until the finalization process resolves which one becomes canonical. The [Fork Choice](#fork-choice) rule is then used to decide which chain the network should follow

- **No validators in a slot** - on occasions when no validator is selected by the lottery, a [secondary validator selection algorithm](https://spec.polkadot.network/sect-block-production#defn-babe-secondary-slots){target=\_blank} steps in. This backup ensures that a block is still produced, preventing skipped slots. However, if the primary block produced by a verifiable random function [(VRF)-selected](/polkadot-protocol/basics/randomness/#vrf){target=\_blank} validator exists for that slot, the secondary block will be ignored. As a result, every slot will have either a primary or a secondary block

This design ensures continuous block production, even in cases of multiple competing validators or an absence of selected validators.

For BABE technical definitions, constants, and formulas, see the [Block Production Lottery](https://spec.polkadot.network/sect-block-production#sect-block-production-lottery){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot Protocol Specification.

## Finality Gadget - GRANDPA

GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement) serves as the finality gadget for Polkadot's relay chain. Operating alongside the BABE block production mechanism, it ensures provable finality, giving participants confidence that blocks finalized by GRANDPA cannot be reverted.

Key features of GRANDPA include:

- **Independent finality service** – GRANDPA runs separately from the block production process, operating in parallel to ensure seamless finalization
- **Chain-based finalization** – instead of finalizing one block at a time, GRANDPA finalizes entire chains, speeding up the process significantly
- **Batch finalization** – can finalize multiple blocks in a single round, enhancing efficiency and minimizing delays in the network
- **Partial synchrony tolerance** – GRANDPA works effectively in a partially synchronous network environment, managing both asynchronous and synchronous conditions
- **Byzantine fault tolerance** – can handle up to 1/5 Byzantine (malicious) nodes, ensuring the system remains secure even when faced with adversarial behavior

??? note "What is GHOST?"
    [GHOST (Greedy Heaviest-Observed Subtree)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf){target=\blank} is a consensus protocol used in blockchain networks to select the heaviest branch in a block tree. Unlike traditional longest-chain rules, GHOST can more efficiently handle high block production rates by considering the weight of subtrees rather than just the chain length.

### Probabilistic vs. Provable Finality

In traditional Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, finality is probabilistic. As blocks are added to the chain, the probability that a block is final increases, but it can never be guaranteed. Eventual consensus means that all nodes will agree on a single version of the blockchain over time, but this process can be unpredictable and slow.

Conversely, GRANDPA provides provable finality, which means that once a block is finalized, it is irreversible. By using Byzantine fault-tolerant agreements, GRANDPA finalizes blocks more efficiently and securely than probabilistic mechanisms like Nakamoto consensus. Like Ethereum's Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), GRANDPA ensures that finalized blocks cannot be reverted, offering stronger consensus guarantees.

### Additional Resources

For technical insights, including formal proofs and detailed algorithms, see the [GRANDPA paper](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf){target=\_blank} from Web3 Foundation.

For a deeper look at the code behind GRANDPA, see the following GitHub repositories:

- [GRANDPA Rust implementation](https://github.com/paritytech/finality-grandpa){target=\_blank}
- [GRANDPA Pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame/grandpa/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}

## Fork Choice

The fork choice of the relay chain combines BABE and GRANDPA:

1. BABE must always build on the chain that GRANDPA has finalized
2. When there are forks after the finalized head, BABE builds on the chain with the most primary blocks to provide probabilistic finality 

![Fork choice diagram](/images/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/consensus-protocols-1.webp)

In the preceding diagram, finalized blocks are black, and non-finalized blocks are yellow. Primary blocks are labeled '1', and secondary blocks are labeled '2.' The topmost chain is the longest chain originating from the last finalized block, but it is not selected because it only has one primary block at the time of evaluation. In comparison, the one below it originates from the last finalized block and has three primary blocks.

### Additional Resources

To learn more about how BABE and GRANDPA work together to produce and finalize blocks on Kusama, see this [Block Production and Finalization in Polkadot](https://youtu.be/FiEAnVECa8c){target=\_blank} talk from Web3 Foundation's Bill Laboon.

## Bridging - BEEFY

Bridge Efficiency Enabling Finality Yielder (BEEFY) is a specialized protocol that extends the finality guarantees provided by GRANDPA. It is specifically designed to facilitate efficient bridging between Polkadot relay chains (such as Polkadot and Kusama) and external blockchains like Ethereum. While GRANDPA is well-suited for finalizing blocks within Polkadot, it has limitations when bridging external chains that weren't built with Polkadot's interoperability features in mind. BEEFY addresses these limitations by ensuring other networks can efficiently verify finality proofs.

Key features of BEEFY include:

- **Efficient finality proof verification** - BEEFY enables external networks to easily verify Polkadot finality proofs, ensuring seamless communication between chains
- **Merkle Mountain Ranges (MMR)** - this data structure is used to efficiently store and transmit proofs between chains, optimizing data storage and reducing transmission overhead
- **ECDSA signature schemes** - BEEFY uses ECDSA signatures, which are widely supported on Ethereum and other EVM-based chains, making integration with these ecosystems smoother
- **Light client optimization** - BEEFY reduces the computational burden on light clients by allowing them to check for a super-majority of validator votes rather than needing to process all validator signatures, improving performance

# Asset Hub

## Introduction

The Asset Hub is a critical component in the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling the management of fungible and non-fungible assets across the network. Since the relay chain focuses on maintaining security and consensus without direct asset management, Asset Hub provides a streamlined platform for creating, managing, and using on-chain assets in a fee-efficient manner. This guide outlines the core features of Asset Hub, including how it handles asset operations, cross-chain transfers, and asset integration using XCM, as well as essential tools like [API Sidecar](#api-sidecar) and [`TxWrapper`](#txwrapper) for developers working with on-chain assets.

## Assets Basics

In the Polkadot ecosystem, the relay chain does not natively support additional assets beyond its native token (DOT for Polkadot, KSM for Kusama). The Asset Hub parachain on Polkadot and Kusama provides a fungible and non-fungible assets framework. Asset Hub allows developers and users to create, manage, and use assets across the ecosystem.

Asset creators can use Asset Hub to track their asset issuance across multiple parachains and manage assets through operations such as minting, burning, and transferring. Projects that need a standardized method of handling on-chain assets will find this particularly useful. The fungible asset interface provided by Asset Hub closely resembles Ethereum's ERC-20 standard but is directly integrated into Polkadot's runtime, making it more efficient in terms of speed and transaction fees.

Integrating with Asset Hub offers several key benefits, particularly for infrastructure providers and users:

- **Support for non-native on-chain assets** - Asset Hub enables seamless asset creation and management, allowing projects to develop tokens or assets that can interact with the broader ecosystem
- **Lower transaction fees** - Asset Hub offers significantly lower transaction costs—approximately one-tenth of the fees on the relay chain, providing cost-efficiency for regular operations
- **Reduced deposit requirements** - depositing assets in Asset Hub is more accessible, with deposit requirements that are around one one-hundredth of those on the relay chain
- **Payment of transaction fees with non-native assets** - users can pay transaction fees in assets other than the native token (DOT or KSM), offering more flexibility for developers and users

Assets created on the Asset Hub are stored as part of a map, where each asset has a unique ID that links to information about the asset, including details like:

- The management team
- The total supply
- The number of accounts holding the asset
- Sufficiency for account existence - whether the asset alone is enough to maintain an account without a native token balance
- The metadata of the asset, including its name, symbol, and the number of decimals for representation

Some assets can be regarded as sufficient to maintain an account's existence, meaning that users can create accounts on the network without needing a native token balance (i.e., no existential deposit required). Developers can also set minimum balances for their assets. If an account's balance drops below the minimum, the balance is considered dust and may be cleared.

## Assets Pallet

The Polkadot SDK's Assets pallet is a powerful module designated for creating and managing fungible asset classes with a fixed supply. It offers a secure and flexible way to issue, transfer, freeze, and destroy assets. The pallet supports various operations and includes permissioned and non-permissioned functions to cater to simple and advanced use cases.

Visit the [Assets Pallet Rust docs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_assets/index.html){target=\_blank} for more in-depth information.

### Key Features

Key features of the Assets pallet include:

- **Asset issuance** - allows the creation of a new asset, where the total supply is assigned to the creator's account
- **Asset transfer** - enables transferring assets between accounts while maintaining a balance in both accounts
- **Asset freezing** - prevents transfers of a specific asset from one account, locking it from further transactions
- **Asset destruction** - allows accounts to burn or destroy their holdings, removing those assets from circulation
- **Non-custodial transfers** - a non-custodial mechanism to enable one account to approve a transfer of assets on behalf of another

### Main Functions

The Assets pallet provides a broad interface for managing fungible assets. Some of the main dispatchable functions include:

- **`create()`** - create a new asset class by placing a deposit, applicable when asset creation is permissionless
- **`issue()`** - mint a fixed supply of a new asset and assign it to the creator's account
- **`transfer()`** - transfer a specified amount of an asset between two accounts
- **`approve_transfer()`** - approve a non-custodial transfer, allowing a third party to move assets between accounts
- **`destroy()`** - destroy an entire asset class, removing it permanently from the chain
- **`freeze()` and `thaw()`** - administrators or privileged users can lock or unlock assets from being transferred

For a full list of dispatchable and privileged functions, see the [dispatchables Rust docs](https://docs.rs/pallet-assets/latest/pallet_assets/pallet/enum.Call.html){target=\_blank}.

### Querying Functions

The Assets pallet exposes several key querying functions that developers can interact with programmatically. These functions allow you to query asset information and perform operations essential for managing assets across accounts. The two main querying functions are:

- **`balance(asset_id, account)`** - retrieves the balance of a given asset for a specified account. Useful for checking the holdings of an asset class across different accounts

- **`total_supply(asset_id)`** - returns the total supply of the asset identified by `asset_id`. Allows users to verify how much of the asset exists on-chain

In addition to these basic functions, other utility functions are available for querying asset metadata and performing asset transfers. You can view the complete list of querying functions in the [Struct Pallet Rust docs](https://docs.rs/pallet-assets/latest/pallet_assets/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank}.

### Permission Models and Roles

The Assets pallet incorporates a robust permission model, enabling control over who can perform specific operations like minting, transferring, or freezing assets. The key roles within the permission model are:

- **Admin** - can freeze (preventing transfers) and forcibly transfer assets between accounts. Admins also have the power to reduce the balance of an asset class across arbitrary accounts. They manage the more sensitive and administrative aspects of the asset class
- **Issuer** - responsible for minting new tokens. When new assets are created, the Issuer is the account that controls their distribution to other accounts
- **Freezer** - can lock the transfer of assets from an account, preventing the account holder from moving their balance. This function is useful for freezing accounts involved in disputes or fraud
- **Owner** - has overarching control, including destroying an entire asset class. Owners can also set or update the Issuer, Freezer, and Admin roles

These permissions provide fine-grained control over assets, enabling developers and asset managers to ensure secure, controlled operations. Each of these roles is crucial for managing asset lifecycles and ensuring that assets are used appropriately across the network.

### Asset Freezing

The Assets pallet allows you to freeze assets. This feature prevents transfers or spending from a specific account, effectively locking the balance of an asset class until it is explicitly unfrozen. Asset freezing is beneficial when assets are restricted due to security concerns or disputes.

Freezing assets is controlled by the Freezer role, as mentioned earlier. Only the account with the Freezer privilege can perform these operations. Here are the key freezing functions:

- **`freeze(asset_id, account)`** - locks the specified asset of the account. While the asset is frozen, no transfers can be made from the frozen account
- **`thaw(asset_id, account)`** - corresponding function for unfreezing, allowing the asset to be transferred again

This approach enables secure and flexible asset management, providing administrators the tools to control asset movement in special circumstances.

### Non-Custodial Transfers (Approval API)

The Assets pallet also supports non-custodial transfers through the Approval API. This feature allows one account to approve another account to transfer a specific amount of its assets to a third-party recipient without granting full control over the account's balance. Non-custodial transfers enable secure transactions where trust is required between multiple parties.

Here's a brief overview of the key functions for non-custodial asset transfers:

- **`approve_transfer(asset_id, delegate, amount)`** - approves a delegate to transfer up to a certain amount of the asset on behalf of the original account holder
- **`cancel_approval(asset_id, delegate)`** - cancels a previous approval for the delegate. Once canceled, the delegate no longer has permission to transfer the approved amount
- **`transfer_approved(asset_id, owner, recipient, amount)`** - executes the approved asset transfer from the owner’s account to the recipient. The delegate account can call this function once approval is granted

These delegated operations make it easier to manage multi-step transactions and dApps that require complex asset flows between participants.

## Foreign Assets

Foreign assets in Asset Hub refer to assets originating from external blockchains or parachains that are registered in the Asset Hub. These assets are typically native tokens from other parachains within the Polkadot ecosystem or bridged tokens from external blockchains such as Ethereum.

Once a foreign asset is registered in the Asset Hub by its originating blockchain's root origin, users are able to send these tokens to the Asset Hub and interact with them as they would any other asset within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Handling Foreign Assets

The Foreign Assets pallet, an instance of the Assets pallet, manages these assets. Since foreign assets are integrated into the same interface as native assets, developers can use the same functionalities, such as transferring and querying balances. However, there are important distinctions when dealing with foreign assets.

- **Asset identifier** - unlike native assets, foreign assets are identified using an XCM Multilocation rather than a simple numeric `AssetId`. This multilocation identifier represents the cross-chain location of the asset and provides a standardized way to reference it across different parachains and relay chains

- **Transfers** - once registered in the Asset Hub, foreign assets can be transferred between accounts, just like native assets. Users can also send these assets back to their originating blockchain if supported by the relevant cross-chain messaging mechanisms

## Integration

Asset Hub supports a variety of integration tools that make it easy for developers to manage assets and interact with the blockchain in their applications. The tools and libraries provided by Parity Technologies enable streamlined operations, such as querying asset information, building transactions, and monitoring cross-chain asset transfers.

Developers can integrate Asset Hub into their projects using these core tools:

### API Sidecar

[API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar){target=\_blank} is a RESTful service that can be deployed alongside Polkadot and Kusama nodes. It provides endpoints to retrieve real-time blockchain data, including asset information. When used with Asset Hub, Sidecar allows querying:

- **Asset look-ups** - retrieve specific assets using `AssetId`
- **Asset balances** - view the balance of a particular asset on Asset Hub

Public instances of API Sidecar connected to Asset Hub are available, such as:

- [Polkadot Asset Hub Sidecar](https://polkadot-asset-hub-public-sidecar.parity-chains.parity.io/){target=\_blank}
- [Kusama Asset Hub Sidecar](https://kusama-asset-hub-public-sidecar.parity-chains.parity.io/){target=\_blank}

These public instances are primarily for ad-hoc testing and quick checks.

### TxWrapper

[`TxWrapper`](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core){target=\_blank} is a library that simplifies constructing and signing transactions for Polkadot SDK-based chains, including Polkadot and Kusama. This tool includes support for working with Asset Hub, enabling developers to:

- Construct offline transactions
- Leverage asset-specific functions such as minting, burning, and transferring assets

`TxWrapper` provides the flexibility needed to integrate asset operations into custom applications while maintaining the security and efficiency of Polkadot's transaction model.

### Asset Transfer API

[Asset Transfer API](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api){target=\_blank} is a library focused on simplifying the construction of asset transfers for Polkadot SDK-based chains that involve system parachains like Asset Hub. It exposes a reduced set of methods that facilitate users sending transfers to other parachains or locally. Refer to the [cross-chain support table](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api/tree/main#current-cross-chain-support){target=\_blank} for the current status of cross-chain support development.

Key features include:

- Support for cross-chain transfers between parachains
- Streamlined transaction construction with support for the necessary parachain metadata

The API supports various asset operations, such as paying transaction fees with non-native tokens and managing asset liquidity.

### Parachain Node

To fully leverage the Asset Hub's functionality, developers will need to run a system parachain node. Setting up an Asset Hub node allows users to interact with the parachain in real time, syncing data and participating in the broader Polkadot ecosystem. Guidelines for setting up an [Asset Hub node](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus#asset-hub-){target=\_blank} are available in the Parity documentation.

Using these integration tools, developers can manage assets seamlessly and integrate Asset Hub functionality into their applications, leveraging Polkadot's powerful infrastructure.

## XCM Transfer Monitoring

Since Asset Hub facilitates cross-chain asset transfers across the Polkadot ecosystem, XCM transfer monitoring becomes an essential practice for developers and infrastructure providers. This section outlines how to monitor the cross-chain movement of assets between parachains, the relay chain, and other systems.

### Monitor XCM Deposits

As assets move between chains, tracking the cross-chain transfers in real time is crucial. Whether assets are transferred via a teleport from system parachains or through a reserve-backed transfer from any other parachain, each transfer emits a relevant event (such as the `balances.minted` event).

To ensure accurate monitoring of these events:

- **Track XCM deposits** - query every new block created in the relay chain or Asset Hub, loop through the events array, and filter for any `balances.minted` events which confirm the asset was successfully transferred to the account
- **Track event origins** - each `balances.minted` event points to a specific address. By monitoring this, service providers can verify that assets have arrived in the correct account

### Track XCM Information Back to the Source

While the `balances.minted` event confirms the arrival of assets, there may be instances where you need to trace the origin of the cross-chain message that triggered the event. In such cases, you can:

1. Query the relevant chain at the block where the `balances.minted` event was emitted
2. Look for a `messageQueue(Processed)` event within that block's initialization. This event contains a parameter (`Id`) that identifies the cross-chain message received by the relay chain or Asset Hub. You can use this `Id` to trace the message back to its origin chain, offering full visibility of the asset transfer's journey

### Practical Monitoring Examples

The preceding sections outline the process of monitoring XCM deposits to specific accounts and then tracing back the origin of these deposits. The process of tracking an XCM transfer and the specific events to monitor may vary based on the direction of the XCM message. Here are some examples to showcase the slight differences:

- **Transfer from parachain to relay chain** - track `parachainsystem(UpwardMessageSent)` on the parachain and `messagequeue(Processed)` on the relay chain
- **Transfer from relay chain to parachain** - track `xcmPallet(sent)` on the relay chain and `dmpqueue(ExecutedDownward)` on the parachain
- **Transfer between parachains** - track `xcmpqueue(XcmpMessageSent)` on the system parachain and `xcmpqueue(Success)` on the destination parachain

### Monitor for Failed XCM Transfers

Sometimes, XCM transfers may fail due to liquidity or other errors. Failed transfers emit specific error events, which are key to resolving issues in asset transfers. Monitoring for these failure events helps catch issues before they affect asset balances.

- **Relay chain to system parachain** - look for the `dmpqueue(ExecutedDownward)` event on the parachain with an `Incomplete` outcome and an error type such as `UntrustedReserveLocation`
- **Parachain to parachain** - monitor for `xcmpqueue(Fail)` on the destination parachain with error types like `TooExpensive`

For detailed error management in XCM, see Gavin Wood's blog post on [XCM Execution and Error Management](https://www.polkadot.network/blog/xcm-part-three-execution-and-error-management){target=\_blank}.

# Bridge Hub

## Introduction

The Bridge Hub system parachain plays a crucial role in facilitating trustless interactions between Polkadot, Kusama, Ethereum, and other blockchain ecosystems. By implementing on-chain light clients and supporting protocols like BEEFY and GRANDPA, Bridge Hub ensures seamless message transmission and state verification across chains. It also provides essential [pallets](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#pallet){target=\_blank} for sending and receiving messages, making it a cornerstone of Polkadot’s interoperability framework. With built-in support for XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging), Bridge Hub enables secure, efficient communication between diverse blockchain networks.

This guide covers the architecture, components, and deployment of the Bridge Hub system. You'll explore its trustless bridging mechanisms, key pallets for various blockchains, and specific implementations like Snowbridge and the Polkadot <> Kusama bridge. By the end, you'll understand how Bridge Hub enhances connectivity within the Polkadot ecosystem and beyond.

## Trustless Bridging

Bridge Hub provides a mode of trustless bridging through its implementation of on-chain light clients and trustless relayers. Trustless bridges are essentially two one-way bridges, where each chain has a method of verifying the state of the other in a trustless manner through consensus proofs. In this context, "trustless" refers to the lack of need to trust a human when interacting with various system components. Trustless systems are based instead on trusting mathematics, cryptography, and code. The target chain and source chain both provide ways of verifying one another's state and actions (such as a transfer) based on the consensus and finality of both chains rather than an external mechanism controlled by a third party.

[BEEFY (Bridge Efficiency Enabling Finality Yielder)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#bridging-beefy){target=\_blank} is instrumental in this solution. It provides a more efficient way to verify the consensus on the relay chain. It allows the participants in a network to verify finality proofs, meaning a remote chain like Ethereum can verify the state of Polkadot at a given block height. 

For example, the Ethereum and Polkadot bridging solution that [Snowbridge](https://docs.snowbridge.network/){target=\_blank} implements involves two light clients: one which verifies the state of Polkadot and the other which verifies the state of Ethereum. The light client for Polkadot is implemented in the runtime as a pallet, whereas the light client for Ethereum is implemented as a smart contract on the beacon chain.

## Bridging Components

In any given Bridge Hub implementation (Kusama, Polkadot, or other relay chains), there are a few primary pallets that are utilized:

- [**Pallet Bridge GRANDPA**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_bridge_grandpa/index.html){target=\_blank} - an on-chain GRANDPA light client for Substrate based chains
- [**Pallet Bridge Parachains**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_bridge_parachains/index.html){target=\_blank} - a finality module for parachains
- [**Pallet Bridge Messages**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_bridge_messages/index.html){target=\_blank} - a pallet which allows sending, receiving, and tracking of inbound and outbound messages 
- [**Pallet XCM Bridge**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm_bridge_hub/index.html){target=\_blank} - a pallet which, with the Bridge Messages pallet, adds XCM support to bridge pallets

### Ethereum-Specific Support

Bridge Hub also has a set of components and pallets that support a bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum through [Snowbridge](https://github.com/Snowfork/snowbridge){target=\_blank}.

To view the complete list of which pallets are included in Bridge Hub, visit the Subscan [Runtime Modules](https://bridgehub-polkadot.subscan.io/runtime){target=\_blank} page. Alternatively, the source code for those pallets can be found in the Polkadot SDK [Snowbridge Pallets](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/bridges/snowbridge/pallets){target=\_blank} repository.

## Deployed Bridges

- [**Snowbridge**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-snowbridge){target=\_blank} - a general-purpose, trustless bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum
- [**Hyperbridge**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-hyperbridge){target=\_blank} - a cross-chain solution built as an interoperability coprocessor, providing state-proof-based interoperability across all blockchains
- [**Polkadot <> Kusama Bridge**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-dot-ksm-bridge){target=\_blank} - a bridge that utilizes relayers to bridge the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains trustlessly

title: Coretime
description: Learn about the role of the Coretime system parachain, which facilitates the sale, purchase, assignment, and mechanisms of bulk coretime.
---

## Introduction

The Coretime system chain facilitates the allocation, procurement, sale, and scheduling of bulk [coretime](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#coretime){target=\_blank}, enabling tasks (such as [parachains](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#parachain){target=\_blank}) to utilize the computation and security provided by Polkadot. 

The [Broker pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/index.html){target=\_blank}, along with [Cross Consensus Messaging (XCM)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank}, enables this functionality to be delegated to the system chain rather than the relay chain. Using [XCMP's Upward Message Passing (UMP)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport#ump-upward-message-passing){target=\_blank} to the relay chain allows for core assignments to take place for a task registered on the relay chain.

The Fellowship RFC [RFC-1: Agile Coretime](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0001-agile-coretime.md){target=\_blank} contains the specification for the Coretime system chain and coretime as a concept.

Besides core management, its responsibilities include: 

- The number of cores that should be made available
- Which tasks should be running on which cores and in what ratios
- Accounting information for the on-demand pool

From the relay chain, it expects the following via [Downward Message Passing (DMP)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport#dmp-downward-message-passing){target=\_blank}:

- The number of cores available to be scheduled
- Account information on on-demand scheduling

The details for this interface can be found in [RFC-5: Coretime Interface](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0005-coretime-interface.md){target=\_blank}.

## Bulk Coretime Assignment

The Coretime chain allocates coretime before its usage. It also manages the ownership of a core. As cores are made up of regions (by default, one core is a single region), a region is recognized as a non-fungible asset. The Coretime chain exposes Regions over XCM as an NFT. Users can transfer individual regions, partition, interlace, or allocate them to a task. Regions describe how a task may use a core.

A core can be considered a logical representation of an active validator set on the relay chain, where these validators commit to verifying the state changes for a particular task running on that region. With partitioning, having more than one region per core is possible, allowing for different computational schemes. Therefore, running more than one task on a single core is possible.

Regions can be managed in the following manner on the Coretime chain:

- **Assigning region** - regions can be assigned to a task on the relay chain, such as a parachain/rollup using the [`assign`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/pallet/dispatchables/fn.assign.html){target=\_blank} dispatchable

- **Transferring regions** - regions may be transferred on the Coretime chain, upon which the [`transfer`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/pallet/dispatchables/fn.transfer.html){target=\_blank} [dispatchable](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#dispatchable){target=\_blank} in the Broker pallet would assign a new owner to that specific region

- **Partitioning regions** - using the [`partition`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/pallet/dispatchables/fn.partition.html){target=\_blank} dispatchable, regions may be partitioned into two non-overlapping subregions within the same core. A partition involves specifying a *pivot*, wherein the new region will be defined and available for use

- **Interlacing regions** - using the [`interlace`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/pallet/dispatchables/fn.interlace.html){target=\_blank} dispatchable, interlacing regions allows a core to have alternative-compute strategies. Whereas partitioned regions are mutually exclusive, interlaced regions overlap because multiple tasks may utilize a single core in an alternating manner

When bulk coretime is obtained, block production is not immediately available. It becomes available to produce blocks for a task in the next Coretime cycle. To view the status of the current or next Coretime cycle, see the [Subscan Coretime Dashboard](https://coretime-polkadot.subscan.io/coretime_dashboard){target=\_blank}.

For more information regarding these mechanisms, see the coretime page on the Polkadot Wiki: [Introduction to Agile Coretime](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-agile-coretime){target=\_blank}. 

## On Demand Coretime

At this writing, on-demand coretime is currently deployed on the relay chain and will eventually be deployed to the Coretime chain. On-demand coretime allows parachains (previously known as parathreads) to utilize available cores per block.

The Coretime chain also handles coretime sales, details of which can be found on the Polkadot Wiki: [Agile Coretime: Coretime Sales](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-agile-coretime#coretime-sales){target=\_blank}.

# System Chains

Explore the critical roles Polkadot’s system chains play in enhancing the network’s efficiency and scalability. From managing on-chain assets with the Asset Hub to enabling seamless Web3 integration through the Bridge Hub and facilitating coretime operations with the Coretime chain, each system chain is designed to offload specialized tasks from the relay chain, optimizing the entire ecosystem.

These system chains are integral to Polkadot's architecture, ensuring that the relay chain remains focused on consensus and security while system chains handle vital functions like asset management, cross-chain communication, and resource allocation. By distributing responsibilities across specialized chains, Polkadot maintains high performance, scalability, and flexibility, enabling developers to build more efficient and interconnected blockchain solutions.

description: Discover how system parachains enhance Polkadot's scalability and performance by offloading tasks like governance, asset management, and bridging from the relay chain.
---

## Introduction

Polkadot's relay chain is designed to secure parachains and facilitate seamless inter-chain communication. However, resource-intensive—tasks like governance, asset management, and bridging are more efficiently handled by system parachains. These specialized chains offload functionality from the relay chain, leveraging Polkadot's parallel execution model to improve performance and scalability. By distributing key functionalities across system parachains, Polkadot can maximize its relay chain's blockspace for its core purpose of securing and validating parachains.

This guide will explore how system parachains operate within Polkadot and Kusama, detailing their critical roles in network governance, asset management, and bridging. You'll learn about the currently deployed system parachains, their unique functions, and how they enhance Polkadot's decentralized ecosystem.

## System Chains

System parachains contain core Polkadot protocol features, but in parachains rather than the relay chain. Execution cores for system chains are allocated via network [governance](/polkadot-protocol/onchain-governance/overview/){target=\_blank} rather than purchasing coretime on a marketplace.

System parachains defer to on-chain governance to manage their upgrades and other sensitive actions as they do not have native tokens or governance systems separate from DOT or KSM. It is not uncommon to see a system parachain implemented specifically to manage network governance.

!!!note
    You may see system parachains called common good parachains in articles and discussions. This nomenclature caused confusion as the network evolved, so system parachains is preferred. 
    
    For more details on this evolution, review this [parachains forum discussion](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-protocol-and-common-good-parachains/866){target=\_blank}.

```

All system parachains are on both Polkadot and Kusama with the following exceptions:

- [**Collectives**](#collectives) - only on Polkadot
- [**Encointer**](#encointer) - only on Kusama

### Asset Hub

The [Asset Hub](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/cumulus#asset-hub-){target=\_blank} is an asset portal for the entire network. It helps asset creators, such as reserve-backed stablecoin issuers, track the total issuance of an asset in the network, including amounts transferred to other parachains. It also serves as the hub where asset creators can perform on-chain operations, such as minting and burning, to manage their assets effectively.

This asset management logic is encoded directly in the runtime of the chain rather than in smart contracts. The efficiency of executing logic in a parachain allows for fees and deposits that are about 1/10th of what is required on the relay chain. These low fees mean that the Asset Hub is well suited for handling the frequent transactions required when managing balances, transfers, and on-chain assets.

The Asset Hub also supports non-fungible assets (NFTs) via the [Uniques pallet](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/extrinsics#uniques){target=\_blank} and [NFTs pallet](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/extrinsics#nfts){target=\_blank}. For more information about NFTs, see the Polkadot Wiki section on [NFT Pallets](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nft-pallets){target=\_blank}.

### Collectives

The Polkadot Collectives parachain was added in [Referendum 81](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/81){target=\_blank} and exists on Polkadot but not on Kusama. The Collectives chain hosts on-chain collectives that serve the Polkadot network, including the following:

- [**Polkadot Alliance**](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/94){target=\_blank} - provides a set of ethics and standards for the community to follow. Includes an on-chain means to call out bad actors
- [**Polkadot Technical Fellowship**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship){target=\_blank} - a rules-based social organization to support and incentivize highly-skilled developers to contribute to the technical stability, security, and progress of the network

These on-chain collectives will play essential roles in the future of network stewardship and decentralized governance. Networks can use a bridge hub to help them act as collectives and express their legislative voices as single opinions within other networks.

### Bridge Hub

Before parachains, the only way to design a bridge was to put the logic onto the relay chain. Since both networks now support parachains and the isolation they provide, each network can have a parachain dedicated to bridges. 

The Bridge Hub system parachain operates on the relay chain, and is responsible for faciliating bridges to the wider Web3 space. It contains the required bridge [pallets](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#pallet){target=\_blank} in its runtime, which enable trustless bridging with other blockchain networks like Polkadot, Kusama, and Ethereum. The Bridge Hub uses the native token of the relay chain.

See the [Bridge Hub](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/bridge-hub/){target=\_blank} documentation for additional information.

### People Chain

The People Chain provides a naming system that allows users to manage and verify their account [identity](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-identity){target=\_blank}.

### Coretime Chain

The Coretime system chain lets users buy coretime to access Polkadot's computation. [Coretime marketplaces](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-coretime-marketplaces){target=\_blank} run on top of the Coretime chain. Kusama does not use the Collectives system chain. Instead, Kusama relies on the Encointer system chain, which provides Sybil resistance as a service to the entire Kusama ecosystem.

Visit [Introduction to Agile Coretime](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-agile-coretime#introduction-to-agile-coretime){target=\_blank} in the Polkadot Wiki for more information.

### Encointer

[Encointer](https://encointer.org/encointer-for-web3/){target=\_blank} is a blockchain platform for self-sovereign ID and a global [universal basic income (UBI)](https://book.encointer.org/economics-ubi.html){target=\_blank}. The Encointer protocol uses a novel Proof of Personhood (PoP) system to create unique identities and resist Sybil attacks. PoP is based on the notion that a person can only be in one place at any given time. Encointer offers a framework that allows for any group of real people to create, distribute, and use their own digital community tokens.

Participants are requested to attend physical key-signing ceremonies with small groups of random people at randomized locations. These local meetings are part of one global signing ceremony occurring at the same time. Participants use the Encointer wallet app to participate in these ceremonies and manage local community currencies. 

Referendums marking key Encointer adoption milestones include: 

- [**Referendum 158 - Register Encointer As a Common Good Chain**](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/158){target=\_blank} - registered Encointer as the second system parachain on Kusama's network
- [**Referendum 187 - Encointer Runtime Upgrade to Full Functionality**](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/187){target=\_blank} - introduced a runtime upgrade bringing governance and full functionality for communities to use the protocol

To learn more about Encointer, see the official [Encointer book](https://book.encointer.org/introduction.html){target=\_blank} or watch an [Encointer ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcgpCCYBqko){target=\_blank} in action.

# Accounts

## Introduction

Accounts are essential for managing identity, transactions, and governance on the network in the Polkadot SDK. Understanding these components is critical for seamless development and operation on the network, whether you're building or interacting with Polkadot-based chains.

This page will guide you through the essential aspects of accounts, including their data structure, balance types, reference counters, and address formats. You’ll learn how accounts are managed within the runtime, how balances are categorized, and how addresses are encoded and validated. 

## Account Data Structure

Accounts are foundational to any blockchain, and the Polkadot SDK provides a flexible management system. This section explains how the Polkadot SDK defines accounts and manages their lifecycle through data structures within the runtime.

### Account

The [`Account` data type](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/type.Account.html){target=\_blank} is a storage map within the [System pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/src/frame_system/lib.rs.html){target=\_blank} that links an account ID to its corresponding data. This structure is fundamental for mapping account-related information within the chain.

The code snippet below shows how accounts are defined:

```rs
 /// The full account information for a particular account ID.
	#[pallet::storage]
	#[pallet::getter(fn account)]
	pub type Account<T: Config> = StorageMap<
		_,
		Blake2_128Concat,
		T::AccountId,
		AccountInfo<T::Nonce, T::AccountData>,
		ValueQuery,
	>;
```

The preceding code block defines a storage map named `Account`. The `StorageMap` is a type of on-chain storage that maps keys to values. In the `Account` map, the key is an account ID, and the value is the account's information. Here, `T` represents the generic parameter for the runtime configuration, which is defined by the pallet's configuration trait (`Config`).

The `StorageMap` consists of the following parameters:

- **`_`** - used in macro expansion and acts as a placeholder for the storage prefix type. Tells the macro to insert the default prefix during expansion
- **`Blake2_128Concat`** - the hashing function applied to keys in the storage map
- **`T::AccountId`** - represents the key type, which corresponds to the account’s unique ID
- **`AccountInfo<T::Nonce, T::AccountData>`** - the value type stored in the map. For each account ID, the map stores an `AccountInfo` struct containing:
    - **`T::Nonce`** - a nonce for the account, which is incremented with each transaction to ensure transaction uniqueness
    - **`T::AccountData`** - custom account data defined by the runtime configuration, which could include balances, locked funds, or other relevant information
- **`ValueQuery`** - defines how queries to the storage map behave when no value is found; returns a default value instead of `None`

For a detailed explanation of storage maps, see the [`StorageMap`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageMap.html){target=\_blank} entry in the Rust docs.

### Account Info

The `AccountInfo` structure is another key element within the [System pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/src/frame_system/lib.rs.html){target=\_blank}, providing more granular details about each account's state. This structure tracks vital data, such as the number of transactions and the account’s relationships with other modules.

```rs
/// Information of an account.
#[derive(Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Default, RuntimeDebug, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, MaxEncodedLen)]
pub struct AccountInfo<Nonce, AccountData> {
	/// The number of transactions this account has sent.
	pub nonce: Nonce,
	/// The number of other modules that currently depend on this account's existence. The account
	/// cannot be reaped until this is zero.
	pub consumers: RefCount,
	/// The number of other modules that allow this account to exist. The account may not be reaped
	/// until this and `sufficients` are both zero.
	pub providers: RefCount,
	/// The number of modules that allow this account to exist for their own purposes only. The
	/// account may not be reaped until this and `providers` are both zero.
	pub sufficients: RefCount,
	/// The additional data that belongs to this account. Used to store the balance(s) in a lot of
	/// chains.
	pub data: AccountData,
}
```

The `AccountInfo` structure includes the following components:

- **`nonce`** - tracks the number of transactions initiated by the account, which ensures transaction uniqueness and prevents replay attacks
- **`consumers`** - counts how many other modules or pallets rely on this account’s existence. The account cannot be removed from the chain (reaped) until this count reaches zero
- **`providers`** - tracks how many modules permit this account’s existence. An account can only be reaped once both `providers` and `sufficients` are zero
- **`sufficients`** - represents the number of modules that allow the account to exist for internal purposes, independent of any other modules
- **`AccountData`** - a flexible data structure that can be customized in the runtime configuration, usually containing balances or other user-specific data

This structure helps manage an account's state and prevents its premature removal while it is still referenced by other on-chain data or modules. The [`AccountInfo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/struct.AccountInfo.html){target=\_blank} structure can vary as long as it satisfies the trait bounds defined by the `AccountData` associated type in the [`frame-system::pallet::Config`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/trait.Config.html){target=\_blank} trait.

### Account Reference Counters

Polkadot SDK uses reference counters to track an account’s dependencies across different runtime modules. These counters ensure that accounts remain active while data is associated with them.

The reference counters include:

- **`consumers`** - prevents account removal while other pallets still rely on the account
- **`providers`** - ensures an account is active before other pallets store data related to it
- **`sufficients`** - indicates the account’s independence, ensuring it can exist even without a native token balance, such as when holding sufficient alternative assets

#### Providers Reference Counters

The `providers` counter ensures that an account is ready to be depended upon by other runtime modules. For example, it is incremented when an account has a balance above the existential deposit, which marks the account as active.

The system requires this reference counter to be greater than zero for the `consumers` counter to be incremented, ensuring the account is stable before any dependencies are added.

#### Consumers Reference Counters

The `consumers` counter ensures that the account cannot be reaped until all references to it across the runtime have been removed. This check prevents the accidental deletion of accounts that still have active on-chain data.

It is the user’s responsibility to clear out any data from other runtime modules if they wish to remove their account and reclaim their existential deposit.

#### Sufficients Reference Counter

The `sufficients` counter tracks accounts that can exist independently without relying on a native account balance. This is useful for accounts holding other types of assets, like tokens, without needing a minimum balance in the native token.

For instance, the [Assets pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_assets/index.html){target=\_blank}, may increment this counter for an account holding sufficient tokens.

#### Account Deactivation

In Polkadot SDK-based chains, an account is deactivated when its reference counters (such as `providers`, `consumers`, and `sufficient`) reach zero. These counters ensure the account remains active as long as other runtime modules or pallets reference it.

When all dependencies are cleared and the counters drop to zero, the account becomes deactivated and may be removed from the chain (reaped). This is particularly important in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, where accounts with balances below the existential deposit threshold are pruned from storage to conserve state resources.

Each pallet that references an account has cleanup functions that decrement these counters when the pallet no longer depends on the account. Once these counters reach zero, the account is marked for deactivation.

#### Updating Counters

The Polkadot SDK provides runtime developers with various methods to manage account lifecycle events, such as deactivation or incrementing reference counters. These methods ensure that accounts cannot be reaped while still in use.

The following helper functions manage these counters:

- **`inc_consumers()`** - increments the `consumer` reference counter for an account, signaling that another pallet depends on it
- **`dec_consumers()`** - decrements the `consumer` reference counter, signaling that a pallet no longer relies on the account
- **`inc_providers()`** - increments the `provider` reference counter, ensuring the account remains active
- **`dec_providers()`** - decrements the `provider` reference counter, allowing for account deactivation when no longer in use
- **`inc_sufficients()`** - increments the `sufficient` reference counter for accounts that hold sufficient assets
- **`dec_sufficients()`** - decrements the `sufficient` reference counter

To ensure proper account cleanup and lifecycle management, a corresponding decrement should be made for each increment action.

The `System` pallet offers three query functions to assist developers in tracking account states:

- [**`can_inc_consumer()`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.can_inc_consumer){target=\_blank} - checks if the account can safely increment the consumer reference
- [**`can_dec_provider()`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.can_dec_provider){target=\_blank} - ensures that no consumers exist before allowing the decrement of the provider counter
- [**`is_provider_required()`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.is_provider_required){target=\_blank} - verifies whether the account still has any active consumer references

This modular and flexible system of reference counters tightly controls the lifecycle of accounts in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, preventing the accidental removal or retention of unneeded accounts. You can refer to the [System pallet Rust docs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank} for more details.
    

## Account Balance Types

In the Polkadot ecosystem, account balances are categorized into different types based on how the funds are utilized and their availability. These balance types determine the actions that can be performed, such as transferring tokens, paying transaction fees, or participating in governance activities. Understanding these balance types helps developers manage user accounts and implement balance-dependent logic.

!!! note "A more efficient distribution of account balance types is in development"
    Soon, pallets in the Polkadot SDK will implement the [`Fungible` trait](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/index.html){target=\_blank} (see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/226){target=\_blank} for more details). For example, the [`transaction-storage`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_transaction_storage/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet changed the implementation of the [`Currency`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/currency/index.html){target=\_blank} trait (see the [Refactor transaction storage pallet to use fungible traits](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1800){target=\_blank} PR for further details):

    ```rust
    type BalanceOf<T> = <<T as Config>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance;
    ```
    
    To the [`Fungible`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/index.html){target=\_blank} trait:

    ```rust
    type BalanceOf<T> = <<T as Config>::Currency as FnInspect<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance;
    ```
    
    This update will enable more efficient use of account balances, allowing the free balance to be utilized for on-chain activities such as setting proxies and managing identities.

### Balance Types

The five main balance types are:

- **Free balance** - represents the total tokens available to the account for any on-chain activity, including staking, governance, and voting. However, it may not be fully spendable or transferrable if portions of it are locked or reserved
- **Locked balance** - portions of the free balance that cannot be spent or transferred because they are tied up in specific activities like [staking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking#nominating-validators){target=\_blank}, [vesting](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-transfers#vested-transfers-with-the-polkadot-js-ui){target=\_blank}, or participating in [governance](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#voting-on-a-referendum){target=\_blank}. While the tokens remain part of the free balance, they are non-transferable for the duration of the lock
- **Reserved balance** - funds locked by specific system actions, such as setting up an [identity](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-identity){target=\_blank}, creating [proxies](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-proxies){target=\_blank}, or submitting [deposits for governance proposals](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-polkadot-opengov#claiming-opengov-deposits){target=\_blank}. These tokens are not part of the free balance and cannot be spent unless they are unreserved
- **Spendable balance** - the portion of the free balance that is available for immediate spending or transfers. It is calculated by subtracting the maximum of locked or reserved amounts from the free balance, ensuring that existential deposit limits are met
- **Untouchable balance** - funds that cannot be directly spent or transferred but may still be utilized for on-chain activities, such as governance participation or staking. These tokens are typically tied to certain actions or locked for a specific period

The spendable balance is calculated as follows:

```text
spendable = free - max(locked - reserved, ED)
```

Here, `free`, `locked`, and `reserved` are defined above. The `ED` represents the [existential deposit](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-accounts#existential-deposit-and-reaping){target=\_blank}, the minimum balance required to keep an account active and prevent it from being reaped. You may find you can't see all balance types when looking at your account via a wallet. Wallet providers often display only spendable, locked, and reserved balances.

### Locks

Locks are applied to an account's free balance, preventing that portion from being spent or transferred. Locks are automatically placed when an account participates in specific on-chain activities, such as staking or governance. Although multiple locks may be applied simultaneously, they do not stack. Instead, the largest lock determines the total amount of locked tokens.

Locks follow these basic rules:

- If different locks apply to varying amounts, the largest lock amount takes precedence
- If multiple locks apply to the same amount, the lock with the longest duration governs when the balance can be unlocked

#### Locks Example

Consider an example where an account has 80 DOT locked for both staking and governance purposes like so:

- 80 DOT is staked with a 28-day lock period
- 24 DOT is locked for governance with a 1x conviction and a 7-day lock period
- 4 DOT is locked for governance with a 6x conviction and a 224-day lock period

In this case, the total locked amount is 80 DOT because only the largest lock (80 DOT from staking) governs the locked balance. These 80 DOT will be released at different times based on the lock durations. In this example, the 24 DOT locked for governance will be released first since the shortest lock period is seven days. The 80 DOT stake with a 28-day lock period is released next. Now, all that remains locked is the 4 DOT for governance. After 224 days, all 80 DOT (minus the existential deposit) will be free and transferrable.

![Illustration of Lock Example](/images/polkadot-protocol/basics/accounts/locks-example-2.webp)

#### Edge Cases for Locks

In scenarios where multiple convictions and lock periods are active, the lock duration and amount are determined by the longest period and largest amount. For example, if you delegate with different convictions and attempt to undelegate during an active lock period, the lock may be extended for the full amount of tokens. For a detailed discussion on edge case lock behavior, see this [Stack Exchange post](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/5067/delegating-and-undelegating-during-the-lock-period-extends-it-for-the-initial-am){target=\_blank}.

### Balance Types on Polkadot.js

Polkadot.js provides a user-friendly interface for managing and visualizing various account balances on Polkadot and Kusama networks. When interacting with Polkadot.js, you will encounter multiple balance types that are critical for understanding how your funds are distributed and restricted. This section explains how different balances are displayed in the Polkadot.js UI and what each type represents.

![](/images/polkadot-protocol/basics/accounts/account-balance-types-1.webp)

The most common balance types displayed on Polkadot.js are:

- **Total balance** - the total number of tokens available in the account. This includes all tokens, whether they are transferable, locked, reserved, or vested. However, the total balance does not always reflect what can be spent immediately. In this example, the total balance is 0.6274 KSM

- **Transferrable balance** - shows how many tokens are immediately available for transfer. It is calculated by subtracting the locked and reserved balances from the total balance. For example, if an account has a total balance of 0.6274 KSM and a transferrable balance of 0.0106 KSM, only the latter amount can be sent or spent freely

- **Vested balance** - tokens that allocated to the account but released according to a specific schedule. Vested tokens remain locked and cannot be transferred until fully vested. For example, an account with a vested balance of 0.2500 KSM means that this amount is owned but not yet transferable

- **Locked balance** - tokens that are temporarily restricted from being transferred or spent. These locks typically result from participating in staking, governance, or vested transfers. In Polkadot.js, locked balances do not stack—only the largest lock is applied. For instance, if an account has 0.5500 KSM locked for governance and staking, the locked balance would display 0.5500 KSM, not the sum of all locked amounts

- **Reserved balance** - refers to tokens locked for specific on-chain actions, such as setting an identity, creating a proxy, or making governance deposits. Reserved tokens are not part of the free balance, but can be freed by performing certain actions. For example, removing an identity would unreserve those funds

- **Bonded balance** - the tokens locked for staking purposes. Bonded tokens are not transferrable until they are unbonded after the unbonding period

- **Redeemable balance** - the number of tokens that have completed the unbonding period and are ready to be unlocked and transferred again. For example, if an account has a redeemable balance of 0.1000 KSM, those tokens are now available for spending

- **Democracy balance** - reflects the number of tokens locked for governance activities, such as voting on referenda. These tokens are locked for the duration of the governance action and are only released after the lock period ends

By understanding these balance types and their implications, developers and users can better manage their funds and engage with on-chain activities more effectively.

## Address Formats

The SS58 address format is a core component of the Polkadot SDK that enables accounts to be uniquely identified across Polkadot-based networks. This format is a modified version of Bitcoin's Base58Check encoding, specifically designed to accommodate the multi-chain nature of the Polkadot ecosystem. SS58 encoding allows each chain to define its own set of addresses while maintaining compatibility and checksum validation for security. 

### Basic Format

SS58 addresses consist of three main components:

```text
base58encode(concat(<address-type>, <address>, <checksum>))
```

- **Address type** - a byte or set of bytes that define the network (or chain) for which the address is intended. This ensures that addresses are unique across different Polkadot SDK-based chains
- **Address** - the public key of the account encoded as bytes
- **Checksum** - a hash-based checksum which ensures that addresses are valid and unaltered. The checksum is derived from the concatenated address type and address components, ensuring integrity

The encoding process transforms the concatenated components into a Base58 string, providing a compact and human-readable format that avoids easily confused characters (e.g., zero '0', capital 'O', lowercase 'l'). This encoding function ([`encode`](https://docs.rs/bs58/latest/bs58/fn.encode.html){target=\_blank}) is implemented exactly as defined in Bitcoin and IPFS specifications, using the same alphabet as both implementations.

For more details about the SS58 address format implementation, see the [`Ss58Codec`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_core/crypto/trait.Ss58Codec.html){target=\_blank} trait in the Rust Docs.

### Address Type

The address type defines how an address is interpreted and to which network it belongs. Polkadot SDK uses different prefixes to distinguish between various chains and address formats:

- **Address types `0-63`** - simple addresses, commonly used for network identifiers
- **Address types `64-127`** - full addresses that support a wider range of network identifiers
- **Address types `128-255`** - reserved for future address format extensions

For example, Polkadot’s main network uses an address type of 0, while Kusama uses 2. This ensures that addresses can be used without confusion between networks.

The address type is always encoded as part of the SS58 address, making it easy to quickly identify the network. Refer to the [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry){target=\_blank} for the canonical listing of all address type identifiers and how they map to Polkadot SDK-based networks.

### Address Length

SS58 addresses can have different lengths depending on the specific format. Address lengths range from as short as 3 to 35 bytes, depending on the complexity of the address and network requirements. This flexibility allows SS58 addresses to adapt to different chains while providing a secure encoding mechanism.

| Total | Type | Raw account | Checksum |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| 3     | 1    | 1           | 1        |
| 4     | 1    | 2           | 1        |
| 5     | 1    | 2           | 2        |
| 6     | 1    | 4           | 1        |
| 7     | 1    | 4           | 2        |
| 8     | 1    | 4           | 3        |
| 9     | 1    | 4           | 4        |
| 10    | 1    | 8           | 1        |
| 11    | 1    | 8           | 2        |
| 12    | 1    | 8           | 3        |
| 13    | 1    | 8           | 4        |
| 14    | 1    | 8           | 5        |
| 15    | 1    | 8           | 6        |
| 16    | 1    | 8           | 7        |
| 17    | 1    | 8           | 8        |
| 35    | 1    | 32          | 2        |

SS58 addresses also support different payload sizes, allowing a flexible range of account identifiers.

### Checksum Types

A checksum is applied to validate SS58 addresses. Polkadot SDK uses a Blake2b-512 hash function to calculate the checksum, which is appended to the address before encoding. The checksum length can vary depending on the address format (e.g., 1-byte, 2-byte, or longer), providing varying levels of validation strength.

The checksum ensures that an address is not modified or corrupted, adding an extra layer of security for account management.

### Validating Addresses

SS58 addresses can be validated using the subkey command-line interface or the Polkadot.js API. These tools help ensure an address is correctly formatted and valid for the intended network. The following sections will provide an overview of how validation works with these tools.

#### Using Subkey

[Subkey](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/subkey/index.html){target=\_blank} is a CLI tool provided by Polkadot SDK for generating and managing keys. It can inspect and validate SS58 addresses.

The `inspect` command gets a public key and an SS58 address from the provided secret URI. The basic syntax for the `subkey inspect` command is:

```bash
subkey inspect [flags] [options] uri
```

For the `uri` command-line argument, you can specify the secret seed phrase, a hex-encoded private key, or an SS58 address. If the input is a valid address, the `subkey` program displays the corresponding hex-encoded public key, account identifier, and SS58 addresses.

For example, to inspect the public keys derived from a secret seed phrase, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
subkey inspect "caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very"
```

The command displays output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>subkey inspect "caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very"</span>

The `subkey` program assumes an address is based on a public/private key pair. If you inspect an address, the command returns the 32-byte account identifier.

However, not all addresses in Polkadot SDK-based networks are based on keys.

Depending on the command-line options you specify and the input you provided, the command output might also display the network for which the address has been encoded. For example:

```bash
subkey inspect "12bzRJfh7arnnfPPUZHeJUaE62QLEwhK48QnH9LXeK2m1iZU"
```

The command displays output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal markdown>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>subkey inspect "12bzRJfh7arnnfPPUZHeJUaE62QLEwhK48QnH9LXeK2m1iZU"</span>

</div>

#### Using Polkadot.js API

To verify an address in JavaScript or TypeScript projects, you can use the functions built into the [Polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/){target=\_blank}. For example:

```js
// Import Polkadot.js API dependencies
const { decodeAddress, encodeAddress } = require('@polkadot/keyring');
const { hexToU8a, isHex } = require('@polkadot/util');

// Specify an address to test.
const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO_TEST';

// Check address
const isValidSubstrateAddress = () => {
  try {
    encodeAddress(isHex(address) ? hexToU8a(address) : decodeAddress(address));

    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    return false;
  }
};

// Query result
const isValid = isValidSubstrateAddress();
console.log(isValid);
```

If the function returns `true`, the specified address is a valid address.

#### Other SS58 Implementations

Support for encoding and decoding Polkadot SDK SS58 addresses has been implemented in several other languages and libraries.

# Blocks

## Introduction

In the Polkadot SDK, blocks are fundamental to the functioning of the blockchain, serving as containers for [transactions](/polkadot-protocol/basics/blocks-transactions-fees/transactions/){target=\_blank} and changes to the chain's state. Blocks consist of headers and an array of transactions, ensuring the integrity and validity of operations on the network. This guide explores the essential components of a block, the process of block production, and how blocks are validated and imported across the network. By understanding these concepts, developers can better grasp how blockchains maintain security, consistency, and performance within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## What is a Block?

In the Polkadot SDK, a block is a fundamental unit that encapsulates both the header and an array of transactions. The block header includes critical metadata to ensure the integrity and sequence of the blockchain. Here's a breakdown of its components:

- **Block height** - indicates the number of blocks created in the chain so far
- **Parent hash** - the hash of the previous block, providing a link to maintain the blockchain's immutability
- **Transaction root** - cryptographic digest summarizing all transactions in the block
- **State root** - a cryptographic digest representing the post-execution state
- **Digest** - additional information that can be attached to a block, such as consensus-related messages

Each transaction is part of a series that is executed according to the runtime's rules. The transaction root is a cryptographic digest of this series, which prevents alterations and enables succinct verification by light clients. This verification process allows light clients to confirm whether a transaction exists in a block with only the block header, avoiding downloading the entire block.

## Block Production

When an authoring node is authorized to create a new block, it selects transactions from the transaction queue based on priority. This step, known as block production, relies heavily on the executive module to manage the initialization and finalization of blocks. The process is summarized as follows:

### Initialize Block

The block initialization process begins with a series of function calls that prepare the block for transaction execution:

1. **Call `on_initialize`** - the executive module calls the [`on_initialize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_initialize){target=\_blank} hook from the system pallet and other runtime pallets to prepare for the block's transactions
2. **Coordinate runtime calls** - coordinates function calls in the order defined by the transaction queue
3. **Verify information** - once [`on_initialize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_initialize){target=\_blank} functions are executed, the executive module checks the parent hash in the block header and the trie root to verify information is consistent

### Finalize Block

Once transactions are processed, the block must be finalized before being broadcast to the network. The finalization steps are as follows:

1. -**Call `on_finalize`** - the executive module calls the [`on_finalize`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_finalize){target=\_blank} hooks in each pallet to ensure any remaining state updates or checks are completed before the block is sealed and published 
2. -**Verify information** - the block's digest and storage root in the header are checked against the initialized block to ensure consistency
3. -**Call `on_idle`** - the [`on_idle`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_idle){target=\_blank} hook is triggered to process any remaining tasks using the leftover weight from the block

## Block Authoring and Import

Once the block is finalized, it is gossiped to other nodes in the network. Nodes follow this procedure:

1. **Receive transactions** - the authoring node collects transactions from the network
2. **Validate** - transactions are checked for validity
3. **Queue** - valid transactions are placed in the transaction pool for execution
4. **Execute** - state changes are made as the transactions are executed
5. **Publish** - the finalized block is broadcast to the network

### Block Import Queue

After a block is published, other nodes on the network can import it into their chain state. The block import queue is part of the outer node in every Polkadot SDK-based node and ensures incoming blocks are valid before adding them to the node's state.

In most cases, you don't need to know details about how transactions are gossiped or how other nodes on the network import blocks. The following traits are relevant, however, if you plan to write any custom consensus logic or want a deeper dive into the block import queue:

- [**`ImportQueue`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/trait.ImportQueue.html){target=\_blank} - the trait that defines the block import queue
- [**`Link`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/trait.Link.html){target=\_blank} - the trait that defines the link between the block import queue and the network
- [**`BasicQueue`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/struct.BasicQueue.html){target=\_blank} - a basic implementation of the block import queue
- [**`Verifier`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/import_queue/trait.Verifier.html){target=\_blank} - the trait that defines the block verifier
- [**`BlockImport`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/block_import/trait.BlockImport.html){target=\_blank} - the trait that defines the block import process

These traits govern how blocks are validated and imported across the network, ensuring consistency and security.

# Transactions Weights and Fees

## Introductions

When transactions are executed, or data is stored on-chain, the activity changes the chain's state and consumes blockchain resources. Because the resources available to a blockchain are limited, managing how operations on-chain consume them is important. In addition to being limited in practical terms, such as storage capacity, blockchain resources represent a potential attack vector for malicious users. For example, a malicious user might attempt to overload the network with messages to stop the network from producing new blocks. To protect blockchain resources from being drained or overloaded, you need to manage how they are made available and how they are consumed. The resources to be aware of include:

- Memory usage
- Storage input and output
- Computation
- Transaction and block size
- State database size

The Polkadot SDK provides block authors with several ways to manage access to resources and to prevent individual components of the chain from consuming too much of any single resource. Two of the most important mechanisms available to block authors are weights and transaction fees.

[Weights](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight){target=\_blank} manage the time it takes to validate a block and characterize the time it takes to execute the calls in the block's body. By controlling the execution time a block can consume, weights set limits on storage input, output, and computation.

Some of the weight allowed for a block is consumed as part of the block's initialization and finalization. The weight might also be used to execute mandatory inherent extrinsic calls. To help ensure blocks don’t consume too much execution time and prevent malicious users from overloading the system with unnecessary calls, weights are combined with transaction fees.

[Transaction fees](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-transactions#transaction-fees){target=\_blank} provide an economic incentive to limit execution time, computation, and the number of calls required to perform operations. Transaction fees are also used to make the blockchain economically sustainable because they are typically applied to transactions initiated by users and deducted before a transaction request is executed.

## How Fees are Calculated

The final fee for a transaction is calculated using the following parameters:

- **`base fee`** - this is the minimum amount a user pays for a transaction. It is declared a base weight in the runtime and converted to a fee using the [`WeightToFee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.WeightToFee){target=\_blank} conversion
- **`weight fee`** - a fee proportional to the execution time (input and output and computation) that a transaction consumes
- **`length fee`** - a fee proportional to the encoded length of the transaction
- **`tip`** - an optional tip to increase the transaction’s priority, giving it a higher chance to be included in the transaction queue

The base fee and proportional weight and length fees constitute the inclusion fee. The inclusion fee is the minimum fee that must be available for a transaction to be included in a block.

```text
inclusion fee = base fee + weight fee + length fee
```

Transaction fees are withdrawn before the transaction is executed. After the transaction is executed, the weight can be adjusted to reflect the resources used. If a transaction uses fewer resources than expected, the transaction fee is corrected, and the adjusted transaction fee is deposited.

## Using the Transaction Payment Pallet

The [Transaction Payment pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame/transaction-payment){target=\_blank} provides the basic logic for calculating the inclusion fee. You can also use the Transaction Payment pallet to:

- Convert a weight value into a deductible fee based on a currency type using [`Config::WeightToFee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.WeightToFee){target=\_blank}
- Update the fee for the next block by defining a multiplier based on the chain’s final state at the end of the previous block using [`Config::FeeMultiplierUpdate`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.FeeMultiplierUpdate){target=\_blank}
- Manage the withdrawal, refund, and deposit of transaction fees using [`Config::OnChargeTransaction`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.OnChargeTransaction){target=\_blank}

You can learn more about these configuration traits in the [Transaction Payment documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_transaction_payment/index.html){target=\_blank}.

### Understanding the Inclusion Fee

The formula for calculating the inclusion fee is as follows:

```text
inclusion_fee = base_fee + length_fee + [targeted_fee_adjustment * weight_fee]
```

And then, for calculating the final fee:

```text
final_fee = inclusion_fee + tip
```

In the first formula, the `targeted_fee_adjustment` is a multiplier that can tune the final fee based on the network’s congestion.

- The `base_fee` derived from the base weight covers inclusion overhead like signature verification
- The `length_fee` is a per-byte fee that is multiplied by the length of the encoded extrinsic
- The `weight_fee` fee is calculated using two parameters:
  - The `ExtrinsicBaseWeight` that is declared in the runtime and applies to all extrinsics
  - The `#[pallet::weight]` annotation that accounts for an extrinsic's complexity

To convert the weight to `Currency`, the runtime must define a `WeightToFee` struct that implements a conversion function, [`Convert<Weight,Balance>`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.weight_to_fee){target=\_blank}.

Note that the extrinsic sender is charged the inclusion fee before the extrinsic is invoked. The fee is deducted from the sender's balance even if the transaction fails upon execution.

### Accounts with an Insufficient Balance

If an account does not have a sufficient balance to pay the inclusion fee and remain alive—that is, enough to pay the inclusion fee and maintain the minimum existential deposit—then you should ensure the transaction is canceled so that no fee is deducted and the transaction does not begin execution.

The Polkadot SDK doesn't enforce this rollback behavior. However, this scenario would be rare because the transaction queue and block-making logic perform checks to prevent it before adding an extrinsic to a block.

### Fee Multipliers

The inclusion fee formula always results in the same fee for the same input. However, weight can be dynamic and—based on how [`WeightToFee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.WeightToFee){target=\_blank} is defined—the final fee can include some degree of variability.
The Transaction Payment pallet provides the [`FeeMultiplierUpdate`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.FeeMultiplierUpdate){target=\_blank} configurable parameter to account for this variability.

The Polkadot network inspires the default update function and implements a targeted adjustment in which a target saturation level of block weight is defined. If the previous block is more saturated, the fees increase slightly. Similarly, if the last block has fewer transactions than the target, fees are decreased by a small amount. For more information about fee multiplier adjustments, see the [Web3 Research Page](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/overview/token-economics#relay-chain-transaction-fees-and-per-block-transaction-limits){target=\_blank}.

## Transactions with Special Requirements

Inclusion fees must be computable before execution and can only represent fixed logic. Some transactions warrant limiting resources with other strategies. For example:

- Bonds are a type of fee that might be returned or slashed after some on-chain event. For example, you might want to require users to place a bond to participate in a vote. The bond might then be returned at the end of the referendum or slashed if the voter attempted malicious behavior
- Deposits are fees that might be returned later. For example, you might require users to pay a deposit to execute an operation that uses storage. The user’s deposit could be returned if a subsequent operation frees up storage
- Burn operations are used to pay for a transaction based on its internal logic. For example, a transaction might burn funds from the sender if the transaction creates new storage items to pay for the increased state size
- Limits enable you to enforce constant or configurable limits on specific operations. For example, the default [Staking pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame/staking){target=\_blank} only allows nominators to nominate 16 validators to limit the complexity of the validator election process

It is important to note that if you query the chain for a transaction fee, it only returns the inclusion fee.

## Default Weight Annotations

All dispatchable functions in the Polkadot SDK must specify a weight. The way of doing that is using the annotation-based system that lets you combine fixed values for database read/write weight and/or fixed values based on benchmarks. The most basic example would look like this:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(100_000)]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

Note that the [`ExtrinsicBaseWeight`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/constants/struct.ExtrinsicBaseWeight.html){target=\_blank} is automatically added to the declared weight to account for the costs of simply including an empty extrinsic into a block.

### Weights and Database Read/Write Operations

To make weight annotations independent of the deployed database backend, they are defined as a constant and then used in the annotations when expressing database accesses performed by the dispatchable:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(T::DbWeight::get().reads_writes(1, 2) + 20_000)]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

This dispatchable allows one database to read and two to write, in addition to other things that add the additional 20,000. Database access is generally every time a value declared inside the [`#[pallet::storage]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/pallet_macros/attr.storage.html){target=\_blank} block is accessed. However, unique accesses are counted because after a value is accessed, it is cached, and reaccessing it does not result in a database operation. That is:

- Multiple reads of the exact value count as one read
- Multiple writes of the exact value count as one write
- Multiple reads of the same value, followed by a write to that value, count as one read and one write
- A write followed by a read-only counts as one write

### Dispatch Classes

Dispatches are broken into three classes:

- Normal
- Operational
- Mandatory

If a dispatch is not defined as `Operational` or `Mandatory` in the weight annotation, the dispatch is identified as `Normal` by default. You can specify that the dispatchable uses another class like this:

```rust
#[pallet::dispatch((DispatchClass::Operational))]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

This tuple notation also allows you to specify a final argument determining whether the user is charged based on the annotated weight. If you don't specify otherwise, `Pays::Yes` is assumed:

```rust
#[pallet::dispatch(DispatchClass::Normal, Pays::No)]
fn my_dispatchable() {
    // ...
}
```

#### Normal Dispatches

Dispatches in this class represent normal user-triggered transactions. These types of dispatches only consume a portion of a block's total weight limit. For information about the maximum portion of a block that can be consumed for normal dispatches, see [`AvailableBlockRatio`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/limits/struct.BlockLength.html){target=\_blank}. Normal dispatches are sent to the transaction pool.

#### Operational Dispatches

Unlike normal dispatches, which represent the usage of network capabilities, operational dispatches are those that provide network capabilities. Operational dispatches can consume the entire weight limit of a block. They are not bound by the [`AvailableBlockRatio`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/limits/struct.BlockLength.html){target=\_blank}. Dispatches in this class are given maximum priority and are exempt from paying the [`length_fee`](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment/){target=\_blank}.

#### Mandatory Dispatches

Mandatory dispatches are included in a block even if they cause the block to surpass its weight limit. You can only use the mandatory dispatch class for inherent transactions that the block author submits. This dispatch class is intended to represent functions in the block validation process. Because these dispatches are always included in a block regardless of the function weight, the validation process must prevent malicious nodes from abusing the function to craft valid but impossibly heavy blocks. You can typically accomplish this by ensuring that:

- The operation performed is always light
- The operation can only be included in a block once

To make it more difficult for malicious nodes to abuse mandatory dispatches, they cannot be included in blocks that return errors. This dispatch class serves the assumption that it is better to allow an overweight block to be created than not to allow any block to be created at all.

### Dynamic Weights

In addition to purely fixed weights and constants, the weight calculation can consider the input arguments of a dispatchable. The weight should be trivially computable from the input arguments with some basic arithmetic:

```rust
use frame_support:: {
    dispatch:: {
        DispatchClass::Normal,
        Pays::Yes,
    },
   weights::Weight,
};

#[pallet::weight(FunctionOf(
  |args: (&Vec<User>,)| args.0.len().saturating_mul(10_000),
  )
]
fn handle_users(origin, calls: Vec<User>) {
    // Do something per user
}
```

## Post Dispatch Weight Correction

Depending on the execution logic, a dispatchable function might consume less weight than was prescribed pre-dispatch. To correct weight, the function declares a different return type and returns its actual weight:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(10_000 + 500_000_000)]
fn expensive_or_cheap(input: u64) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let was_heavy = do_calculation(input);

    if (was_heavy) {
        // None means "no correction" from the weight annotation.
        Ok(None.into())
    } else {
        // Return the actual weight consumed.
        Ok(Some(10_000).into())
    }
}
```

## Custom Fees

You can also define custom fee systems through custom weight functions or inclusion fee functions.

### Custom Weights

Instead of using the default weight annotations, you can create a custom weight calculation type using the weights module. The custom weight calculation type must implement the following traits:

- [`WeighData<T>`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/trait.WeighData.html){target=\_blank} to determine the weight of the dispatch
- [`ClassifyDispatch<T>`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/trait.ClassifyDispatch.html){target=\_blank} to determine the class of the dispatch
- [`PaysFee<T>`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/weights/trait.PaysFee.html){target=\_blank} to determine whether the sender of the dispatch pays fees
 
The Polkadot SDK then bundles the output information of the three traits into the [`DispatchInfo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/dispatch/struct.DispatchInfo.html){target=\_blank} struct and provides it by implementing the [`GetDispatchInfo`](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/dispatch/trait.GetDispatchInfo.html){target=\_blank} for all `Call` variants and opaque extrinsic types. This is used internally by the System and Executive modules.

`ClassifyDispatch`, `WeighData`, and `PaysFee` are generic over T, which gets resolved into the tuple of all dispatch arguments except for the origin. The following example illustrates a struct that calculates the weight as `m * len(args)`, where `m` is a given multiplier and args is the concatenated tuple of all dispatch arguments. In this example, the dispatch class is `Operational` if the transaction has more than 100 bytes of length in arguments and will pay fees if the encoded length exceeds 10 bytes.

```rust
struct LenWeight(u32);
impl<T> WeighData<T> for LenWeight {
    fn weigh_data(&self, target: T) -> Weight {
        let multiplier = self.0;
        let encoded_len = target.encode().len() as u32;
        multiplier * encoded_len
    }
}

impl<T> ClassifyDispatch<T> for LenWeight {
    fn classify_dispatch(&self, target: T) -> DispatchClass {
        let encoded_len = target.encode().len() as u32;
        if encoded_len > 100 {
            DispatchClass::Operational
        } else {
            DispatchClass::Normal
        }
    }
}

impl<T> PaysFee<T> {
    fn pays_fee(&self, target: T) -> Pays {
        let encoded_len = target.encode().len() as u32;
        if encoded_len > 10 {
            Pays::Yes
        } else {
            Pays::No
        }
    }
}
```

A weight calculator function can also be coerced to the final type of the argument instead of defining it as a vague type that can be encoded. The code would roughly look like this:

```rust
struct CustomWeight;
impl WeighData<(&u32, &u64)> for CustomWeight {
    fn weigh_data(&self, target: (&u32, &u64)) -> Weight {
        ...
    }
}

// given a dispatch:
#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config<I>, I: 'static> Pallet<T, I> {
    #[pallet::weight(CustomWeight)]
    fn foo(a: u32, b: u64) { ... }
}
```

In this example, the `CustomWeight` can only be used in conjunction with a dispatch with a particular signature `(u32, u64)`, as opposed to `LenWeight`, which can be used with anything because there aren't any assumptions about `<T>`.

#### Custom Inclusion Fee

The following example illustrates how to customize your inclusion fee. You must configure the appropriate associated types in the respective module.

```rust
// Assume this is the balance type
type Balance = u64;

// Assume we want all the weights to have a `100 + 2 * w` conversion to fees
struct CustomWeightToFee;
impl WeightToFee<Weight, Balance> for CustomWeightToFee {
    fn convert(w: Weight) -> Balance {
        let a = Balance::from(100);
        let b = Balance::from(2);
        let w = Balance::from(w);
        a + b * w
    }
}

parameter_types! {
    pub const ExtrinsicBaseWeight: Weight = 10_000_000;
}

impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {
    type ExtrinsicBaseWeight = ExtrinsicBaseWeight;
}

parameter_types! {
    pub const TransactionByteFee: Balance = 10;
}

impl transaction_payment::Config {
    type TransactionByteFee = TransactionByteFee;
    type WeightToFee = CustomWeightToFee;

        // Don't change anything. Put any fee update info here.
        multiplier

# Transactions

## Introduction

Transactions are essential components of blockchain networks, enabling state changes and the execution of key operations. In the Polkadot SDK, transactions, often called extrinsics, come in multiple forms, including signed, unsigned, and inherent transactions.

This guide walks you through the different transaction types and how they're formatted, validated, and processed within the Polkadot ecosystem. You'll also learn how to customize transaction formats and construct transactions for FRAME-based runtimes, ensuring a complete understanding of how transactions are built and executed in Polkadot SDK-based chains.

## What Is a Transaction?

In the Polkadot SDK, transactions represent operations that modify the chain's state, bundled into blocks for execution. The term extrinsic is often used to refer to any data that originates outside the runtime and is included in the chain. While other blockchain systems typically refer to these operations as "transactions," the Polkadot SDK adopts the broader term "extrinsic" to capture the wide variety of data types that can be added to a block.

There are three primary types of transactions (extrinsics) in the Polkadot SDK:

- **Signed transactions** - signed by the submitting account, often carrying transaction fees
- **Unsigned transactions** - submitted without a signature, often requiring custom validation logic
- **Inherent transactions** - typically inserted directly into blocks by block authoring nodes, without gossiping between peers

Each type serves a distinct purpose, and understanding when and how to use each is key to efficiently working with the Polkadot SDK.

### Signed Transactions

Signed transactions require an account's signature and typically involve submitting a request to execute a runtime call. The signature serves as a form of cryptographic proof that the sender has authorized the action, using their private key. These transactions often involve a transaction fee to cover the cost of execution and incentivize block producers.

Signed transactions are the most common type of transaction and are integral to user-driven actions, such as token transfers. For instance, when you transfer tokens from one account to another, the sending account must sign the transaction to authorize the operation.

For example, the [`pallet_balances::Call::transfer_allow_death`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.transfer_allow_death){target=\_blank} extrinsic in the Balances pallet allows you to transfer tokens. Since your account initiates this transaction, your account key is used to sign it. You'll also be responsible for paying the associated transaction fee, with the option to include an additional tip to incentivize faster inclusion in the block.

### Unsigned Transactions

Unsigned transactions do not require a signature or account-specific data from the sender. Unlike signed transactions, they do not come with any form of economic deterrent, such as fees, which makes them susceptible to spam or replay attacks. Custom validation logic must be implemented to mitigate these risks and ensure these transactions are secure.

Unsigned transactions typically involve scenarios where including a fee or signature is unnecessary or counterproductive. However, due to the absence of fees, they require careful validation to protect the network. For example, [`pallet_im_online::Call::heartbeat`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_im_online/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.heartbeat){target=\_blank} extrinsic allows validators to send a heartbeat signal, indicating they are active. Since only validators can make this call, the logic embedded in the transaction ensures that the sender is a validator, making the need for a signature or fee redundant.

Unsigned transactions are more resource-intensive than signed ones because custom validation is required, but they play a crucial role in certain operational scenarios, especially when regular user accounts aren't involved.

### Inherent Transactions

Inherent transactions are a specialized type of unsigned transaction that is used primarily for block authoring. Unlike signed or other unsigned transactions, inherent transactions are added directly by block producers and are not broadcasted to the network or stored in the transaction queue. They don't require signatures or the usual validation steps and are generally used to insert system-critical data directly into blocks.

A key example of an inherent transaction is inserting a timestamp into each block. The [`pallet_timestamp::Call::now`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_timestamp/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.now-1){target=\_blank} extrinsic allows block authors to include the current time in the block they are producing. Since the block producer adds this information, there is no need for transaction validation, like signature verification. The validation in this case is done indirectly by the validators, who check whether the timestamp is within an acceptable range before finalizing the block.

Another example is the [`paras_inherent::Call::enter`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/paras_inherent/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.enter){target=\_blank} extrinsic, which enables parachain collator nodes to send validation data to the relay chain. This inherent transaction ensures that the necessary parachain data is included in each block without the overhead of gossiped transactions.

Inherent transactions serve a critical role in block authoring by allowing important operational data to be added directly to the chain without needing the validation processes required for standard transactions.

## Transaction Formats

Understanding the structure of signed and unsigned transactions is crucial for developers building on Polkadot SDK-based chains. Whether you're optimizing transaction processing, customizing formats, or interacting with the transaction pool, knowing the format of extrinsics, Polkadot's term for transactions, is essential.

### Types of Transaction Formats

In Polkadot SDK-based chains, extrinsics can fall into three main categories:

- **Unchecked extrinsics** - typically used for signed transactions that require validation. They contain a signature and additional data, such as a nonce and information for fee calculation. Unchecked extrinsics are named as such because they require validation checks before being accepted into the transaction pool
- **Checked extrinsics** - typically used for inherent extrinsics (unsigned transactions); these don't require signature verification. Instead, they carry information such as where the extrinsic originates and any additional data required for the block authoring process
- **Opaque extrinsics** - used when the format of an extrinsic is not yet fully committed or finalized. They are still decodable, but their structure can be flexible depending on the context

### Signed Transaction Data Structure

A signed transaction typically includes the following components:

- **Signature** - verifies the authenticity of the transaction sender
- **Call** - the actual function or method call the transaction is requesting (for example, transferring funds)
- **Nonce** - tracks the number of prior transactions sent from the account, helping to prevent replay attacks
- **Tip** - an optional incentive to prioritize the transaction in block inclusion
- **Additional data** - includes details such as spec version, block hash, and genesis hash to ensure the transaction is valid within the correct runtime and chain context

Here's a simplified breakdown of how signed transactions are typically constructed in a Polkadot SDK runtime:

``` code
<signing account ID> + <signature> + <additional data>
```

Each part of the signed transaction has a purpose, ensuring the transaction's authenticity and context within the blockchain.

### Signed Extensions

Polkadot SDK also provides the concept of [signed extensions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/signed_extensions/index.html){target=\_blank}, which allow developers to extend extrinsics with additional data or validation logic before they are included in a block. The [`SignedExtension`](https://paritytech.github.io/try-runtime-cli/sp_runtime/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html){target=\_blank} set helps enforce custom rules or protections, such as ensuring the transaction's validity or calculating priority.

The transaction queue regularly calls signed extensions to verify a transaction's validity before placing it in the ready queue. This safeguard ensures transactions won't fail in a block. Signed extensions are commonly used to enforce validation logic and protect the transaction pool from spam and replay attacks.

In FRAME, a signed extension can hold any of the following types by default:

- [**`AccountId`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/runtime/types_common/type.AccountId.html){target=\_blank} - to encode the sender's identity
- [**`Call`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html#associatedtype.Call){target=\_blank} - to encode the pallet call to be dispatched. This data is used to calculate transaction fees
- [**`AdditionalSigned`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html#associatedtype.AdditionalSigned){target=\_blank} - to handle any additional data to go into the signed payload allowing you to attach any custom logic prior to dispatching a transaction
- [**`Pre`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_frame/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html#associatedtype.Pre){target=\_blank} - to encode the information that can be passed from before a call is dispatched to after it gets dispatched

Signed extensions can enforce checks like:

- [**`CheckSpecVersion`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/src/frame_system/extensions/check_spec_version.rs.html){target=\_blank} - ensures the transaction is compatible with the runtime's current version
- [**`CheckWeight`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/struct.CheckWeight.html){target=\_blank} - calculates the weight (or computational cost) of the transaction, ensuring the block doesn't exceed the maximum allowed weight

These extensions are critical in the transaction lifecycle, ensuring that only valid and prioritized transactions are processed.

## Transaction Construction

Building transactions in the Polkadot SDK involves constructing a payload that can be verified, signed, and submitted for inclusion in a block. Each runtime in the Polkadot SDK has its own rules for validating and executing transactions, but there are common patterns for constructing a signed transaction.

### Construct a Signed Transaction

A signed transaction in the Polkadot SDK includes various pieces of data to ensure security, prevent replay attacks, and prioritize processing. Here's an overview of how to construct one:

1. **Construct the unsigned payload** - gather the necessary information for the call, including:
    - **Pallet index** - identifies the pallet where the runtime function resides
    - **Function index** - specifies the particular function to call in the pallet
    - **Parameters** - any additional arguments required by the function call
2. **Create a signing payload** - once the unsigned payload is ready, additional data must be included:
    - **Transaction nonce** - unique identifier to prevent replay attacks
    - **Era information** - defines how long the transaction is valid before it's dropped from the pool
    - **Block hash** - ensures the transaction doesn't execute on the wrong chain or fork
3. **Sign the payload** - using the sender's private key, sign the payload to ensure that the transaction can only be executed by the account holder
4. **Serialize the signed payload** - once signed, the transaction must be serialized into a binary format, ensuring the data is compact and easy to transmit over the network
5. **Submit the serialized transaction** - finally, submit the serialized transaction to the network, where it will enter the transaction pool and wait for processing by an authoring node

The following is an example of how a signed transaction might look:

``` rust
node_runtime::UncheckedExtrinsic::new_signed(
    function.clone(),                                      // some call
    sp_runtime::AccountId32::from(sender.public()).into(), // some sending account
    node_runtime::Signature::Sr25519(signature.clone()),   // the account's signature
    extra.clone(),                                         // the signed extensions
)
```

### Transaction Encoding

Before a transaction is sent to the network, it is serialized and encoded using a structured encoding process that ensures consistency and prevents tampering:

- `[1]` - compact encoded length in bytes of the entire transaction
- `[2]` - a u8 containing 1 byte to indicate whether the transaction is signed or unsigned (1 bit) and the encoded transaction version ID (7 bits)
- `[3]` - if signed, this field contains an account ID, an SR25519 signature, and some extra data
- `[4]` - encoded call data, including pallet and function indices and any required arguments

This encoded format ensures consistency and efficiency in processing transactions across the network. By adhering to this format, applications can construct valid transactions and pass them to the network for execution.

To learn more about how compact encoding works using SCALE, see the [SCALE Codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} README on GitHub.

### Customize Transaction Construction

Although the basic steps for constructing transactions are consistent across Polkadot SDK-based chains, developers can customize transaction formats and validation rules. For example:

- **Custom pallets** - you can define new pallets with custom function calls, each with its own parameters and validation logic
- **Signed extensions** - developers can implement custom extensions that modify how transactions are prioritized, validated, or included in blocks

By leveraging Polkadot SDK's modular design, developers can create highly specialized transaction logic tailored to their chain's needs.

## Lifecycle of a Transaction

In the Polkadot SDK, transactions are often referred to as extrinsics because the data in transactions originates outside of the runtime. These transactions contain data that initiates changes to the chain state. The most common type of extrinsic is a signed transaction, which is cryptographically verified and typically incurs a fee. This section focuses on how signed transactions are processed, validated, and ultimately included in a block.

### Define Transaction Properties

The Polkadot SDK runtime defines key transaction properties, such as:

- **Transaction validity** - ensures the transaction meets all runtime requirements
- **Signed or unsigned** - identifies whether a transaction needs to be signed by an account
- **State changes** - determines how the transaction modifies the state of the chain

Pallets, which compose the runtime's logic, define the specific transactions that your chain supports. When a user submits a transaction, such as a token transfer, it becomes a signed transaction, verified by the user's account signature. If the account has enough funds to cover fees, the transaction is executed, and the chain's state is updated accordingly.

### Process on a Block Authoring Node

In Polkadot SDK-based networks, some nodes are authorized to author blocks. These nodes validate and process transactions. When a transaction is sent to a node that can produce blocks, it undergoes a lifecycle that involves several stages, including validation and execution. Non-authoring nodes gossip the transaction across the network until an authoring node receives it. The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a transaction that's submitted to a network and processed by an authoring node.

![Transaction lifecycle diagram](/images/polkadot-protocol/basics/blocks-transactions-fees/transactions/transaction-lifecycle-1.webp)

### Validate and Queue

Once a transaction reaches an authoring node, it undergoes an initial validation process to ensure it meets specific conditions defined in the runtime. This validation includes checks for:

- **Correct nonce** - ensures the transaction is sequentially valid for the account
- **Sufficient funds** - confirms the account can cover any associated transaction fees
- **Signature validity** - verifies that the sender's signature matches the transaction data

After these checks, valid transactions are placed in the transaction pool, where they are queued for inclusion in a block. The transaction pool regularly re-validates queued transactions to ensure they remain valid before being processed. To reach consensus, two-thirds of the nodes must agree on the order of the transactions executed and the resulting state change. Transactions are validated and queued on the local node in a transaction pool to prepare for consensus.

#### Transaction Pool

The transaction pool is responsible for managing valid transactions. It ensures that only transactions that pass initial validity checks are queued. Transactions that fail validation, expire, or become invalid for other reasons are removed from the pool.

The transaction pool organizes transactions into two queues:

- **Ready queue** - transactions that are valid and ready to be included in a block
- **Future queue** - transactions that are not yet valid but could be in the future, such as transactions with a nonce too high for the current state

Details on how the transaction pool validates transactions, including fee and signature handling, can be found in the [`validate_transaction`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_transaction_pool/runtime_api/trait.TaggedTransactionQueue.html#method.validate_transaction){target=\_blank} method.

#### Invalid Transactions

If a transaction is invalid, for example, due to an invalid signature or insufficient funds, it is rejected and won't be added to the block. Invalid transactions might be rejected for reasons such as:

- The transaction has already been included in a block
- The transaction's signature does not match the sender
- The transaction is too large to fit in the current block

### Transaction Ordering and Priority

When a node is selected as the next block author, it prioritizes transactions based on weight, length, and tip amount. The goal is to fill the block with high-priority transactions without exceeding its maximum size or computational limits. Transactions are ordered as follows:

- **Inherents first** - inherent transactions, such as block timestamp updates, are always placed first
- **Nonce-based ordering** - transactions from the same account are ordered by their nonce
- **Fee-based ordering** - among transactions with the same nonce or priority level, those with higher fees are prioritized

### Transaction Execution

Once a block author selects transactions from the pool, the transactions are executed in priority order. As each transaction is processed, the state changes are written directly to the chain's storage. It's important to note that these changes are not cached, meaning a failed transaction won't revert earlier state changes, which could leave the block in an inconsistent state.

Events are also written to storage. Runtime logic should not emit an event before performing the associated actions. If the associated transaction fails after the event was emitted, the event will not revert.

# Chain Data

## Introduction

Understanding and leveraging on-chain data is a fundamental aspect of blockchain development. Whether you're building frontend applications or backend systems, accessing and decoding runtime metadata is vital to interacting with the blockchain. This guide introduces you to the tools and processes for generating and retrieving metadata, explains its role in application development, and outlines the additional APIs available for interacting with a Polkadot node. By mastering these components, you can ensure seamless communication between your applications and the blockchain.

## Application Development

You might not be directly involved in building frontend applications as a blockchain developer. However, most applications that run on a blockchain require some form of frontend or user-facing client to enable users or other programs to access and modify the data that the blockchain stores. For example, you might develop a browser-based, mobile, or desktop application that allows users to submit transactions, post articles, view their assets, or track previous activity. The backend for that application is configured in the runtime logic for your blockchain, but the frontend client makes the runtime features accessible to your users.

For your custom chain to be useful to others, you'll need to provide a client application that allows users to view, interact with, or update information that the blockchain keeps track of. In this article, you'll learn how to expose information about your runtime so that client applications can use it, see examples of the information exposed, and explore tools and libraries that use it.

## Understand Metadata

Polkadot SDK-based blockchain networks are designed to expose their runtime information, allowing developers to learn granular details regarding pallets, RPC calls, and runtime APIs. The metadata also exposes their related documentation. The chain's metadata is [SCALE-encoded](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/){target=\_blank}, allowing for the development of browser-based, mobile, or desktop applications to support the chain's runtime upgrades seamlessly. It is also possible to develop applications compatible with multiple Polkadot SDK-based chains simultaneously.

## Expose Runtime Information as Metadata

To interact with a node or the state of the blockchain, you need to know how to connect to the chain and access the exposed runtime features. This interaction involves a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) through a node endpoint address, commonly through a secure web socket connection.

An application developer typically needs to know the contents of the runtime logic, including the following details:

- Version of the runtime the application is connecting to
- Supported APIs 
- Implemented pallets 
- Defined functions and corresponding type signatures
- Defined custom types 
- Exposed parameters users can set

As the Polkadot SDK is modular and provides a composable framework for building blockchains, there are limitless opportunities to customize the schema of properties. Each runtime can be configured with its properties, including function calls and types, which can be changed over time with runtime upgrades.

The Polkadot SDK enables you to generate the runtime metadata schema to capture information unique to a runtime. The metadata for a runtime describes the pallets in use and types defined for a specific runtime version. The metadata includes information about each pallet's storage items, functions, events, errors, and constants. The metadata also provides type definitions for any custom types included in the runtime.

Metadata provides a complete inventory of a chain's runtime. It is key to enabling client applications to interact with the node, parse responses, and correctly format message payloads sent back to that chain.

## Generate Metadata

To efficiently use the blockchain's networking resources and minimize the data transmitted over the network, the metadata schema is encoded using the [Parity SCALE Codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec?tab=readme-ov-file#parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank}. This encoding is done automatically through the [`scale-info`](https://docs.rs/scale-info/latest/scale_info/){target=\_blank}crate.

At a high level, generating the metadata involves the following steps:

1. The pallets in the runtime logic expose callable functions, types, parameters, and documentation that need to be encoded in the metadata
2. The `scale-info` crate collects type information for the pallets in the runtime, builds a registry of the pallets that exist in a particular runtime, and the relevant types for each pallet in the registry. The type information is detailed enough to enable encoding and decoding for every type
3. The [`frame-metadata`](https://github.com/paritytech/frame-metadata){target=\_blank} crate describes the structure of the runtime based on the registry provided by the `scale-info` crate
4. Nodes provide the RPC method `state_getMetadata` to return a complete description of all the types in the current runtime as a hex-encoded vector of SCALE-encoded bytes

## Retrieve Runtime Metadata

The type information provided by the metadata enables applications to communicate with nodes using different runtime versions and across chains that expose different calls, events, types, and storage items. The metadata also allows libraries to generate a substantial portion of the code needed to communicate with a given node, enabling libraries like [`subxt`](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt){target=\_blank} to generate frontend interfaces that are specific to a target chain.

### Use Polkadot.js

Visit the [Polkadot.js Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/rpc){target=\_blank} and select the **Developer** dropdown in the top banner. Select **RPC Calls** to make the call to request metadata. Follow these steps to make the RPC call:

1. Select **state** as the endpoint to call
2. Select **`getMetadata(at)`** as the method to call
3. Click **Submit RPC call** to submit the call and return the metadata in JSON format

### Use Curl 

You can fetch the metadata for the network by calling the node's RPC endpoint. This request returns the metadata in bytes rather than human-readable JSON:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getMetadata"}' \
https://rpc.polkadot.io

```

### Use Subxt

[`subxt`](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt){target=\_blank} may also be used to fetch the metadata of any data in a human-readable JSON format: 

```sh
subxt metadata  --url wss://rpc.polkadot.io --format json > spec.json
```

Another option is to use the [`subxt` explorer web UI](https://paritytech.github.io/subxt-explorer/#/){target=\_blank}.

## Client Applications and Metadata

The metadata exposes the expected way to decode each type, meaning applications can send, retrieve, and process application information without manual encoding and decoding. Client applications must use the [SCALE codec library](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec?tab=readme-ov-file#parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} to encode and decode RPC payloads to use the metadata. Client applications use the metadata to interact with the node, parse responses, and format message payloads sent to the node.

## Metadata Format

Although the SCALE-encoded bytes can be decoded using the `frame-metadata` and [`parity-scale-codec`](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} libraries, there are other tools, such as `subxt` and the Polkadot-JS API, that can convert the raw data to human-readable JSON format.

The types and type definitions included in the metadata returned by the `state_getMetadata` RPC call depend on the runtime's metadata version.

In general, the metadata includes the following information:

- A constant identifying the file as containing metadata
- The version of the metadata format used in the runtime
- Type definitions for all types used in the runtime and generated by the `scale-info` crate
- Pallet information for the pallets included in the runtime in the order that they are defined in the `construct_runtime` macro

!!!tip 
    Depending on the frontend library used (such as the [Polkadot API](https://papi.how/){target=\_blank}), they may format the metadata differently than the raw format shown.

The following example illustrates a condensed and annotated section of metadata decoded and converted to JSON:

```json
[
    1635018093,
    {
        "V14": {
            "types": {
                "types": [{}]
            },
            "pallets": [{}],
            "extrinsic": {
                "ty": 126,
                "version": 4,
                "signed_extensions": [{}]
            },
            "ty": 141
        }
    }
]
```

The constant `1635018093` is a magic number that identifies the file as a metadata file. The rest of the metadata is divided into the `types`, `pallets`, and `extrinsic` sections:

- The `types` section contains an index of the types and information about each type's type signature
- The `pallets` section contains information about each pallet in the runtime
- The `extrinsic` section describes the type identifier and transaction format version that the runtime uses

Different extrinsic versions can have varying formats, especially when considering [signed transactions](/polkadot-protocol/basics/blocks-transactions-fees/transactions/#signed-transactions){target=\_blank}. 

### Pallets

The following is a condensed and annotated example of metadata for a single element in the `pallets` array (the [`sudo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_sudo/index.html){target=\_blank} pallet):

```json

{
    "name": "Sudo",
    "storage": {
        "prefix": "Sudo",
        "entries": [
            {
                "name": "Key",
                "modifier": "Optional",
                "ty": {
                    "Plain": 0
                },
                "default": [0],
                "docs": ["The `AccountId` of the sudo key."]
            }
        ]
    },
    "calls": {
        "ty": 117
    },
    "event": {
        "ty": 42
    },
    "constants": [],
    "error": {
        "ty": 124
    },
    "index": 8
}

```

Every element metadata contains the name of the pallet it represents and information about its storage, calls, events, and errors. You can look up details about the definition of the calls, events, and errors by viewing the type index identifier. The type index identifier is the `u32` integer used to access the type information for that item. For example, the type index identifier for calls in the Sudo pallet is 117. If you view information for that type identifier in the `types` section of the metadata, it provides information about the available calls, including the documentation for each call.

For example, the following is a condensed excerpt of the calls for the Sudo pallet:

```json
{
    "id": 117,

                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For each field, you can access type information and metadata for the following:

- **Storage metadata** - provides the information required to enable applications to get information for specific storage items
- **Call metadata** - includes information about the runtime calls defined by the `#[pallet]` macro including call names, arguments and documentation
- **Event metadata** - provides the metadata generated by the `#[pallet::event]` macro, including the name, arguments, and documentation for each pallet event
- **Constants metadata** - provides metadata generated by the `#[pallet::constant]` macro, including the name, type, and hex-encoded value of the constant
- **Error metadata** - provides metadata generated by the `#[pallet::error]` macro, including the name and documentation for each pallet error

!!!tip
    Type identifiers change from time to time, so you should avoid relying on specific type identifiers in your applications.

### Extrinsic

The runtime generates extrinsic metadata and provides useful information about transaction format. When decoded, the metadata contains the transaction version and the list of signed extensions.

For example:

```json
{
    "extrinsic": {
        "ty": 126,
        "version": 4,
        "signed_extensions": [
            {
                "identifier": "CheckNonZeroSender",
                "ty": 132,
                "additional_signed": 41
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckSpecVersion",
                "ty": 133,
                "additional_signed": 4
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckTxVersion",
                "ty": 134,
                "additional_signed": 4
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckGenesis",
                "ty": 135,
                "additional_signed": 11
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckMortality",
                "ty": 136,
                "additional_signed": 11
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckNonce",
                "ty": 138,
                "additional_signed": 41
            },
            {
                "identifier": "CheckWeight",
                "ty": 139,
                "additional_signed": 41
            },
            {
                "identifier": "ChargeTransactionPayment",
                "ty": 140,
                "additional_signed": 41
            }
        ]
    },
    "ty": 141
}
```

The type system is [composite](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/frame_runtime_types/index.html){target=\_blank}, meaning each type identifier contains a reference to a specific type or to another type identifier that provides information about the associated primitive types.

For example, you can encode the `BitVec<Order, Store>` type, but to decode it properly, you must know the types used for the `Order` and `Store` types. To find type information for `Order` and `Store`, you can use the path in the decoded JSON to locate their type identifiers.

# Cryptography

## Introduction

Cryptography forms the backbone of blockchain technology, providing the mathematical verifiability crucial for consensus systems, data integrity, and user security. While a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical processes isn't necessary for most blockchain developers, grasping the fundamental applications of cryptography is essential. This page comprehensively overviews cryptographic implementations used across Polkadot SDK-based chains and the broader blockchain ecosystem.

## Hash Functions

Hash functions are fundamental to blockchain technology, creating a unique digital fingerprint for any piece of data, including simple text, images, or any other form of file. They map input data of any size to a fixed-size output (typically 32 bytes) using complex mathematical operations. Hashing is used to verify data integrity, create digital signatures, and provide a secure way to store passwords. This form of mapping is known as the ["pigeonhole principle,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle){target=\_blank} it is primarily implemented to efficiently and verifiably identify data from large sets.

### Key Properties of Hash Functions

- **Deterministic** - the same input always produces the same output
- **Quick computation** - it's easy to calculate the hash value for any given input
- **Pre-image resistance** - it's infeasible to generate the input data from its hash
- **Small changes in input yield large changes in output** - known as the ["avalanche effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect){target=\_blank}
- **Collision resistance** - the probabilities are extremely low to find two different inputs with the same hash

### Blake2

The Polkadot SDK utilizes Blake2, a state-of-the-art hashing method that offers:

- Equal or greater security compared to [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2){target=\_blank}
- Significantly faster performance than other algorithms

These properties make Blake2 ideal for blockchain systems, reducing sync times for new nodes and lowering the resources required for validation. For detailed technical specifications about Blake2, see the [official Blake2 paper](https://www.blake2.net/blake2.pdf){target=\_blank}.

## Types of Cryptography

There are two different ways that cryptographic algorithms are implemented: symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography.

### Symmetric Cryptography

Symmetric encryption is a branch of cryptography that isn't based on one-way functions, unlike asymmetric cryptography. It uses the same cryptographic key to encrypt plain text and decrypt the resulting ciphertext.

Symmetric cryptography is a type of encryption that has been used throughout history, such as the Enigma Cipher and the Caesar Cipher. It is still widely used today and can be found in Web2 and Web3 applications alike. There is only one single key, and a recipient must also have access to it to access the contained information.

#### Advantages {: #symmetric-advantages }

- Fast and efficient for large amounts of data
- Requires less computational power

#### Disadvantages {: #symmetric-disadvantages }

- Key distribution can be challenging
- Scalability issues in systems with many users

### Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric encryption is a type of cryptography that uses two different keys, known as a keypair: a public key, used to encrypt plain text, and a private counterpart, used to decrypt the ciphertext.

The public key encrypts a fixed-length message that can only be decrypted with the recipient's private key and, sometimes, a set password. The public key can be used to cryptographically verify that the corresponding private key was used to create a piece of data without compromising the private key, such as with digital signatures. This has obvious implications for identity, ownership, and properties and is used in many different protocols across Web2 and Web3.

#### Advantages {: #asymmetric-advantages }

- Solves the key distribution problem
- Enables digital signatures and secure key exchange

#### Disadvantages {: #asymmetric-disadvantages }

- Slower than symmetric encryption
- Requires more computational resources

### Trade-offs and Compromises

Symmetric cryptography is faster and requires fewer bits in the key to achieve the same level of security that asymmetric cryptography provides. However, it requires a shared secret before communication can occur, which poses issues to its integrity and a potential compromise point. On the other hand, asymmetric cryptography doesn't require the secret to be shared ahead of time, allowing for far better end-user security.

Hybrid symmetric and asymmetric cryptography is often used to overcome the engineering issues of asymmetric cryptography, as it is slower and requires more bits in the key to achieve the same level of security. It encrypts a key and then uses the comparatively lightweight symmetric cipher to do the "heavy lifting" with the message.

## Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are a way of verifying the authenticity of a document or message using asymmetric keypairs. They are used to ensure that a sender or signer's document or message hasn't been tampered with in transit, and for recipients to verify that the data is accurate and from the expected sender.

Signing digital signatures only requires a low-level understanding of mathematics and cryptography. For a conceptual example -- when signing a check, it is expected that it cannot be cashed multiple times. This isn't a feature of the signature system but rather the check serialization system. The bank will check that the serial number on the check hasn't already been used. Digital signatures essentially combine these two concepts, allowing the signature to provide the serialization via a unique cryptographic fingerprint that cannot be reproduced.

Unlike pen-and-paper signatures, knowledge of a digital signature cannot be used to create other signatures. Digital signatures are often used in bureaucratic processes, as they are more secure than simply scanning in a signature and pasting it onto a document.

Polkadot SDK provides multiple different cryptographic schemes and is generic so that it can support anything that implements the [`Pair` trait](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_core/crypto/trait.Pair.html){target=\_blank}.

### Example of Creating a Digital Signature

The process of creating and verifying a digital signature involves several steps:

1. The sender creates a hash of the message
2. The hash is encrypted using the sender's private key, creating the signature
3. The message and signature are sent to the recipient
4. The recipient decrypts the signature using the sender's public key
5. The recipient hashes the received message and compares it to the decrypted hash

If the hashes match, the signature is valid, confirming the message's integrity and the sender's identity.

## Elliptic Curve

Blockchain technology requires the ability to have multiple keys creating a signature for block proposal and validation. To this end, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr signatures are two of the most commonly used methods. While ECDSA is a far simpler implementation, Schnorr signatures are more efficient when it comes to multi-signatures.

Schnorr signatures bring some noticeable features over the ECDSA/EdDSA schemes:

- It is better for hierarchical deterministic key derivations
- It allows for native multi-signature through [signature aggregation](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/schnorr-signature-aggregation/){target=\_blank}
- It is generally more resistant to misuse

One sacrifice that is made when using Schnorr signatures over ECDSA is that both require 64 bytes, but only ECDSA signatures communicate their public key.

### Various Implementations

- [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm){target=\_blank} - Polkadot SDK provides an ECDSA signature scheme using the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1){target=\_blank} curve. This is the same cryptographic algorithm used to secure [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin){target=\_blank} and [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum){target=\_blank}

- [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519){target=\_blank} - is an EdDSA signature scheme using [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519){target=\_blank}. It is carefully engineered at several levels of design and implementation to achieve very high speeds without compromising security

- [SR25519](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/keys/accounts-more){target=\_blank} - is based on the same underlying curve as Ed25519. However, it uses Schnorr signatures instead of the EdDSA scheme

# Data Encoding

## Introduction

The Polkadot SDK uses a lightweight and efficient encoding/decoding mechanism to optimize data transmission across the network. This mechanism, known as the _SCALE_ codec, is used for serializing and deserializing data.

The SCALE codec enables communication between the runtime and the outer node. This mechanism is designed for high-performance, copy-free data encoding and decoding in resource-constrained environments like the Polkadot SDK [Wasm runtime](/develop/parachains/deployment/build-deterministic-runtime/#introduction){target=\_blank}.

It is not self-describing, meaning the decoding context must fully know the encoded data types. 

Parity's libraries utilize the [`parity-scale-codec`](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec){target=\_blank} crate (a Rust implementation of the SCALE codec) to handle encoding and decoding for interactions between RPCs and the runtime.

The `codec` mechanism is ideal for Polkadot SDK-based chains because:

- It is lightweight compared to generic serialization frameworks like [`serde`](https://serde.rs/){target=\_blank}, which add unnecessary bulk to binaries
- It doesn’t rely on Rust’s `libstd`, making it compatible with `no_std` environments like Wasm runtime
- It integrates seamlessly with Rust, allowing easy derivation of encoding and decoding logic for new types using `#[derive(Encode, Decode)]`

Defining a custom encoding scheme in the Polkadot SDK-based chains, rather than using an existing Rust codec library, is crucial for enabling cross-platform and multi-language support. 

## SCALE Codec

The codec is implemented using the following traits:

- [`Encode`](#encode)
- [`Decode`](#decode)
- [`CompactAs`](#compactas)
- [`HasCompact`](#hascompact)
- [`EncodeLike`](#encodelike)

### Encode

The [`Encode`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.Encode.html){target=\_blank} trait handles data encoding into SCALE format and includes the following key functions:

- **`size_hint(&self) -> usize`** - estimates the number of bytes required for encoding to prevent multiple memory allocations. This should be inexpensive and avoid complex operations. Optional if the size isn’t known
- **`encode_to<T: Output>(&self, dest: &mut T)`** - encodes the data, appending it to a destination buffer
- **`encode(&self) -> Vec<u8>`** - encodes the data and returns it as a byte vector
- **`using_encoded<R, F: FnOnce(&[u8]) -> R>(&self, f: F) -> R`** - encodes the data and passes it to a closure, returning the result
- **`encoded_size(&self) -> usize`** - calculates the encoded size. Should be used when the encoded data isn’t required

!!!tip
    For best performance, value types should override `using_encoded`, and allocating types should override `encode_to`. It's recommended to implement `size_hint` for all types where possible.

### Decode

The [`Decode`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.Decode.html){target=\_blank} trait handles decoding SCALE-encoded data back into the appropriate types:

- **`fn decode<I: Input>(value: &mut I) -> Result<Self, Error>`** - decodes data from the SCALE format, returning an error if decoding fails

### CompactAs

The [`CompactAs`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.CompactAs.html){target=\_blank} trait wraps custom types for compact encoding:

- **`encode_as(&self) -> &Self::As`** - encodes the type as a compact type
- **`decode_from(_: Self::As) -> Result<Self, Error>`** - decodes from a compact encoded type

### HasCompact

The [`HasCompact`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.HasCompact.html){target=\_blank} trait indicates a type supports compact encoding.

### EncodeLike

The [`EncodeLike`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec/latest/parity_scale_codec/trait.EncodeLike.html){target=\_blank} trait is used to ensure multiple types that encode similarly are accepted by the same function. When using `derive`, it is automatically implemented.

### Data Types

The table below outlines how the Rust implementation of the Parity SCALE codec encodes different data types.

| Type                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Example SCALE Decoded Value                                                                                                            | SCALE Encoded Value                                         |

| Vectors (lists, series, sets) | A collection of same-typed values is encoded, prefixed with a compact encoding of the number of items, followed by each item's encoding concatenated in turn.               | Vector of unsigned `16`-bit integers: `[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]               `                                                              | `0x18040008000f00100017002a00`                                |

## Encode and Decode Rust Trait Implementations

Here's how the `Encode` and `Decode` traits are implemented:


```rust
use parity_scale_codec::{Encode, Decode};

[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Encode, Decode)]
enum EnumType {
    #[codec(index = 15)]
    A,
    B(u32, u64),
    C {
        a: u32,
        b: u64,
    },
}

let a = EnumType::A;
let b = EnumType::B(1, 2);
let c = EnumType::C { a: 1, b: 2 };

a.using_encoded(|ref slice| {
    assert_eq!(slice, &b"\x0f");
});

b.using_encoded(|ref slice| {
    assert_eq!(slice, &b"\x01\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0");
});

c.using_encoded(|ref slice| {
    assert_eq!(slice, &b"\x02\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0");
});

let mut da: &[u8] = b"\x0f";
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut da).ok(), Some(a));

let mut db: &[u8] = b"\x01\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0";
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut db).ok(), Some(b));

let mut dc: &[u8] = b"\x02\x01\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0";
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut dc).ok(), Some(c));

let mut dz: &[u8] = &[0];
assert_eq!(EnumType::decode(&mut dz).ok(), None);
```

# Interoperability

## Introduction

Interoperability lies at the heart of the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling communication and collaboration across a diverse range of blockchains. By bridging the gaps between parachains, relay chains, and even external networks, Polkadot unlocks the potential for truly decentralized applications, efficient resource sharing, and scalable solutions.

Polkadot’s design ensures that blockchains can transcend their individual limitations by working together as part of a unified system. This cooperative architecture is what sets Polkadot apart in the blockchain landscape.

## Why Interoperability Matters

The blockchain ecosystem is inherently fragmented. Different blockchains excel in specialized domains such as finance, gaming, or supply chain management, but these chains function in isolation without interoperability. This lack of connectivity stifles the broader utility of blockchain technology.

Interoperability solves this problem by enabling blockchains to:

- **Collaborate across networks** - chains can interact to share assets, functionality, and data, creating synergies that amplify their individual strengths
- **Achieve greater scalability** - specialized chains can offload tasks to others, optimizing performance and resource utilization
- **Expand use-case potential** - cross-chain applications can leverage features from multiple blockchains, unlocking novel user experiences and solutions

In the Polkadot ecosystem, interoperability transforms a collection of isolated chains into a cohesive, efficient network, pushing the boundaries of what blockchains can achieve together.

## Key Mechanisms for Interoperability

At the core of Polkadot's cross-chain collaboration are foundational technologies designed to break down barriers between networks. These mechanisms empower blockchains to communicate, share resources, and operate as a cohesive ecosystem.

### Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM): The Backbone of Communication

Polkadot's Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) is the standard framework for interaction between parachains, relay chains, and, eventually, external blockchains. XCM provides a trustless, secure messaging format for exchanging assets, sharing data, and executing cross-chain operations.

Through XCM, decentralized applications can:

- Transfer tokens and other assets across chains
- Coordinate complex workflows that span multiple blockchains
- Enable seamless user experiences where underlying blockchain differences are invisible
- XCM exemplifies Polkadot’s commitment to creating a robust and interoperable ecosystem

For further information about XCM, check the [Introduction to XCM](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank} article.

### Bridges: Connecting External Networks

While XCM enables interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem, bridges extend this functionality to external blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. By connecting these networks, bridges allow Polkadot-based chains to access external liquidity, additional functionalities, and broader user bases.

With bridges, developers and users gain the ability to:

- Integrate external assets into Polkadot-based applications
- Combine the strengths of Polkadot’s scalability with the liquidity of other networks
- Facilitate accurate multi-chain applications that transcend ecosystem boundaries

For more information about bridges in the Polkadot ecosystem, see the [Bridge Hub](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/bridge-hub/){target=\_blank} guide.

## The Polkadot Advantage

Polkadot was purpose-built for interoperability. Unlike networks that add interoperability as an afterthought, Polkadot integrates it as a fundamental design principle. This approach offers several distinct advantages:

- **Developer empowerment** - polkadot’s interoperability tools allow developers to build applications that leverage multiple chains’ capabilities without added complexity
- **Enhanced ecosystem collaboration** - chains in Polkadot can focus on their unique strengths while contributing to the ecosystem’s overall growth
- **Future-proofing blockchain** - by enabling seamless communication, Polkadot ensures its ecosystem can adapt to evolving demands and technologies

## Looking Ahead

Polkadot’s vision of interoperability extends beyond technical functionality, representing a shift towards a more collaborative blockchain landscape. By enabling chains to work together, Polkadot fosters innovation, efficiency, and accessibility, paving the way for a decentralized future where blockchains are not isolated competitors but interconnected collaborators.

# Networks

## Introduction

The Polkadot ecosystem is built on a robust set of networks designed to enable secure and scalable development. Whether you are testing new features or deploying to live production, Polkadot offers several layers of networks tailored for each stage of the development process. From local environments to experimental networks like Kusama and community-run TestNets such as Paseo, developers can thoroughly test, iterate, and validate their applications. This guide will introduce you to Polkadot's various networks and explain how they fit into the development workflow.

## Network Overview 

Polkadot's development process is structured to ensure new features and upgrades are rigorously tested before being deployed on live production networks. The progression follows a well-defined path, starting from local environments and advancing through TestNets, ultimately reaching the Polkadot MainNet. The diagram below outlines the typical progression of the Polkadot development cycle:

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    id1[Local] --> id2[Westend] --> id4[Kusama] --> id5[Polkadot]  
    id1[Local] --> id3[Paseo] --> id5[Polkadot] 
```
This flow ensures developers can thoroughly test and iterate without risking real tokens or affecting production networks. Testing tools like [Chopsticks](#chopsticks) and various TestNets make it easier to experiment safely before releasing to production.

A typical journey through the Polkadot core protocol development process might look like this:

1. **Local development node** - development starts in a local environment, where developers can create, test, and iterate on upgrades or new features using a local development node. This stage allows rapid experimentation in an isolated setup without any external dependencies

2. **Westend** - after testing locally, upgrades are deployed to [Westend](#westend), Polkadot's primary TestNet. Westend simulates real-world conditions without using real tokens, making it the ideal place for rigorous feature testing before moving on to production networks

3. **Kusama** - once features have passed extensive testing on Westend, they move to Kusama, Polkadot's experimental and fast-moving "canary" network. Kusama operates as a high-fidelity testing ground with actual economic incentives, giving developers insights into how their features will perform in a real-world environment

4. **Polkadot** - after passing tests on Westend and Kusama, features are considered ready for deployment to Polkadot, the live production network

In addition, parachain developers can leverage local TestNets like [Zombienet](#zombienet) and deploy upgrades on parachain TestNets.

5. **Paseo** - For parachain and dApp developers, Paseo serves as a community-run TestNet that mirrors Polkadot's runtime. Like Westend for core protocol development, Paseo provides a testing ground for parachain development without affecting live networks

!!!note
    The Rococo TestNet deprecation date was October 14, 2024. Teams should use Westend for Polkadot protocol and feature testing and Paseo for chain development-related testing.

## Polkadot Development Networks

Development and testing are crucial to building robust dApps and parachains and performing network upgrades within the Polkadot ecosystem. To achieve this, developers can leverage various networks and tools that provide a risk-free environment for experimentation and validation before deploying features to live networks. These networks help avoid the costs and risks associated with real tokens, enabling testing for functionalities like governance, cross-chain messaging, and runtime upgrades.

## Kusama Network

Kusama is the experimental version of Polkadot, designed for developers who want to move quickly and test their applications in a real-world environment with economic incentives. Kusama serves as a production-grade testing ground where developers can deploy features and upgrades with the pressure of game theory and economics in mind. It mirrors Polkadot but operates as a more flexible space for innovation.

The native token for Kusama is KSM. For more information about KSM, visit the [Native Assets](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-DOT#kusama){target=\_blank} page.

## Test Networks

The following test networks provide controlled environments for testing upgrades and new features. TestNet tokens are available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}.

### Westend

Westend is Polkadot's primary permanent TestNet. Unlike temporary test networks, Westend is not reset to the genesis block, making it an ongoing environment for testing Polkadot core features. Managed by Parity Technologies, Westend ensures that developers can test features in a real-world simulation without using actual tokens.

The native token for Westend is WND. More details about WND can be found on the [Native Assets](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-DOT#getting-tokens-on-the-westend-testnet){target=\_blank} page.

### Paseo

[Paseo](https://github.com/paseo-network){target=\_blank} is a community-managed TestNet designed for parachain and dApp developers. It mirrors Polkadot's runtime and is maintained by Polkadot community members. Paseo provides a dedicated space for parachain developers to test their applications in a Polkadot-like environment without the risks associated with live networks.

The native token for Paseo is PAS. Additional information on PAS is available on the [Native Assets](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-DOT#getting-tokens-on-the-paseo-testnet){target=\_blank} page.

## Local Test Networks

Local test networks are an essential part of the development cycle for blockchain developers using the Polkadot SDK. They allow for fast, iterative testing in controlled, private environments without connecting to public TestNets. Developers can quickly spin up local instances to experiment, debug, and validate their code before deploying to larger TestNets like Westend or Paseo. Two key tools for local network testing are Zombienet and Chopsticks.

### Zombienet

[Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet){target=\_blank} is a flexible testing framework for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. It enables developers to create and manage ephemeral, short-lived networks. This feature makes Zombienet particularly useful for quick iterations, as it allows you to run multiple local networks concurrently, mimicking different runtime conditions. Whether you're developing a parachain or testing your custom blockchain logic, Zombienet gives you the tools to automate local testing.

Key features of Zombienet include:

- Creating dynamic, local networks with different configurations
- Running parachains and relay chains in a simulated environment
- Efficient testing of network components like cross-chain messaging and governance

Zombienet is ideal for developers looking to test quickly and thoroughly before moving to more resource-intensive public TestNets.

### Chopsticks

[Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks){target=\_blank} is a tool designed to create forks of Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, allowing developers to interact with network forks as part of their testing process. This capability makes Chopsticks a powerful option for testing upgrades, runtime changes, or cross-chain applications in a forked network environment.

Key features of Chopsticks include:

- Forking live Polkadot SDK-based blockchains for isolated testing
- Simulating cross-chain messages in a private, controlled setup
- Debugging network behavior by interacting with the fork in real-time

Chopsticks provides a controlled environment for developers to safely explore the effects of runtime changes. It ensures that network behavior is tested and verified before upgrades are deployed to live networks.

# Node and Runtime

## Introduction

Every blockchain platform relies on a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, that communicate with each other about transactions and blocks. In this context, a node refers to the software running on the connected devices rather than the physical or virtual machines in the network.

Polkadot SDK-based nodes consist of two main components, each with distinct responsibilities: the client (also called node) and the runtime.

If the system were a monolithic protocol, any modification would require updating the entire system. Instead, Polkadot achieves true upgradeability by defining an immutable meta-protocol (the client) and a protocol (the runtime) that can be upgraded independently.

This separation gives the [Polkadot Relay Chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain){target=\_blank} and all connected [parachains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/parachains){target=\_blank} an evolutionary advantage over other blockchain platforms.

## Architectural Principles

The Polkadot SDK-based blockchain architecture is fundamentally built on two distinct yet interconnected components:

- **Client (Meta-protocol)**
    - Handles the foundational infrastructure of the blockchain
    - Manages runtime execution, networking, consensus, and other off-chain components
    - Provides an immutable base layer that ensures network stability
    - Upgradable only through hard forks

- **Runtime (Protocol)** 
    - Defines the blockchain's state transition logic
    - Determines the specific rules and behaviors of the blockchain
    - Compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) for platform-independent execution
    - Capable of being upgraded without network-wide forking

### Advantages of this Architecture

- **Forkless upgrades** - runtime can be updated without disrupting the entire network
- **Modularity** - clear separation allows independent development of client and runtime
- **Flexibility** - enables rapid iteration and evolution of blockchain logic
- **Performance** - WebAssembly compilation provides efficient, cross-platform execution

## Node (Client)

The node, also known as the client, is the core component responsible for executing the Wasm runtime and orchestrating various essential blockchain components. It ensures the correct execution of the state transition function and manages multiple critical subsystems, including:

- **Wasm execution** - runs the blockchain runtime, which defines the state transition rules
- **Database management** - stores blockchain data
- **Networking** - facilitates peer-to-peer communication, block propagation, and transaction gossiping
- **Transaction pool (Mempool)** - manages pending transactions before they are included in a block
- **Consensus mechanism** - ensures agreement on the blockchain state across nodes
- **RPC services** - provides external interfaces for applications and users to interact with the node

## Runtime

The runtime is more than just a set of rules. It's the fundamental logic engine that defines a blockchain's entire behavior. In Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, the runtime represents a complete, self-contained description of the blockchain's state transition function.

### Characteristics

The runtime is distinguished by three key characteristics:

- **Business logic** - defines the complete application-specific blockchain behavior
- **WebAssembly compilation** - ensures platform-independent, secure execution
- **On-chain storage** - stored within the blockchain's state, allowing dynamic updates

### Key Functions

The runtime performs several critical functions, such as:

- Define state transition rules
- Implement blockchain-specific logic
- Manage account interactions
- Control transaction processing
- Define governance mechanisms
- Handle custom pallets and modules

## Communication Between Node and Runtime

The client and runtime communicate exclusively using [SCALE-encoded](/polkadot-protocol/basics/data-encoding){target=\_blank} communication. This ensures efficient and compact data exchange between the two components.

### Runtime APIs

The Runtime API consists of well-defined functions and constants a client assumes are implemented in the Runtime Wasm blob. These APIs enable the client to interact with the runtime to execute blockchain operations and retrieve information. The client invokes these APIs to:

- Build, execute, and finalize blocks
- Access metadata
- Access consensus related information
- Handle transaction execution

### Host Functions

During execution, the runtime can access certain external client functionalities via host functions. The specific functions the client exposes allow the runtime to perform operations outside the WebAssembly domain. Host functions enable the runtime to:

- Perform cryptographic operations
- Access the current blockchain state
- Handle storage modifications
- Allocate memory

# Randomness

## Introduction

Randomness is crucial in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains to ensure a fair and unpredictable distribution of validator duties. However, computers are inherently deterministic, meaning the same input always produces the same output. What we typically refer to as "random" numbers on a computer are actually pseudo-random. These numbers rely on an initial "seed," which can come from external sources like [atmospheric noise](https://www.random.org/randomness/){target=\_blank}, [heart rates](https://mdpi.altmetric.com/details/47574324){target=\_blank}, or even [lava lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand){target=\_blank}. While this may seem random, given the same "seed," the same sequence of numbers will always be generated.

In a global blockchain network, relying on real-world entropy for randomness isn’t feasible because these inputs vary by time and location. If nodes use different inputs, blockchains can fork. Hence, real-world randomness isn't suitable for use as a seed in blockchain systems.

Currently, two primary methods for generating randomness in blockchains are used: [`RANDAO`](#randao) and [`VRF`](#vrf) (Verifiable Random Function). Polkadot adopts the `VRF` approach for its randomness.

## VRF

A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a cryptographic function that generates a random number and proof that ensures the submitter produced the number. This proof allows anyone to verify the validity of the random number.

Polkadot's VRF is similar to the one used in [**Ouroboros Praos**](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf){target=\_blank}, which secures randomness for block production in systems like [BABE](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#block-production-babe){target=\_blank} (Polkadot’s block production mechanism). 

The key difference is that Polkadot's VRF doesn’t rely on a central clock—avoiding the issue of whose clock to trust. Instead, it uses its own past results and slot numbers to simulate time and determine future outcomes.

### How VRF Works

Slots on Polkadot are discrete units of time, each lasting six seconds, and can potentially hold a block. Multiple slots form an epoch, with 2400 slots making up one four-hour epoch.

In each slot, validators execute a "die roll" using a VRF. The VRF uses three inputs:

1. A "secret key," unique to each validator, is used for the die roll
2. An epoch randomness value, derived from the hash of VRF outputs from blocks two epochs ago (N-2), so past randomness influences the current epoch (N)
3. The current slot number

This process helps maintain fair randomness across the network.

Here is a graphical representation:

![](/images/polkadot-protocol/basics/blocks-transactions-fees/randomness/slots-epochs.webp)

The VRF produces two outputs: a result (the random number) and a proof (verifying that the number was generated correctly).

The result is checked by the validator against a protocol threshold. If it's below the threshold, the validator becomes a candidate for block production in that slot. 

The validator then attempts to create a block, submitting it along with the `PROOF` and `RESULT`.

So, VRF can be expressed like:

`(RESULT, PROOF) = VRF(SECRET, EPOCH_RANDOMNESS_VALUE, CURRENT_SLOT_NUMBER)`

Put simply, performing a "VRF roll" generates a random number along with proof that the number was genuinely produced and not arbitrarily chosen.

After executing the VRF, the `RESULT` is compared to a protocol-defined `THRESHOLD`. If the `RESULT` is below the `THRESHOLD`, the validator becomes a valid candidate to propose a block for that slot. Otherwise, the validator skips the slot.

As a result, there may be multiple validators eligible to propose a block for a slot. In this case, the block accepted by other nodes will prevail, provided it is on the chain with the latest finalized block as determined by the GRANDPA finality gadget. It's also possible for no block producers to be available for a slot, in which case the AURA consensus takes over. AURA is a fallback mechanism that randomly selects a validator to produce a block, running in parallel with BABE and only stepping in when no block producers exist for a slot. Otherwise, it remains inactive.

Because validators roll independently, no block candidates may appear in some slots if all roll numbers are above the threshold. 

To verify resolution of this issue and that Polkadot block times remain near constant-time, see the [PoS Consensus](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank} page of this documentation.

## RANDAO

An alternative on-chain randomness method is Ethereum's RANDAO, where validators perform thousands of hashes on a seed and publish the final hash during a round. The collective input from all validators forms the random number, and as long as one honest validator participates, the randomness is secure.

To enhance security, RANDAO can optionally be combined with a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), ensuring that randomness can't be predicted or manipulated during computation.

For more information about RANDAO, see the [Randomness - RANDAO](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/randomness/){target=\_blank} section of the Upgrading Ethereum documentation.

## VDFs

Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) are time-bound computations that, even on parallel computers, take a set amount of time to complete. 

They produce a unique result that can be quickly verified publicly. When combined with RANDAO, feeding RANDAO's output into a VDF introduces a delay that nullifies an attacker's chance to influence the randomness.

However, VDF likely requires specialized ASIC devices to run separately from standard nodes.

!!!warning 
    While only one is needed to secure the system, and they will be open-source and inexpensive, running VDF devices involves significant costs without direct incentives, adding friction for blockchain users.

## Authority

The role in a blockchain that can participate in consensus mechanisms. 

- [GRANDPA](#grandpa) - the authorities vote on chains they consider final 
- [Blind Assignment of Blockchain Extension](#blind-assignment-of-blockchain-extension-babe) (BABE) - the authorities are also [block authors](#block-author) 

Authority sets can be used as a basis for consensus mechanisms such as the [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos) protocol.

## Authority Round (Aura)

A deterministic [consensus](#consensus) protocol where block production is limited to a rotating list of [authorities](#authority) that take turns creating blocks. In authority round (Aura) consensus, most online authorities are assumed to be honest. It is often used in combination with [GRANDPA](#grandpa) as a [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus) protocol.

Learn more by reading the official [Aura consensus algorithm](https://openethereum.github.io/Aura){target=\_blank} wiki article.

## Blind Assignment of Blockchain Extension (BABE)

A [block authoring](#block-author) protocol similar to [Aura](#authority-round-aura), except [authorities](#authority) win [slots](#slot) based on a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) instead of the round-robin selection method. The winning authority can select a chain and submit a new block.

Learn more by reading the official Web3 Foundation [BABE research document](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/protocols/block-production/Babe){target=\_blank}.

## Block Author

The node responsible for the creation of a block, also called _block producers_. In a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, these nodes are called _miners_.

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

The ability of a distributed computer network to remain operational if a certain proportion of its nodes or [authorities](#authority) are defective or behaving maliciously. A distributed network is typically considered Byzantine fault tolerant if it can remain functional, with up to one-third of nodes assumed to be defective, offline, actively malicious, and part of a coordinated attack.

### Byzantine Failure

The loss of a network service due to node failures that exceed the proportion of nodes required to reach consensus.

### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)

An early approach to Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) systems tolerate Byzantine behavior from up to one-third of participants.

The communication overhead for such systems is `O(n²)`, where `n` is the number of nodes (participants) in the system.

### Preimage

A preimage is the data that is input into a hash function to calculate a hash. Since a hash function is a [one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function){target=\_blank}, the output, the hash, cannot be used to reveal the input, the preimage.

## Call

In the context of pallets containing functions to be dispatched to the runtime, `Call` is an enumeration data type that describes the functions that can be dispatched with one variant per pallet. A `Call` represents a [dispatch](#dispatchable) data structure object.

## Chain Specification 

A chain specification file defines the properties required to run a node in an active or new Polkadot SDK-built network. It often contains the initial genesis runtime code, network properties (such as the network's name), the initial state for some pallets, and the boot node list. The chain specification file makes it easy to use a single Polkadot SDK codebase as the foundation for multiple independently configured chains.

## Collator

An [author](#block-author) of a [parachain](#parachain) network.
They aren't [authorities](#authority) in themselves, as they require a [relay chain](#relay-chain) to coordinate [consensus](#consensus).

More details are found on the [Polkadot Collator Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-collator){target=\_blank}.

## Collective

Most often used to refer to an instance of the Collective pallet on Polkadot SDK-based networks such as [Kusama](#kusama) or [Polkadot](#polkadot) if the Collective pallet is part of the FRAME-based runtime for the network.

## Consensus

Consensus is the process blockchain nodes use to agree on a chain's canonical fork. It is composed of [authorship](#block-author), finality, and [fork-choice rule](#fork-choice-rulestrategy). In the Polkadot ecosystem, these three components are usually separate and the term consensus often refers specifically to authorship.

See also [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus).

## Consensus Algorithm

Ensures a set of [actors](#authority)—who don't necessarily trust each other—can reach an agreement about the state as the result of some computation. Most consensus algorithms assume that up to one-third of the actors or nodes can be [Byzantine fault tolerant](#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft).

Consensus algorithms are generally concerned with ensuring two properties:

- **Safety** - indicating that all honest nodes eventually agreed on the state of the chain
- **Liveness** - indicating the ability of the chain to keep progressing

## Consensus Engine

The node subsystem responsible for consensus tasks.

For detailed information about the consensus strategies of the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network, see the [Polkadot Consensus](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus){target=\_blank} blog series.

See also [hybrid consensus](#hybrid-consensus).

## Coretime

The time allocated for utilizing a core, measured in relay chain blocks. There are two types of coretime: *on-demand* and *bulk*.

On-demand coretime refers to coretime acquired through bidding in near real-time for the validation of a single parachain block on one of the cores reserved specifically for on-demand orders. They are available as an on-demand coretime pool. Set of cores that are available on-demand. Cores reserved through bulk coretime could also be made available in the on-demand coretime pool, in parts or in entirety.

Bulk coretime is a fixed duration of continuous coretime represented by an NFT that can be split, shared, or resold. It is managed by the [Broker pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## Development Phrase

A [mnemonic phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic#For_numerical_sequences_and_mathematical_operations){target=\_blank} that is intentionally made public.

Well-known development accounts, such as Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve, and Ferdie, are generated from the same secret phrase:

```
bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk
```

Many tools in the Polkadot SDK ecosystem, such as [`subkey`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/bin/utils/subkey){target=\_blank}, allow you to implicitly specify an account using a derivation path such as `//Alice`.

## Digest

An extensible field of the [block header](#header) that encodes information needed by several actors in a blockchain network, including:

- [Light clients](#light-client) for chain synchronization
- Consensus engines for block verification
- The runtime itself, in the case of pre-runtime digests

## Dispatchable

Function objects that act as the entry points in FRAME [pallets](#pallet). Internal or external entities can call them to interact with the blockchain’s state. They are a core aspect of the runtime logic, handling [transactions](#transaction) and other state-changing operations.

## Events

A means of recording that some particular [state](#state) transition happened.

In the context of [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities), events are composable data types that each [pallet](#pallet) can individually define. Events in FRAME are implemented as a set of transient storage items inspected immediately after a block has been executed and reset during block initialization.

## Executor

A means of executing a function call in a given [runtime](#runtime) with a set of dependencies.
There are two orchestration engines in Polkadot SDK, _WebAssembly_ and _native_.

- The _native executor_ uses a natively compiled runtime embedded in the node to execute calls. This is a performance optimization available to up-to-date nodes

- The _WebAssembly executor_ uses a [Wasm](#webassembly-wasm) binary and a Wasm interpreter to execute calls. The binary is guaranteed to be up-to-date regardless of the version of the blockchain node because it is persisted in the [state](#state) of the Polkadot SDK-based chain

## Existential Deposit

The minimum balance an account is allowed to have in the [Balances pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/index.html){target=\_blank}. Accounts cannot be created with a balance less than the existential deposit amount. 

If an account balance drops below this amount, the Balances pallet uses [a FRAME System API](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.dec_ref){target=\_blank} to drop its references to that account.

If the Balances pallet reference to an account is dropped, the account can be [reaped](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.allow_death){target=\_blank}.

## Extrinsic

A general term for data that originates outside the runtime, is included in a block, and leads to some action. This includes user-initiated transactions and inherent transactions placed into the block by the block builder.

It is a SCALE-encoded array typically consisting of a version number, signature, and varying data types indicating the resulting runtime function to be called. Extrinsics can take two forms: [inherents](#inherent-transactions) and [transactions](#transaction). 

For more technical details, see the [Polkadot spec](https://spec.polkadot.network/id-extrinsics){target=\_blank}.

## Fork Choice Rule/Strategy

A fork choice rule or strategy helps determine which chain is valid when reconciling several network forks. A common fork choice rule is the [longest chain](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus/struct.LongestChain.html){target=\_blank}, in which the chain with the most blocks is selected.

## FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)

Enables developers to create blockchain [runtime](#runtime) environments from a modular set of components called [pallets](#pallet). It utilizes a set of procedural macros to construct runtimes.

[Visit the Polkadot SDK docs for more details on FRAME.](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html){target=\_blank}

## Full Node

A node that prunes historical states, keeping only recently finalized block states to reduce storage needs. Full nodes provide current chain state access and allow direct submission and validation of [extrinsics](#extrinsic), maintaining network decentralization.

## Genesis Configuration

A mechanism for specifying the initial state of a blockchain. By convention, this initial state or first block is commonly referred to as the genesis state or genesis block. The genesis configuration for Polkadot SDK-based chains is accomplished by way of a [chain specification](#chain-specification) file.

## GRANDPA

A deterministic finality mechanism for blockchains that is implemented in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language.

The [formal specification](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa-old.pdf){target=\_blank} is maintained by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/){target=\_blank}.

## Header

A structure that aggregates the information used to summarize a block. Primarily, it consists of cryptographic information used by [light clients](#light-client) to get minimally secure but very efficient chain synchronization.

## Hybrid Consensus

A blockchain consensus protocol that consists of independent or loosely coupled mechanisms for [block production](#block-author) and finality.

Hybrid consensus allows the chain to grow as fast as probabilistic consensus protocols, such as [Aura](#authority-round-aura), while maintaining the same level of security as deterministic finality consensus protocols, such as [GRANDPA](#grandpa).

## Inherent Transactions

A special type of unsigned transaction, referred to as _inherents_, that enables a block authoring node to insert information that doesn't require validation directly into a block.

Only the block-authoring node that calls the inherent transaction function can insert data into its block. In general, validators assume the data inserted using an inherent transaction is valid and reasonable even if it can't be deterministically verified.

## JSON-RPC

A stateless, lightweight remote procedure call protocol encoded in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON-RPC provides a standard way to call functions on a remote system by using JSON.

For Polkadot SDK, this protocol is implemented through the [Parity JSON-RPC](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpc){target=\_blank} crate.

## Keystore

A subsystem for managing keys for the purpose of producing new blocks.

## Kusama

[Kusama](https://kusama.network/){target=\_blank} is a Polkadot SDK-based blockchain that implements a design similar to the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network.

Kusama is a [canary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine){target=\_blank} network and is referred to as [Polkadot's "wild cousin."](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-comparisons-kusama){target=\_blank}

As a canary network, Kusama is expected to be more stable than a test network like [Westend](#westend) but less stable than a production network like [Polkadot](#polkadot). Kusama is controlled by its network participants and is intended to be stable enough to encourage meaningful experimentation.

## libp2p

A peer-to-peer networking stack that allows the use of many transport mechanisms, including WebSockets (usable in a web browser).

Polkadot SDK uses the [Rust implementation](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p){target=\_blank} of the `libp2p` networking stack.

## Light Client

A type of blockchain node that doesn't store the [chain state](#state) or produce blocks.

A light client can verify cryptographic primitives and provides a [remote procedure call (RPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call){target=\_blank} server, enabling blockchain users to interact with the network.

## Metadata

Data that provides information about one or more aspects of a system.
The metadata that exposes information about a Polkadot SDK blockchain enables you to interact with that system.

## Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)

A method for determining [validators](#validator) or _[authorities](#authority)_ based on a willingness to commit their stake to the proper functioning of one or more block-producing nodes.

## Oracle

An entity that connects a blockchain to a non-blockchain data source. Oracles enable the blockchain to access and act upon information from existing data sources and incorporate data from non-blockchain systems and services.

## Origin

A [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities) primitive that identifies the source of a [dispatched](#dispatchable) function call into the [runtime](#runtime). The FRAME System pallet defines three built-in [origins](#origin). As a [pallet](#pallet) developer, you can also define custom origins, such as those defined by the [Collective pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_collective/enum.RawOrigin.html){target=\_blank}.

## Pallet

A module that can be used to extend the capabilities of a [FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities)-based [runtime](#runtime).
Pallets bundle domain-specific logic with runtime primitives like [events](#events) and [storage items](#storage-item).

## Parachain

A parachain is a blockchain that derives shared infrastructure and security from a _[relay chain](#relay-chain)_.
You can learn more about parachains on the [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains){target=\_blank}.

## Paseo

Paseo TestNet provisions testing on Polkadot's "production" runtime, which means less chance of feature or code mismatch when developing parachain apps. Specifically, after the [Polkadot Technical fellowship](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship){target=\_blank} proposes a runtime upgrade for Polkadot, this TestNet is updated, giving a period where the TestNet will be ahead of Polkadot to allow for testing.

## Polkadot

The [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network/){target=\_blank} is a blockchain that serves as the central hub of a heterogeneous blockchain network. It serves the role of the [relay chain](#relay-chain) and provides shared infrastructure and security to support [parachains](#parachain).

## Relay Chain

Relay chains are blockchains that provide shared infrastructure and security to the [parachains](#parachain) in the network. In addition to providing [consensus](#consensus) capabilities, relay chains allow parachains to communicate and exchange digital assets without needing to trust one another.

## Rococo

A [parachain](#parachain) test network for the Polkadot network. The [Rococo](#rococo) network is a Polkadot SDK-based blockchain with an October 14, 2024 deprecation date. Development teams are encouraged to use the Paseo TestNet instead.

## Runtime

The runtime represents the [state transition function](#state-transition-function-stf) for a blockchain. In Polkadot SDK, the runtime is stored as a [Wasm](#webassembly-wasm) binary in the chain state. The Runtime is stored under a unique state key and can be modified during the execution of the state transition function.

## Slot

A fixed, equal interval of time used by consensus engines such as [Aura](#authority-round-aura) and [BABE](#blind-assignment-of-blockchain-extension-babe). In each slot, a subset of [authorities](#authority) is permitted, or obliged, to [author](#block-author) a block.

## Sovereign Account

The unique account identifier for each chain in the relay chain ecosystem. It is often used in cross-consensus (XCM) interactions to sign XCM messages sent to the relay chain or other chains in the ecosystem.

The sovereign account for each chain is a root-level account that can only be accessed using the Sudo pallet or through governance. The account identifier is calculated by concatenating the Blake2 hash of a specific text string and the registered parachain identifier.

## SS58 Address Format

A public key address based on the Bitcoin [`Base-58-check`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding){target=\_blank} encoding. Each Polkadot SDK SS58 address uses a `base-58` encoded value to identify a specific account on a specific Polkadot SDK-based chain

The [canonical `ss58-registry`](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry){target=\_blank} provides additional details about the address format used by different Polkadot SDK-based chains, including the network prefix and website used for different networks

## State Transition Function (STF)

The logic of a blockchain that determines how the state changes when a block is processed. In Polkadot SDK, the state transition function is effectively equivalent to the [runtime](#runtime).

## Storage Item

[FRAME](#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities) primitives that provide type-safe data persistence capabilities to the [runtime](#runtime).
Learn more in the [storage items](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/storage/types/index.html){target=\_blank} reference document in the Polkadot SDK.

## Substrate

A flexible framework for building modular, efficient, and upgradeable blockchains. Substrate is written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language and is maintained by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/){target=\_blank}.

## Transaction

An [extrinsic](#extrinsic) that includes a signature that can be used to verify the account authorizing it inherently or via [signed extensions](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/signed_extensions/index.html){target=\_blank}.

## Transaction Era

A definable period expressed as a range of block numbers during which a transaction can be included in a block.
Transaction eras are used to protect against transaction replay attacks if an account is reaped and its replay-protecting nonce is reset to zero.

## Trie (Patricia Merkle Tree)

A data structure used to represent sets of key-value pairs and enables the items in the data set to be stored and retrieved using a cryptographic hash. Because incremental changes to the data set result in a new hash, retrieving data is efficient even if the data set is very large. With this data structure, you can also prove whether the data set includes any particular key-value pair without access to the entire data set.

In Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, state is stored in a trie data structure that supports the efficient creation of incremental digests. This trie is exposed to the [runtime](#runtime) as [a simple key/value map](#storage-item) where both keys and values can be arbitrary byte arrays.

## Validator

A validator is a node that participates in the consensus mechanism of the network. Its roles include block production, transaction validation, network integrity, and security maintenance.

## WebAssembly (Wasm)

An execution architecture that allows for the efficient, platform-neutral expression of
deterministic, machine-executable logic.

[Wasm](https://webassembly.org/){target=\_blank} can be compiled from many languages, including
the [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} programming language. Polkadot SDK-based chains use a Wasm binary to provide portable [runtimes](#runtime) that can be included as part of the chain's state.

## Weight

A convention used in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains to measure and manage the time it takes to validate a block.
Polkadot SDK defines one unit of weight as one picosecond of execution time on reference hardware.

The maximum block weight should be equivalent to one-third of the target block time with an allocation of one-third each for:

- Block construction
- Network propagation
- Import and verification

By defining weights, you can trade-off the number of transactions per second and the hardware required to maintain the target block time appropriate for your use case. Weights are defined in the runtime, meaning you can tune them using runtime updates to keep up with hardware and software improvements.

## Westend

Westend is a Parity-maintained, Polkadot SDK-based blockchain that serves as a test network for the [Polkadot](#polkadot) network.

# Learn About the Polkadot Protocol

The Polkadot protocol is designed to enable scalable, secure, and interoperable networks. It introduces a unique multichain architecture that allows independent blockchains, known as parachains, to operate seamlessly while benefiting from the shared security of the relay chain. Polkadot’s decentralized governance ensures that network upgrades and decisions are community-driven, while its cross-chain messaging and interoperability features make it a hub for multichain applications.

This section offers a comprehensive technical overview of the Polkadot Protocol, delving into its multichain architecture, foundational principles, cryptographic underpinnings, and on-chain governance system. These key components constitute the core building blocks that power Polkadot, enabling seamless collaboration between parachains, efficient network operation, and decentralized decision-making through OpenGov. 

Whether you're new to blockchain or an experienced developer, you'll gain insights into how the Polkadot Protocol enables scalable, interoperable, and decentralized networks.

# On-Chain Governance

Polkadot's on-chain governance system, OpenGov, enables decentralized decision-making across the network. It empowers stakeholders to propose, vote on, and enact changes with transparency and efficiency. This system ensures that governance is both flexible and inclusive, allowing developers to integrate custom governance solutions and mechanisms within the network. Understanding how OpenGov functions is crucial for anyone looking to engage with Polkadot’s decentralized ecosystem, whether you’re proposing upgrades, managing referenda, or exploring voting structures.

At the core of Polkadot’s governance system are three key pallets: Preimage, Referenda, and Conviction Voting. These components enable flexible, decentralized decision-making, providing developers with the tools to create tailored governance solutions. This modular approach ensures governance remains dynamic, secure, and adaptable, fostering deeper participation and alignment with the network’s goals. By leveraging these pallets, developers can build custom governance models that shape the evolution of the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Start Building Governance Solutions

To develop solutions related to Polkadot's governance system, it’s essential to understand three key pallets:

- [**Preimage**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_preimage/index.html){target=\_blank} - stores and manages the content or the detailed information of a referendum proposal before it is voted on
- [**Referenda**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_referenda/index.html){target=\_blank} - manages the lifecycle of a referendum, including proposal submission, voting, and execution. Once a referendum is proposed and voted on, it can be enacted if it passes the required threshold
- [**Conviction Voting**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_conviction_voting/index.html){target=\_blank} - manages the voting power based on the "conviction" or commitment of voters, providing a more flexible and nuanced voting mechanism

# Origins and Tracks

## Introduction

Polkadot's OpenGov system empowers decentralized decision-making and active community participation by tailoring the governance process to the impact of proposed changes. Through a system of origins and tracks, OpenGov ensures that every referendum receives the appropriate scrutiny, balancing security, inclusivity, and efficiency.

This guide will help you understand the role of origins in classifying proposals by privilege and priority. You will learn how tracks guide proposals through tailored stages like voting, confirmation, and enactment and how to select the correct origin for your referendum to align with community expectations and network governance.

Origins and tracks are vital in streamlining the governance workflow and maintaining Polkadot's resilience and adaptability.

## Origins

Origins are the foundation of Polkadot's OpenGov governance system. They categorize proposals by privilege and define their decision-making rules. Each origin corresponds to a specific level of importance and risk, guiding how referendums progress through the governance process.

- High-privilege origins like Root Origin govern critical network changes, such as core software upgrades
- Lower-privilege origins like Small Spender handle minor requests, such as community project funding under 10,000 DOT

Proposers select an origin based on the nature of their referendum. Origins determine parameters like approval thresholds, required deposits, and timeframes for voting and confirmation. Each origin is paired with a track, which acts as a roadmap for the proposal's lifecycle, including preparation, voting, and enactment.

For a detailed list of origins and their associated parameters, see the [Polkadot OpenGov Origins](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins){target=\_blank} entry in the Polkadot Wiki.

## Tracks

Tracks define a referendum's journey from submission to enactment, tailoring governance parameters to the impact of proposed changes. Each track operates independently and includes several key stages:

- **Preparation** - time for community discussion before voting begins
- **Voting** - period for token holders to cast their votes
- **Decision** - finalization of results and determination of the proposal's outcome
- **Confirmation** - period to verify sustained community support before enactment
- **Enactment** - final waiting period before the proposal takes effect

Tracks customize these stages with parameters like decision deposit requirements, voting durations, and approval thresholds, ensuring proposals from each origin receive the required scrutiny and process. For example, a runtime upgrade in the Root Origin track will have longer timeframes and stricter thresholds than a treasury request in the Small Spender track.

# On-Chain Governance 

## Introduction

Polkadot’s governance system exemplifies decentralized decision-making, empowering its community of stakeholders to shape the network’s future through active participation. The latest evolution, OpenGov, builds on Polkadot’s foundation by providing a more inclusive and efficient governance model.

This guide will explain the principles and structure of OpenGov and walk you through its key components, such as Origins, Tracks, and Delegation. You will learn about improvements over earlier governance systems, including streamlined voting processes and enhanced stakeholder participation.

With OpenGov, Polkadot achieves a flexible, scalable, and democratic governance framework that allows multiple proposals to proceed simultaneously, ensuring the network evolves in alignment with its community's needs.

## Governance Evolution

Polkadot’s governance journey began with [Governance V1](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/learn-governance#governance-summary){target=\_blank}, a system that proved effective in managing treasury funds and protocol upgrades. However, it faced limitations, such as:

- Slow voting cycles, causing delays in decision-making
- Inflexibility in handling multiple referendums, restricting scalability

To address these challenges, Polkadot introduced OpenGov, a governance model designed for greater inclusivity, efficiency, and scalability. OpenGov replaces the centralized structures of Governance V1, such as the Council and Technical Committee, with a fully decentralized and dynamic framework.

For a full comparison of the historic and current governance models, visit the [Gov1 vs. Polkadot OpenGov](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#gov1-vs-polkadot-opengov){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot Wiki.

## OpenGov Key Features

OpenGov transforms Polkadot’s governance into a decentralized, stakeholder-driven model, eliminating centralized decision-making bodies like the Council. Key enhancements include:

- **Decentralization** - shifts all decision-making power to the public, ensuring a more democratic process
- **Enhanced delegation** - allows users to delegate their votes to trusted experts across specific governance tracks
- **Simultaneous referendums** - multiple proposals can progress at once, enabling faster decision-making
- **Polkadot Technical Fellowship** - a broad, community-driven group replacing the centralized Technical Committee

This new system ensures Polkadot governance remains agile and inclusive, even as the ecosystem grows.

## Origins and Tracks

In OpenGov, origins and tracks are central to managing proposals and votes.

- **Origin** - determines the authority level of a proposal (e.g., Treasury, Root) which decides the track of all referendums from that origin
- **Track** - define the procedural flow of a proposal, such as voting duration, approval thresholds, and enactment timelines

Developers must be aware that referendums from different origins and tracks will take varying amounts of time to reach approval and enactment. The [Polkadot Technical Fellowship](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship){target=\_blank} has the option to shorten this timeline by whitelisting a proposal and allowing it to be enacted through the [Whitelist Caller](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#whitelisted-caller){target=\_blank} origin.

Visit [Origins and Tracks Info](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#origins-and-tracks){target=\_blank} for details on current origins and tracks, associated terminology, and parameters.

## Referendums

In OpenGov, anyone can submit a referendum, fostering an open and participatory system. The timeline for a referendum depends on the privilege level of the origin with more significant changes offering more time for community voting and participation before enactment. 

The timeline for an individual referendum includes four distinct periods:

- **Lead-in** - a minimum amount of time to allow for community participation, available room in the origin, and payment of the decision deposit. Voting is open during this period
- **Decision** - voting continues
- **Confirmation** - referendum must meet [approval and support](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#approval-and-support){target=\_blank} criteria during entire period to avoid rejection
- **Enactment** - changes approved by the referendum are executed

### Vote on Referendums

Voters can vote with their tokens on each referendum. Polkadot uses a voluntary token locking mechanism, called conviction voting, as a way for voters to increase their voting power. A token holder signals they have a stronger preference for approving a proposal based upon their willingness to lock up tokens. Longer voluntary token locks are seen as a signal of continual approval and translate to increased voting weight.

See [Voting on a Referendum](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#voting-on-a-referendum){target=\_blank} for a deeper look at conviction voting and related token locks.

### Delegate Voting Power

The OpenGov system also supports multi-role delegations, allowing token holders to assign their voting power on different tracks to entities with expertise in those areas. 

For example, if a token holder lacks the technical knowledge to evaluate proposals on the [Root track](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#root){target=\_blank}, they can delegate their voting power for that track to an expert they trust to vote in the best interest of the network. This ensures informed decision-making across tracks while maintaining flexibility for token holders.

Visit [Multirole Delegation](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#multirole-delegation){target=\_blank} for more details on delegating voting power.

### Cancel a Referendum

Polkadot OpenGov has two origins for rejecting ongoing referendums: 

- [**Referendum Canceller**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#referendum-canceller){target=\_blank} - cancels an active referendum when non-malicious errors occur and refunds the deposits to the originators
- [**Referendum Killer**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#referendum-killer){target=\_blank} - used for urgent, malicious cases this origin instantly terminates an active referendum and slashes deposits

See [Cancelling, Killing, and Blacklisting](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#cancelling-killing--blacklisting){target=\_blank} for additional information on rejecting referendums.

# Tutorials for Managing XCM Channels

Establishing [XCM channels](/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/) is essential to unlocking Polkadot's native interoperability. Before bridging assets or sending cross-chain contract calls, the necessary XCM channels must be established.

These tutorials guide you through the process of setting up [Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP)](/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/#establishing-hrmp-channels) channels for cross-chain messaging. Learn how to configure unidirectional channels [between parachains](/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/) and the simplified single-message process for bidirectional channels with [system parachains like Asset Hub](/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-system/).

## Understand the Process of Opening Channels

Each parachain starts with two default unidirectional XCM channels: an upward channel for sending messages to the relay chain, and a downward channel for receiving messages. These channels are implicitly available.

To enable communication between parachains, explicit HRMP channels must be established by registering them on the relay chain. This process requires a deposit to cover the costs associated with storing message queues on the relay chain. The deposit amount depends on the specific relay chain’s parameters.

title: Opening HRMP Channels Between Parachains
description: Learn how to open HRMP channels between parachains on Polkadot. Discover the step-by-step process for establishing uni- and bidirectional communication.

# Opening HRMP Channels Between Parachains

## Introduction

For establishing communication channels between parachains on the Polkadot network using the Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP) protocol, the following steps are required:

1. **Channel request** - the parachain that wants to open an HRMP channel must make a request to the parachain it wishes to have an open channel with
2. **Channel acceptance** - the other parachain must then accept this request to complete the channel establishment

This process results in a unidirectional HRMP channel, where messages can flow in only one direction between the two parachains.

An additional HRMP channel must be established in the opposite direction to enable bidirectional communication. This requires repeating the request and acceptance process but with the parachains reversing their roles.

Once both unidirectional channels are established, the parachains can send messages back and forth freely through the bidirectional HRMP communication channel.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- Blockchain network with a relay chain and at least two connected parachains
- Wallet with sufficient funds to execute transactions on the participant chains

## Procedure to Initiate an HRMP Channel

This example will demonstrate how to open a channel between parachain 2500 and parachain 2600, using Rococo Local as the relay chain.

### Fund Sender Sovereign Account
<!-- This content will be moved to a new page because it is used in multiple places -->
The [sovereign account](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format/blob/10726875bd3016c5e528c85ed6e82415e4b847d7/README.md?plain=1#L50){target=_blank} for parachain 2500 on the relay chain must be funded so it can take care of any XCM transact fees.

Use [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} UI to connect to the relay chain and transfer funds from your account to the parachain 2500 sovereign account.
![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/hrmp-channels-2.webp)

??? note "Calculating Parachain Sovereign Account"
    To generate the sovereign account address for a parachain, you'll need to follow these steps:

    1. Determine if the parachain is an "up/down" chain (parent or child) or a "sibling" chain:

        - Up/down chains use the prefix `0x70617261` (which decodes to `b"para"`)

        - Sibling chains use the prefix `0x7369626c` (which decodes to `b"sibl"`)

    2. Calculate the u32 scale encoded value of the parachain ID:
        - Parachain 2500 would be encoded as `c4090000`

    3. Combine the prefix and parachain ID encoding to form the full sovereign account address:

        The sovereign account of parachain 2500 in relay chain will be `0x70617261c4090000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
        and the SS58 format of this address is `5Ec4AhPSY2GEE4VoHUVheqv5wwq2C1HMKa7c9fVJ1WKivX1Y`
    
    To perform this conversion, you can also use the **"Para ID" to Address** section in [Substrate Utilities](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/){target=_blank}.

### Create Channel Opening Extrinsic

1. In Polkadot.js Apps, connect to the relay chain, navigate to the **Developer** dropdown and select the **Extrinsics** option

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-1.webp)

2. Construct an `hrmpInitOpenChannel` extrinsic call

    1. Select the **`hrmp`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`hrmpInitOpenChannel`** extrinsic
    3. Fill in the parameters
        - **`recipient`** - parachain ID of the target chain (in this case, 2600)
        - **`proposedMaxCapacity`** - max number of messages that can be pending in the channel at once
        - **`proposedMaxMessageSize`** - max message size that could be put into the channel
    4. Copy the encoded call data
    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-2.webp)
    The encoded call data for opening a channel with parachain 2600 is `0x3c00280a00000800000000001000`.

### Craft and Submit the XCM Message from the Sender

To initiate the HRMP channel opening process, you need to create an XCM message that includes the encoded `hrmpInitOpenChannel` call data from the previous step. This message will be sent from your parachain to the relay chain.

This example uses the `sudo` pallet to dispatch the extrinsic. Verify the XCM configuration of the parachain you're working with and ensure you're using an origin with the necessary privileges to execute the `polkadotXcm.send` extrinsic.

The XCM message should contain the following instructions:

- **`WithdrawAsset`** - withdraws assets from the origin's ownership and places them in the Holding Register
- **`BuyExecution`** - pays for the execution of the current message using the assets in the Holding Register
- **`Transact`** - execute the encoded transaction call
- **`RefundSurplus`** - increases the Refunded Weight Register to the value of the Surplus Weight Register, attempting to reclaim any excess fees paid via BuyExecution
- **`DepositAsset`** - subtracts assets from the Holding Register and deposits equivalent on-chain assets under the specified beneficiary's ownership

!!!note 
    For more detailed information about XCM's functionality, complexities, and instruction set, refer to the [xcm-format](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format){target=_blank} documentation.

In essence, this process withdraws funds from the parachain's sovereign account to the XCVM Holding Register, then uses these funds to purchase execution time for the XCM `Transact` instruction, executes `Transact`, refunds any unused execution time and deposits any remaining funds into a specified account.

To send the XCM message to the relay chain, connect to parachain 2500 in Polkadot.js Apps. Fill in the required parameters as shown in the image below, ensuring that you:

1. Replace the **`call`** field with your encoded `hrmpInitOpenChannel` call data from the previous step
2. Use the correct beneficiary information
3. Click the **Submit Transaction** button to dispatch the XCM message to the relay chain

![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-3.webp)

!!! note
    The exact process and parameters for submitting this XCM message may vary depending on your specific parachain and relay chain configurations. Always refer to the most current documentation for your particular network setup.

After submitting the XCM message to initiate the HRMP channel opening, you should verify that the request was successful. Follow these steps to check the status of your channel request:

1. Using Polkadot.js Apps, connect to the relay chain and navigate to the **Developer** dropdown, then select the **Chain state** option

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/hrmp-channels-1.webp)

2. Query the HRMP open channel requests
    1. Select **`hrmp`**
    2. Choose the **`hrmpOpenChannelRequests`** call
    3. Click the **+** button to execute the query
    4. Check the status of all pending channel requests

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-4.webp)

If your channel request was successful, you should see an entry for your parachain ID in the list of open channel requests. This confirms that your request has been properly registered on the relay chain and is awaiting acceptance by the target parachain.

## Procedure to Accept an HRMP Channel

For the channel to be fully established, the target parachain must accept the channel request by submitting an XCM message to the relay chain.

### Fund Receiver Sovereign Account

Before proceeding, ensure that the sovereign account of parachain 2600 on the relay chain is funded. This account will be responsible for covering any XCM transact fees.
To fund the account, follow the same process described in the previous section, [Fund Sovereign Account](#fund-sender-sovereign-account).

### Create Channel Accepting Extrinsic

1. In Polkadot.js Apps, connect to the relay chain, navigate to the **Developer** dropdown and select the **Extrinsics** option

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-1.webp)

2. Construct an `hrmpAcceptOpenChannel` extrinsic call

    1. Select the **`hrmp`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`hrmpAcceptOpenChannel`** extrinsic
    3. Fill in the parameters:
        - **`sender`** - parachain ID of the requesting chain (in this case, 2500)
    4. Copy the encoded call data
    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-5.webp)
    The encoded call data for accepting a channel with parachain 2500 should be `0x3c01c4090000`

### Craft and Submit the XCM Message from the Receiver

To accept the HRMP channel opening, you need to create and submit an XCM message that includes the encoded `hrmpAcceptOpenChannel` call data from the previous step. This process is similar to the one described in the previous section, [Craft and Submit the XCM Message](#craft-and-submit-the-xcm-message-from-the-sender), with a few key differences:

- Use the encoded call data for `hrmpAcceptOpenChannel` obtained in Step 2 of this section
- In the last XCM instruction (DepositAsset), set the beneficiary to parachain 2600's sovereign account to receive any surplus funds

To send the XCM message to the relay chain, connect to parachain 2600 in Polkadot.js Apps. Fill in the required parameters as shown in the image below, ensuring that you:

1. Replace the **`call`** field with your encoded `hrmpAcceptOpenChannel` call data from the previous step
2. Use the correct beneficiary information
3. Click the **Submit Transaction** button to dispatch the XCM message to the relay chain

![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-6.webp)

After submitting the XCM message to accept the HRMP channel opening, verify that the channel has been set up correctly.

1. Using Polkadot.js Apps, connect to the relay chain and navigate to the **Developer** dropdown, then select the **Chain state** option

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/hrmp-channels-1.webp)

2. Query the HRMP channels
    1. Select **`hrmp`**
    2. Choose the **`hrmpChannels`** call
    3. Click the **+** button to execute the query
    4. Check the status of the opened channel

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-7.webp)

If the channel has been successfully established, you should see the channel details in the query results.

By following these steps, you will have successfully accepted the HRMP channel request and established a unidirectional channel between the two parachains. 

!!! note
    Remember that for full bidirectional communication, you'll need to repeat this process in the opposite direction, with parachain 2600 initiating a channel request to parachain 2500.

# Opening HRMP Channels with System Parachains

## Introduction

While establishing Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP) channels between regular parachains involves a two-step request and acceptance procedure, opening channels with system parachains follows a more straightforward approach.

System parachains are specialized chains that provide core functionality to the Polkadot network. Examples include Asset Hub for cross-chain asset transfers and Bridge Hub for connecting to external networks. Given their critical role, establishing communication channels with these system parachains has been optimized for efficiency and ease of use.

Any parachain can establish a bidirectional channel with a system chain through a single operation, requiring just one XCM message from the parachain to the relay chain.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this process, you'll need to have the following in place:

- Access to a blockchain network consisting of:
    - A relay chain
    - A parachain
    - An Asset Hub system chain
- A wallet containing enough funds to cover transaction fees on each of the participating chains

## Procedure to Establish an HRMP Channel

This guide demonstrates opening an HRMP channel between parachain 2500 and system chain Asset Hub (parachain 1000) on the Rococo Local relay chain.

The [sovereign account](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format/blob/10726875bd3016c5e528c85ed6e82415e4b847d7/README.md?plain=1#L50){target=_blank} for parachain 2500 on the relay chain must be funded so it can take care of any XCM transact fees.

Use [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} UI to connect to the relay chain and transfer funds from your account to the parachain 2500 sovereign account.

![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/hrmp-channels-2.webp)

??? note "Calculating Parachain Sovereign Account"
    To generate the sovereign account address for a parachain, you'll need to follow these steps:

    1. Determine if the parachain is an "up/down" chain (parent or child) or a "sibling" chain:

        - Up/down chains use the prefix `0x70617261` (which decodes to `b"para"`)

        - Sibling chains use the prefix `0x7369626c` (which decodes to `b"sibl"`)

    2. Calculate the u32 scale encoded value of the parachain ID:
        - Parachain 2500 would be encoded as `c4090000`

    3. Combine the prefix and parachain ID encoding to form the full sovereign account address:

        The sovereign account of parachain 2500 in relay chain will be `0x70617261c4090000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
        and the SS58 format of this address is `5Ec4AhPSY2GEE4VoHUVheqv5wwq2C1HMKa7c9fVJ1WKivX1Y`
    
    To perform this conversion, you can also use the **"Para ID" to Address** section in [Substrate Utilities](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/){target=\_blank}.

### Create Establish Channel with System Extrinsic

1. In Polkadot.js Apps, connect to the relay chain, navigate to the **Developer** dropdown and select the **Extrinsics** option

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-para/hrmp-para-to-para-1.webp)

2. Construct an `establish_channel_with_system` extrinsic call

    1. Select the **`hrmp`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`establish_channel_with_system`** extrinsic
    3. Fill in the parameters:
        - **`target_system_chain`** - parachain ID of the target system chain (in this case, 1000)
    4. Copy the encoded call data
    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-system/hrmp-para-to-system-1.webp)
    The encoded call data for establishing a channel with system parachain 1000 should be `0x3c0ae8030000`

### Craft and Submit the XCM Message

Connect to parachain 2500 using Polkadot.js Apps to send the XCM message to the relay chain. Input the necessary parameters as illustrated in the image below. Make sure to:

1. Insert your previously encoded `establish_channel_with_system` call data into the **`call`** field
2. Provide beneficiary details
3. Dispatch the XCM message to the relay chain by clicking the **Submit Transaction** button
![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-system/hrmp-para-to-system-2.webp)

!!! note
    The exact process and parameters for submitting this XCM message may vary depending on your specific parachain and relay chain configurations. Always refer to the most current documentation for your particular network setup.

After successfully submitting the XCM message to the relay chain, two HRMP channels should be created, establishing bidirectional communication between parachain 2500 and system chain 1000. To verify this, follow these steps:

1. Using Polkadot.js Apps, connect to the relay chain and navigate to the **Developer** dropdown, then select **Chain state**
    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/hrmp-channels-1.webp)

2. Query the HRMP channels
    1. Select **`hrmp`** from the options
    2. Choose the **`hrmpChannels`** call
    3. Click the **+** button to execute the query
    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/para-to-system/hrmp-para-to-system-3.webp)
    
3. Examine the query results. You should see output similar to the following:
    ```json
    [
    [
        [
            {
                "sender": 1000,
                "recipient": 2500
            }
        ],
        {
            "maxCapacity": 8,
            "maxTotalSize": 8192,
            "maxMessageSize": 1048576,
            "msgCount": 0,
            "totalSize": 0,
            "mqcHead": null,
            "senderDeposit": 0,
            "recipientDeposit": 0
        }
    ],
    [
        [
            {
                "sender": 2500,
                "recipient": 1000
            }
        ],
        {
            "maxCapacity": 8,
            "maxTotalSize": 8192,
            "maxMessageSize": 1048576,
            "msgCount": 0,
            "totalSize": 0,
            "mqcHead": null,
            "senderDeposit": 0,
            "recipientDeposit": 0
        }
    ]
]
    ```

The output confirms the successful establishment of two HRMP channels:

- From chain 1000 (system chain) to chain 2500 (parachain)
- From chain 2500 (parachain) to chain 1000 (system chain)

This bidirectional channel enables direct communication between the system chain and the parachain, allowing for cross-chain message passing.

description: Learn how to perform a reserve-backed asset transfer between a relay chain and a parachain using XCM for cross-chain interoperability.

# From Relay Chain to Parachain

## Introduction

[Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)](/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank} facilitates asset transfers both within the same consensus system and between different ones, such as between a relay chain and its parachains. For cross-system transfers, two main methods are available:

- [**Asset teleportation**](https://paritytech.github.io/xcm-docs/journey/transfers/teleports.html){target=\_blank} - a simple and efficient method involving only the source and destination chains, ideal for systems with a high level of trust
- [**Reserve-backed transfers**](https://paritytech.github.io/xcm-docs/journey/transfers/reserve.html){target=\_blank} - involves a trusted reserve holding real assets and mints derivative tokens to track ownership. This method is suited for systems with lower trust levels

In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform a reserve-backed transfer of DOT between a relay chain (Polkadot) and a parachain (Astar).

## Prerequisites

When adapting this tutorial for other chains, before you can send messages between different consensus systems, you must first open HRMP channels. For detailed guidance, refer to the [XCM Channels](/develop/interoperability/xcm-channels/#xcm-channels){target=\_blank} article before for further information about.

This tutorial uses Chopsticks to fork a relay chain and a parachain connected via HRMP channels. For more details on this setup, see the [XCM Testing](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/#xcm-testing){target=\_blank} section on the Chopsticks page.

## Setup

To simulate XCM operations between different consensus systems, start by forking the network with the following command:

```bash
chopsticks xcm -r polkadot -p astar
```
After executing this command, the relay chain and parachain will expose the following WebSocket endpoints:

| Chain                  | WebSocket Endpoint                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Polkadot (relay chain) | <pre>```ws://localhost:8001```</pre> |
| Astar (parachain)      | <pre>```ws://localhost:8000```</pre> |

You can perform the reserve-backed transfer using either the [Polkadot.js Apps interface](#using-polkadotjs-apps) or the [Polkadot API](#using-papi), depending on your preference. Both methods provide the same functionality to facilitate asset transfers between the relay chain and parachain.

## Use Polkadot.js Apps

Open two browser tabs and can connect these endpoints using the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface:

a. Add the custom endpoint for each chain

b. Click **Switch** to connect to the respective network

![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-transfers/from-relaychain-to-parachain/from-relaychain-to-parachain-01.webp)

This reserve-backed transfer method facilitates asset transfers from a local chain to a destination chain by trusting a third party called a reserve to store the real assets. Fees on the destination chain are deducted from the asset specified in the assets vector at the `fee_asset_item` index, covering up to the specified `weight_limit.` The operation fails if the required weight exceeds this limit, potentially putting the transferred assets at risk.

The following steps outline how to execute a reserve-backed transfer from the Polkadot relay chain to the Astar parachain.

### From the Relay Chain Perspective

1. Navigate to the Extrinsics page
    1. Click on the **Developer** tab from the top navigation bar
    2. Select **Extrinsics** from the dropdown

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-transfers/from-relaychain-to-parachain/from-relaychain-to-parachain-02.webp)

2. Select **xcmPallet**

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-transfers/from-relaychain-to-parachain/from-relaychain-to-parachain-03.webp)

3. Select the **limitedReservedAssetTransfer** extrinsic from the dropdown list

    ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-transfers/from-relaychain-to-parachain/from-relaychain-to-parachain-04.webp)

4. Fill out the required fields:
    1. **dest** - specifies the destination context for the assets. Commonly set to `[Parent, Parachain(..)]` for parachain-to-parachain transfers or `[Parachain(..)]` for relay chain-to-parachain transfers. In this case, since the transfer is from a relay chain to a parachain, the destination ([`Location`](https://paritytech.github.io/xcm-docs/fundamentals/multilocation/index.html){target=\_blank}) is the following:

        ```bash
        { parents: 0, interior: { X1: [{ Parachain: 2006 }] } }
        ```

    3. **beneficiary** - defines the recipient of the assets within the destination context, typically represented as an `AccountId32` value. This example uses the following account present in the destination chain:


        ```bash
        X2mE9hCGX771c3zzV6tPa8U2cDz4U4zkqUdmBrQn83M3cm7
        ```

    4. **assets** - lists the assets to be withdrawn, including those designated for fee payment on the destination chain
    5. **feeAssetItem** - indicates the index of the asset within the assets list to be used for paying fees
    6. **weightLimit** - specifies the weight limit, if applicable, for the fee payment on the remote chain
    7. Click on the **Submit Transaction** button to send the transaction

        ![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-transfers/from-relaychain-to-parachain/from-relaychain-to-parachain-05.webp)

After submitting the transaction, verify that the `xcmPallet.FeesPaid` and `xcmPallet.Sent` events have been emitted:

![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-transfers/from-relaychain-to-parachain/from-relaychain-to-parachain-06.webp)

### From the Parachain Perspective

After submitting the transaction from the relay chain, confirm its success by checking the parachain's events. Look for the `assets.Issued` event, which verifies that the assets have been issued to the destination as expected:

![](/images/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-transfers/from-relaychain-to-parachain/from-relaychain-to-parachain-07.webp)

## Use PAPI

To programmatically execute the reserve-backed asset transfer between the relay chain and the parachain, you can use [Polkadot API (PAPI)](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/papi/){target=\_blank}. PAPI is a robust toolkit that simplifies interactions with Polkadot-based chains. For this project, you'll first need to set up your environment, install necessary dependencies, and create a script to handle the transfer process.

1. Start by creating a folder for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir reserve-backed-asset-transfer
   cd reserve-backed-asset
   ```

2. Initialize a Node.js project and install the required dependencies. Execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm init
    npm install polkadot-api @polkadot-labs/hdkd @polkadot-labs/hdkd-helpers
    ```

3. To enable static, type-safe APIs for interacting with the Polkadot and Astar chains, add their metadata to your project using PAPI:

    ```bash
    npx papi add dot -n polkadot
    npx papi add astar -w wss://rpc.astar.network
    ```

    !!! note 
        - `dot` and `astar` are arbitrary names you assign to the chains, allowing you to access their metadata information
        - The first command uses the well-known Polkadot chain, while the second connects to the Astar chain using its WebSocket endpoint

4. Create a `index.js` file and insert the following code to configure the clients and handle the asset transfer

    ```js
    // Import necessary modules from Polkadot API and helpers
import {
  astar, // Astar chain metadata
  dot, // Polkadot chain metadata
  XcmVersionedLocation,
  XcmVersionedAssets,
  XcmV3Junction,
  XcmV3Junctions,
  XcmV3WeightLimit,
  XcmV3MultiassetFungibility,
  XcmV3MultiassetAssetId,
} from '@polkadot-api/descriptors';
import { createClient } from 'polkadot-api';
import { sr25519CreateDerive } from '@polkadot-labs/hdkd';
import {
  DEV_PHRASE,
  entropyToMiniSecret,
  mnemonicToEntropy,
  ss58Decode,
} from '@polkadot-labs/hdkd-helpers';
import { getPolkadotSigner } from 'polkadot-api/signer';
import { getWsProvider } from 'polkadot-api/ws-provider/web';
import { withPolkadotSdkCompat } from 'polkadot-api/polkadot-sdk-compat';
import { Binary } from 'polkadot-api';

// Create Polkadot client using WebSocket provider for Polkadot chain
const polkadotClient = createClient(
  withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('ws://127.0.0.1:8001')),
);
const dotApi = polkadotClient.getTypedApi(dot);

// Create Astar client using WebSocket provider for Astar chain
const astarClient = createClient(
  withPolkadotSdkCompat(getWsProvider('ws://localhost:8000')),
);
const astarApi = astarClient.getTypedApi(astar);

// Create keypair for Alice using dev phrase to sign transactions
const miniSecret = entropyToMiniSecret(mnemonicToEntropy(DEV_PHRASE));
const derive = sr25519CreateDerive(miniSecret);
const aliceKeyPair = derive('//Alice');
const alice = getPolkadotSigner(
  aliceKeyPair.publicKey,
  'Sr25519',
  aliceKeyPair.sign,
);

// Define recipient (Dave) address on Astar chain
const daveAddress = 'X2mE9hCGX771c3zzV6tPa8U2cDz4U4zkqUdmBrQn83M3cm7';
const davePublicKey = ss58Decode(daveAddress)[0];
const idBenef = Binary.fromBytes(davePublicKey);

// Define Polkadot Asset ID on Astar chain (example)
const polkadotAssetId = 340282366920938463463374607431768211455n;

// Fetch asset balance of recipient (Dave) before transaction
let assetMetadata = await astarApi.query.Assets.Account.getValue(
  polkadotAssetId,
  daveAddress,
);
console.log('Asset balance before tx:', assetMetadata?.balance ?? 0);

// Prepare and submit transaction to transfer assets from Polkadot to Astar
const tx = dotApi.tx.XcmPallet.limited_reserve_transfer_assets({
  dest: XcmVersionedLocation.V3({
    parents: 0,
    interior: XcmV3Junctions.X1(
      XcmV3Junction.Parachain(2006), // Destination is the Astar parachain
    ),
  }),
  beneficiary: XcmVersionedLocation.V3({
    parents: 0,
    interior: XcmV3Junctions.X1(
      XcmV3Junction.AccountId32({
        // Beneficiary address on Astar
        network: undefined,
        id: idBenef,
      }),
    ),
  }),
  assets: XcmVersionedAssets.V3([
    {
      id: XcmV3MultiassetAssetId.Concrete({
        parents: 0,
        interior: XcmV3Junctions.Here(), // Asset from the sender's location
      }),
      fun: XcmV3MultiassetFungibility.Fungible(120000000000), // Asset amount to transfer
    },
  ]),
  fee_asset_item: 0, // Asset used to pay transaction fees
  weight_limit: XcmV3WeightLimit.Unlimited(), // No weight limit on transaction
});

// Sign and submit the transaction
tx.signSubmitAndWatch(alice).subscribe({
  next: async (event) => {
    if (event.type === 'finalized') {
      console.log('Transaction completed successfully');
    }
  },
  error: console.error,
  complete() {
    polkadotClient.destroy(); // Clean up after transaction
  },
});

// Wait for transaction to complete
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 20000));

// Fetch asset balance of recipient (Dave) after transaction
assetMetadata = await astarApi.query.Assets.Account.getValue(
  polkadotAssetId,
  daveAddress,
);
console.log('Asset balance after tx:', assetMetadata?.balance ?? 0);

// Exit the process
process.exit(0);
    ```

    !!! note
        To use this script with real-world blockchains, you'll need to update the WebSocket endpoint to the appropriate one, replace the Alice account with a valid account, and ensure the account has sufficient funds to cover transaction fees.

4. Execute the script 

    ```bash 
    node index.js
    ```

5. Check the terminal output. If the operation is successful, you should see the following message:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>node index.js</span>
  <span data-ty> Asset balance before tx: 0</span>
  <span data-ty> Transaction completed successfully</span>
  <span data-ty> Asset balance after tx: 119999114907n</span>
</div>

## Additional Resources

You can perform these operations using the Asset Transfer API for an alternative approach. Refer to the [Asset Transfer API](/develop/toolkit/interoperability/asset-transfer-api/){target=\_blank} guide in the documentation for more details.

# Fast Track a Governance Proposal

## Introduction

Polkadot's [OpenGov](/polkadot-protocol/onchain-governance/overview){target=\_blank} is a sophisticated governance mechanism designed to allow the network to evolve gracefully over time, guided by its stakeholders. This system features multiple [tracks](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#origins-and-tracks-info){target=\_blank} for different types of proposals, each with parameters for approval, support, and confirmation period. While this flexibility is powerful, it also introduces complexity that can lead to failed proposals or unexpected outcomes.

Testing governance proposals before submission is crucial for the ecosystem. This process enhances efficiency by reducing the need for repeated submissions, improves security by identifying potential risks, and allows proposal optimization based on simulated outcomes. It also serves as an educational tool, providing stakeholders with a safe environment to understand the impacts of different voting scenarios. 

By leveraging simulation tools like [Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks){target=\_blank}, developers can:

- Simulate the entire lifecycle of a proposal
- Test the voting outcomes by varying the support and approval levels
- Analyze the effects of a successfully executed proposal on the network's state
- Identify and troubleshoot potential issues or unexpected consequences before submitting the proposals

This tutorial will guide you through using Chopsticks to test OpenGov proposals thoroughly. This ensures that when you submit a proposal to the live network, you can do so with confidence in its effects and viability.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Chopsticks installation** - if you have not installed Chopsticks yet, refer to the [Install Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/#install-chopsticks){target=\_blank} guide for detailed instructions
- **Familiarity with key concepts** - you should have a basic understanding of the following:
    - [Polkadot.js](/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/polkadot-js-api){target=\_blank} 
    - [OpenGov](/polkadot-protocol/onchain-governance/overview){target=\_blank}

## Set Up the Project

Before testing OpenGov proposals, you need to set up your development environment. 
You'll set up a TypeScript project and install the required dependencies to simulate and evaluate proposals. You'll use Chopsticks to fork the Polkadot network and simulate the proposal lifecycle, while Polkadot.js will be your interface for interacting with the forked network and submitting proposals.

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Create a new project directory and navigate into it:
    ```bash
    mkdir opengov-chopsticks && cd opengov-chopsticks
    ```

2. Initialize a new TypeScript project:
    ```bash
    npm init -y \
    && npm install typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev \
    && npx tsc --init
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install @polkadot/api @acala-network/chopsticks
    ```

4. Create a new TypeScript file for your script:
    ```bash
    touch test-proposal.ts
    ```

    !!!note
        You'll write your code to simulate and test OpenGov proposals in the `test-proposal.ts` file.

5. Open the `tsconfig.json` file and ensure it includes these compiler options:
    ```json
    {
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "CommonJS",
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "target": "esnext",
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "declaration": true,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "outDir": "dist",
        "composite": true
    }
}
    ```

## Submit and Execute a Proposal Using Chopsticks

You should identify the right track and origin for your proposal. For example, select the appropriate treasury track based on the spending limits if you're requesting funds from the treasury. For more detailed information, refer to [Polkadot OpenGov Origins](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins){target=\_blank}.

!!!note
    This tutorial will focus on the main steps and core logic within the main function. For clarity and conciseness, the implementation details of individual functions will be available in expandable tabs below each section. You'll find the complete code for reference at the end of the tutorial.

### Spin Up the Polkadot Fork

To set up your Polkadot fork using Chopsticks, open a new terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=polkadot
```

This command will start a local fork of the Polkadot network accessible at `ws://localhost:8000`. Keep this terminal window open and running throughout your testing process.

Once your forked network is up and running, you can proceed with the following steps.

### Set Up Dependencies and Structure

Begin by adding the necessary imports and a basic structure to the `test-proposal.ts` file:

```typescript
// --8<-- [start:imports]
import '@polkadot/api-augment/polkadot';
import { FrameSupportPreimagesBounded } from '@polkadot/types/lookup';
import { blake2AsHex } from '@polkadot/util-crypto';
import { ApiPromise, Keyring, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';
import { type SubmittableExtrinsic } from '@polkadot/api/types';
import { ISubmittableResult } from '@polkadot/types/types';
// --8<-- [end:imports]

// --8<-- [start:connectToFork]
/**
 * Establishes a connection to the local forked chain.
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an `ApiPromise` instance connected to the local chain.
 */
async function connectToFork(): Promise<ApiPromise> {
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('ws://localhost:8000');
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });
  await api.isReady;
  console.log(`Connected to chain: ${await api.rpc.system.chain()}`);
  return api;
}
// --8<-- [end:connectToFork]

// --8<-- [start:generateProposal]
/**
 * Generates a proposal by submitting a preimage, creating the proposal, and placing a deposit.
 *
 * @param api - An instance of the Polkadot.js API promise used to interact with the blockchain.

Inside the `main` function, add the code to establish a connection to your local Polkadot fork:

```typescript hl_lines="2-3"
// Connect to the forked chain
  const api = await connectToFork();
  ...
}
```

### Create and Submit the Proposal

Create a `generateProposal` function that will be responsible for preparing and submitting the on-chain proposal:

```typescript
api: ApiPromise,
  call: SubmittableExtrinsic<'promise', ISubmittableResult>,
  origin: any
): Promise<number> {
    ...
}
```

Now, you need to implement the following logic:

1. Set up the keyring and use the Alice development account

    ```typescript
    const keyring = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' });

  // Set up Alice development account
  const alice = keyring.addFromUri('//Alice');
    ```
 
    !!!note
        When using Chopsticks, this development account is pre-funded to execute all necessary actions.

2. Retrieve the proposal index

    ```typescript
    const proposalIndex = (
    await api.query.referenda.referendumCount()
  ).toNumber();
    ```

3. Execute a batch transaction that comprises the following three operations:
    1. **`preimage.notePreimage`** - registers a [preimage](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#preimage){target=\_blank} using the selected call

        !!!note
            The preimage hash is simply the hash of the proposal to be enacted. The on-chain proposals do not require the entire image of extrinsics and data (for instance, the Wasm code, in case of upgrades) to be submitted but would need that image's hash. That preimage can be submitted and stored on-chain against the hash later upon the proposal's dispatch.

    2. **`referenda.submit`** - submits the proposal to the referenda system. It uses the preimage hash extracted from the call as part of the proposal submission process. The proposal is submitted with the selected origin

    3. **`referenda.placeDecisionDeposit`** - places the required decision deposit for the referendum. This deposit is required to move the referendum from the preparing phase to the deciding phase

    ```typescript
    await new Promise<void>(async (resolve) => {
    const unsub = await api.tx.utility
      .batch([
        // Register the preimage for your proposal
        api.tx.preimage.notePreimage(call.method.toHex()),
        // Submit your proposal to the referenda system
        api.tx.referenda.submit(
          origin as any,
          {
            Lookup: {
              Hash: call.method.hash.toHex(),
              len: call.method.encodedLength,
            },
          },
          { At: 0 }
        ),
        // Place the required decision deposit
        api.tx.referenda.placeDecisionDeposit(proposalIndex),
      ])
      .signAndSend(alice, (status: any) => {
        if (status.blockNumber) {
          unsub();
          resolve();
        }
      });
  });
    ```

4. Return the proposal index:

    ```typescript
    
    ```

If you followed all the steps correctly, the function should look like this:

!!!note
    The [`setCodeWithoutChecks`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.set_code_without_checks){target=\_blank} extrinsic used in this example is for demonstration purposes only. Replace it with the specific extrinsic that matches your governance proposal's intended functionality. Ensure the call matches your target Polkadot SDK-based network's runtime requirements and governance process.

### Force Proposal Execution

After submitting your proposal, you can test its execution by directly manipulating the chain state and scheduler using Chopsticks, bypassing the standard voting and enactment periods.

Create a new function called `forceProposalExecution`:

```typescript

  ...
}
```

This function will accomplish two primary objectives:

- Modify the chain storage to set the proposal's approvals and support artificially, ensuring its passage
- Override the scheduler to execute the proposal immediately in the subsequent blocks, circumventing standard waiting periods

Implement the functionality through the following steps:

1. Get the referendum information and its hash:
    ```typescript
    const referendumData = await api.query.referenda.referendumInfoFor(
    proposalIndex
  );
  // Get the storage key for the referendum data
  const referendumKey =
    api.query.referenda.referendumInfoFor.key(proposalIndex);

  // Check if the referendum data exists
  if (!referendumData.isSome) {
    throw new Error(`Referendum ${proposalIndex} not found`);
  }

  const referendumInfo = referendumData.unwrap();

  // Check if the referendum is in an ongoing state
  if (!referendumInfo.isOngoing) {
    throw new Error(`Referendum ${proposalIndex} is not ongoing`);
  }

  // Get the ongoing referendum data
  const ongoingData = referendumInfo.asOngoing;
  // Convert the ongoing data to JSON
  const ongoingJson = ongoingData.toJSON();

  // Support Lookup, Inline or Legacy proposals
  const callHash = ongoingData.proposal.isLookup
    ? ongoingData.proposal.asLookup.toHex()
    : ongoingData.proposal.isInline
    ? blake2AsHex(ongoingData.proposal.asInline.toHex())
    : ongoingData.proposal.asLegacy.toHex();
    ```

2. Determine the total amount of existing native tokens:
    ```typescript
    const totalIssuance = (await api.query.balances.totalIssuance()).toBigInt();
    ```

3. Fetch the current block number:
    ```typescript
    const proposalBlockTarget = (
    await api.rpc.chain.getHeader()
  ).number.toNumber();
    ```

4. Modify the proposal data and overwrite the storage:
    ```typescript
    const fastProposalData = {
    ongoing: {
      ...ongoingJson,
      enactment: { after: 0 },
      deciding: {
        since: proposalBlockTarget - 1,
        confirming: proposalBlockTarget - 1,
      },
      tally: {
        ayes: totalIssuance - 1n,
        nays: 0,
        support: totalIssuance - 1n,
      },
      alarm: [proposalBlockTarget + 1, [proposalBlockTarget + 1, 0]],
    },
  };

  // Create a new proposal object from the proposal data

## Execute the Proposal Script

To run the proposal execution script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ts-node test-proposal.ts
```

When executing the script, you should expect the following key actions and outputs:

- **Chain forking** - the script connects to a forked version of the Polkadot network, allowing safe manipulation of the chain state without affecting the live network.

- **Proposal generation** - a new governance proposal is created using the specified extrinsic (in this example, `setCodeWithoutChecks`)

- **State manipulation** - the referendum's storage is modified to simulate immediate approval by adjusting tally and support values to force proposal passing. Scheduled calls are then redirected to ensure immediate execution

- **Execution** - the script advances the chain to trigger the scheduled call execution. The specified call (e.g., `setCodeWithoutChecks`) is processed

## Summary

In this tutorial, you've learned how to use Chopsticks to test OpenGov proposals on a local fork of the Polkadot network. You've set up a TypeScript project, connected to a local fork, submitted a proposal, and forced its execution for testing purposes. This process allows you to:

- Safely experiment with different types of proposals
- Test the effects of proposals without affecting the live network
- Rapidly iterate and debug your governance ideas

Using these techniques, you can develop and refine your proposals before submitting them to the Polkadot network, ensuring they're well-tested and likely to achieve their intended effects.

title: Add Pallets to the Runtime
description: Add pallets to your runtime for custom functionality. Learn to configure and integrate pallets in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains.
---

# Add Pallets to the Runtime

## Introduction

In previous tutorials, you learned how to [create a custom pallet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/build-custom-pallet/){target=\_blank} and [test it](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/pallet-unit-testing/){target=\_blank}. The next step is to include this pallet in your runtime, integrating it into the core logic of your blockchain.

This tutorial will guide you through adding two pallets to your runtime: the custom pallet you previously developed and the [utility pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_utility/index.html){target=\_blank}. This standard Polkadot SDK pallet provides powerful dispatch functionality. The utility pallet offers, for example, batch dispatch, a stateless operation that enables executing multiple calls in a single transaction.

## Add the Pallets as Dependencies

First, you'll update the runtime's `Cargo.toml` file to include the Utility pallet and your custom pallets as dependencies for the runtime. Follow these steps:

Update the runtime's `Cargo.toml` file to include the utility pallet and your custom pallets as dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `runtime/Cargo.toml` file and locate the `[dependencies]` section. Add the pallets with the following lines:

    ```toml hl_lines="3-4" title="Cargo.toml"
    
    ...
    custom-pallet = { path = "../pallets/custom-pallet", default-features = false }
    ```

2. In the `[features]` section, add the pallets to the `std` feature list:

    ```toml hl_lines="5-6" title="Cargo.toml"
    default = ["std"]
std = [
      ...
    "custom-pallet/std",
]
    ```

3. Save the changes and close the `Cargo.toml` file

### Update the Runtime Configuration

Configure the pallets by implementing their `Config` trait and update the runtime macro to include the new pallets:

1. Add the `OriginCaller` import:

    ```rust
    
    ```

2. Implement the [`Config`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_utility/pallet/trait.Config.html){target=\_blank} trait for both pallets at the end of the `runtime/src/config/mod.rs` file:

    ```rust title="mod.rs"
    impl pallet_utility::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type RuntimeCall = RuntimeCall;
    type PalletsOrigin = OriginCaller;
    type WeightInfo = pallet_utility::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
}

// Define counter max value runtime constant.
parameter_types! {
    pub const CounterMaxValue: u32 = 500;
}

// Configure custom pallet.
impl custom_pallet::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type CounterMaxValue = CounterMaxValue;
    
    ```

3. Locate the `#[frame_support::runtime]` macro in the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file and add the pallets:

    ```rust hl_lines="5-9" title="lib.rs"
    #[frame_support::runtime]
mod runtime {
        ...
    pub type Utility = pallet_utility;

    #[runtime::pallet_index(52)]
    pub type CustomPallet = custom_pallet;
}
    ```

## Recompile the Runtime

After adding and configuring your pallets in the runtime, the next step is to ensure everything is set up correctly. To do this, recompile the runtime using the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This command ensures the runtime compiles without errors, validates the pallet configurations, and prepares the build for subsequent testing or deployment.

## Run Your Chain Locally

Launch your parachain locally and start producing blocks:

!!!tip
    Generated chain TestNet specifications include development accounts "Alice" and "Bob." These accounts are pre-funded with native parachain currency, allowing you to sign and send TestNet transactions. Take a look at the [Polkadot.js Accounts section](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts){target=\_blank} to view the development accounts for your chain.

1. Create a new chain specification file with the updated runtime:

    ```bash
    chain-spec-builder create -t development \
    --relay-chain paseo \
    --para-id 1000 \
    --runtime ./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
    named-preset development
    ```

2. Start the omni node with the generated chain specification:

    ```bash
    polkadot-omni-node --chain ./chain_spec.json --dev
    ```

3. Verify you can interact with the new pallets using the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} interface. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** tab and check that you can see both pallets:

title: Build a Custom Pallet
description: Learn how to build a custom pallet for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains with this step-by-step guide. Create and configure a simple counter pallet from scratch.
---

# Build a Custom Pallet

## Introduction

In Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, runtime functionality is built through modular components called [pallets](/polkadot-protocol/glossary#pallet){target=\_blank}. These pallets are Rust-based runtime modules created using [FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modular Entities)](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/overview/){target=\_blank}, a powerful library that simplifies blockchain development by providing specialized macros and standardized patterns for building blockchain logic.
A pallet encapsulates a specific set of blockchain functionalities, such as managing token balances, implementing governance mechanisms, or creating custom state transitions.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a custom pallet from scratch. You will develop a simple counter pallet with the following features:

- Users can increment and decrement a counter
- Only a [root origin](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/type.Origin.html#variant.Root){target=\_blank} can set an arbitrary counter value

## Prerequisites

You'll use the [Polkadot SDK Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/parachain){target=\_blank} created in the [Set Up a Template](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/set-up-a-template/){target=\_blank} tutorial. 

## Create a New Project

In this tutorial, you'll build a custom pallet from scratch to demonstrate the complete workflow, rather than starting with the pre-built `pallet-template`. The first step is to create a new Rust package for your pallet:

1. Navigate to the `pallets` directory in your workspace:

    ```bash
    cd pallets
    ```

2. Create a new Rust library project for your custom pallet by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo new --lib custom-pallet
    ```

3. Enter the new project directory:

    ```bash
    cd custom-pallet
    ```

4. Ensure the project was created successfully by checking its structure. The file layout should resemble the following:

    ```
    custom-pallet 
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── lib.rs
    ```

    If the files are in place, your project setup is complete, and you're ready to start building your custom pallet.

To build and integrate your custom pallet into a Polkadot SDK-based runtime, you must add specific dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file of your pallet's project. These dependencies provide essential modules and features required for pallet development. Since your custom pallet is part of a workspace that includes other components, such as the runtime, the configuration must align with the workspace structure. Follow the steps below to set up your `Cargo.toml` file properly:

1. Open your `Cargo.toml` file

2. Add the required dependencies in the `[dependencies]` section:

    ```toml
    codec = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
scale-info = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
frame-support.workspace = true
frame-system.workspace = true
    ```

3. Enable `std` features:

    ```toml
    default = ["std"]
std = [
  "codec/std",
  "frame-support/std",
  "frame-system/std",
  "scale-info/std",
    
    ```

The final `Cargo.toml` file should resemble the following:

??? code "Cargo.toml"

    ```toml
    [package]
name = "custom-pallet"
version = "0.1.0"
license.workspace = true
authors.workspace = true
homepage.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true

[dependencies]
codec = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
scale-info = { features = ["derive"], workspace = true }
frame-support.workspace = true
frame-system.workspace = true
frame-benchmarking = { optional = true, workspace = true }

[dev-dependencies]
sp-core = { workspace = true, default-features = true }
sp-io = { workspace = true, default-features = true }
sp-runtime = { workspace = true, default-features = true }

[features]
default = ["std"]
std = [
  "codec/std",
  "frame-support/std",
  "frame-system/std",
  "scale-info/std",
  "frame-benchmarking?/std",
]
runtime-benchmarks = [
  "frame-benchmarking/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-support/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-system/runtime-benchmarks",
  "sp-runtime/runtime-benchmarks",
]
try-runtime = []

    default = ["std"]
std = [
  "codec/std",
  "frame-support/std",
  "frame-system/std",
  "scale-info/std",
    
    ```

## Implement the Pallet Logic

In this section, you will construct the core structure of your custom pallet, starting with setting up its basic scaffold. This scaffold acts as the foundation, enabling you to later add functionality such as storage items, events, errors, and dispatchable calls.

### Add Scaffold Pallet Structure

You now have the bare minimum of package dependencies that your pallet requires specified in the `Cargo.toml` file. The next step is to prepare the scaffolding for your new pallet.

1. Open `src/lib.rs` in a text editor and delete all the content
   
2. Prepare the scaffolding for the pallet by adding the following:

    ```rust title="lib.rs"
    pub use pallet::*;
    pub mod pallet {
    use super::*;
    use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
    use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

    #[pallet::pallet]
    pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

    // Configuration trait for the pallet.
    #[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        
    
    ```

3. Verify that it compiles by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo build --package custom-pallet
    ```

### Pallet Configuration

Implementing the `#[pallet::config]` macro is mandatory and sets the module's dependency on other modules and the types and values specified by the runtime-specific settings.

In this step, you will configure two essential components that are critical for the pallet's functionality:

- **`RuntimeEvent`** - since this pallet emits events, the [`RuntimeEvent`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.RuntimeEvent){target=\_blank} type is required to handle them. This ensures that events generated by the pallet can be correctly processed and interpreted by the runtime

- **`CounterMaxValue`** - a constant that sets an upper limit on the value of the counter, ensuring that the counter remains within a predefined range

Add the following `Config` trait definition to your pallet:

```rust title="lib.rs"
#[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        // Defines the event type for the pallet.
        type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

        // Defines the maximum value the counter can hold.
        #[pallet::constant]
        type CounterMaxValue: Get<u32>;

```

### Add Events

Events allow the pallet to communicate with the outside world by emitting signals when specific actions occur. These events are critical for transparency, debugging, and integration with external systems such as UIs or monitoring tools.

Below are the events defined for this pallet:

- **`CounterValueSet`** - is emitted when the counter is explicitly set to a new value. This event includes the counter's updated value

- **`CounterIncremented`** - is emitted after a successful increment operation. It includes:

    - The new counter value
    - The account responsible for the increment
    - The amount by which the counter was incremented

- **`CounterDecremented`** - is emitted after a successful decrement operation. It includes:

    - The new counter value
    - The account responsible for the decrement
    - The amount by which the counter was decremented

Define the events in the pallet as follows:

```rust title="lib.rs"
#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
    pub enum Event<T: Config> {
        /// The counter value has been set to a new value by Root.
        CounterValueSet {
            /// The new value set.
            counter_value: u32,
        },
        /// A user has successfully incremented the counter.
        CounterIncremented {
            /// The new value set.
            counter_value: u32,
            /// The account who incremented the counter.
            who: T::AccountId,
            /// The amount by which the counter was incremented.
            incremented_amount: u32,
        },
        /// A user has successfully decremented the counter.
        CounterDecremented {
            /// The new value set.
            counter_value: u32,
            /// The account who decremented the counter.
            who: T::AccountId,
            /// The amount by which the counter was decremented.
            decremented_amount: u32,
        },
    }
```

### Add Storage Items

Storage items are used to manage the pallet's state. This pallet defines two items to handle the counter's state and user interactions:

- **`CounterValue`** - a single storage value that keeps track of the current value of the counter. This value is the core state variable manipulated by the pallet's functions

- **`UserInteractions`** - a storage map that tracks the number of times each account interacts with the counter
  
Define the storage items as follows:

```rust title="lib.rs"
#[pallet::storage]
    pub type CounterValue<T> = StorageValue<_, u32>;

    /// Storage map to track the number of interactions performed by each account.
    #[pallet::storage]
    pub type UserInteractions<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Twox64Concat, T::AccountId, u32>;
```

### Implement Custom Errors

The `#[pallet::error]` macro defines a custom `Error` enum to handle specific failure conditions within the pallet. Errors help provide meaningful feedback to users and external systems when an extrinsic cannot be completed successfully. They are critical for maintaining the pallet's clarity and robustness.

To add custom errors, use the `#[pallet::error]` macro to define the `Error` enum. Each variant represents a unique error that the pallet can emit, and these errors should align with the logic and constraints of the pallet. 

Add the following errors to the pallet:

```rust title="lib.rs"
pub enum Error<T> {
        /// The counter value exceeds the maximum allowed value.
        CounterValueExceedsMax,
        /// The counter value cannot be decremented below zero.
        CounterValueBelowZero,
        /// Overflow occurred in the counter.
        CounterOverflow,
        /// Overflow occurred in user interactions.
        UserInteractionOverflow,
    }
```

### Implement Calls

The `#[pallet::call]` macro defines the dispatchable functions (or calls) the pallet exposes. These functions allow users or the runtime to interact with the pallet's logic and state. Each call includes comprehensive validations, modifies the state, and optionally emits events to signal successful execution.

The structure of the dispatchable calls in this pallet is as follows:

```rust title="lib.rs"
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
        /// Set the value of the counter.
        ///
        /// The dispatch origin of this call must be _Root_.
        ///
        /// - `new_value`: The new value to set for the counter.
        ///
        /// Emits `CounterValueSet` event when successful.
        #[pallet::call_index(0)]
    #[pallet::weight(0)]
    
    

    ///
        /// This function can be called by any signed account.
        ///
        /// - `amount_to_increment`: The amount by which to increment the counter.
        ///
        /// Emits `CounterIncremented` event when successful.
        #[pallet::call_index(1)]
    #[pallet::weight(0)]
    
    

    ///
        /// This function can be called by any signed account.
        ///
        /// - `amount_to_decrement`: The amount by which to decrement the counter.
        ///
        /// Emits `CounterDecremented` event when successful.
        #[pallet::call_index(2)]
    #[pallet::weight(0)]
    
    

```

## Verify Compilation

After implementing all the pallet components, verifying that the code still compiles successfully is crucial. Run the following command in your terminal to ensure there are no errors:

```bash
cargo build --package custom-pallet
```

If you encounter any errors or warnings, carefully review your code to resolve the issues. Once the build is complete without errors, your pallet implementation is ready.

## Key Takeaways

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a custom pallet by defining storage, implementing errors, adding dispatchable calls, and emitting events. These are the foundational building blocks for developing robust Polkadot SDK-based blockchain logic.

# Deploy on Paseo TestNet

## Introduction

Previously, you learned how to [build and run a blockchain locally](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/){target=\_blank}. Now, you'll take the next step towards a production-like environment by deploying your parachain to a public test network.

This tutorial guides you through deploying a parachain on the Paseo network, a public TestNet that provides a more realistic blockchain ecosystem. While public testnets have a higher barrier to entry compared to private networks, they are crucial for validating your parachain's functionality and preparing it for eventual mainnet deployment.

## Get Started with an Account and Tokens

To perform any action on Paseo, you need PAS tokens, which can be requested from the [Polkadot Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. To store the tokens, you must have access to a Substrate-compatible wallet. Go to the [Wallets and Extensions](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/wallets-and-extensions){target=\_blank} page on the Polkadot Wiki to view different options for a wallet, or use the [Polkadot.js browser extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/){target=\_blank}, which is suitable for development purposes.

!!!warning 
    Development keys and accounts should never hold assets of actual value and should not be used for production.

The [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface can be used to get you started for testing purposes.

To prepare an account, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface and connect to the Paseo network. Alternatively use this link to connect directly to Paseo: [Polkadot.js Apps: Paseo](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://paseo.dotters.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-1.webp)

2. Navigate to the **Accounts** section
    1. Click on the **Accounts** tab in the top menu
    2. Select the **Accounts** option from the dropdown menu
  
    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-2.webp)

3. Copy the address of the account you want to use for the parachain deployment

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-3.webp)

4. Visit the [Polkadot Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io){target=\_blank} and paste the copied address in the input field. Ensure that the network is set to Paseo and click on the **Get some PASs** button

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-4.webp)

    After a few seconds, you will receive 5000 PAS tokens in your account.

## Reserve a Parachain Identifier

You must reserve a parachain identifier (ID) before registering your parachain on Paseo. You'll be assigned the next available identifier.

To reserve a parachain identifier, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Parachains** section
    1. Click on the **Network** tab in the top menu
    2. Select the **Parachains** option from the dropdown menu

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-5.webp)

2. Register a ParaId
    1. Select the **Parathreads** tab
    2. Click on the **+ ParaId** button

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-6.webp)

3. Review the transaction and click on the **+ Submit** button

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-7.webp)

    For this case, the next available parachain identifier is `4508`.

4. After submitting the transaction, you can navigate to the **Explorer** tab and check the list of recent events for successful `registrar.Reserved`

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-8.webp)

## Generate the Chain Specification

The files required to register a parachain must specify the correct relay chain to connect to and the parachain identifier you have been assigned. To make these changes, you must build and modify the chain specification file for your parachain. In this tutorial, the relay chain is `paseo`, and the parachain identifier is `4508`.

To modify the chain specification:

1. Generate the plain chain specification for the parachain template node by running the following command. Make sure to use the `*.compact.compressed.wasm` version of your file when generating your chain specification. You should find your runtime's Wasm file inside `target/release/wbuild`:

    ```bash
    chain-spec-builder create --relay-chain paseo \
    --para-id 4508 \
    -r <runtime.compact.compressed.wasm> \
    default
    ```

2. Open the plain text chain specification for the parachain template node in a text editor

3. Set the `parachainId` to the parachain identifier that you previously reserved:

    ```json
    {
    "...": "...",
    "relay_chain": "paseo",
    "para_id": 4508,
    "genesis": {
        "runtime": {
            "...": {},
            "parachainInfo": {
                "parachainId": 4508
            },
            "session": {
                "keys": [
                    [
                        "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj",
                        "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj",
                        {
                            "aura": "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj"
                        }
                    ]
                ]
            }
        },
        "...": {}
    }
}
    "runtime": {
            "...": {},
            "parachainInfo": {
                "parachainId": 4508
            },
    "...": {}
    }
}
    ```

4. Add the public key for your account to the session keys section. Each configured session key will require a running collator:

    ```json
    {
    "...": "...",
    "relay_chain": "paseo",
    "para_id": 4508,
    "genesis": {
        "runtime": {
            "...": {},
            "parachainInfo": {
                "parachainId": 4508
            },
            "session": {
                "keys": [
                    [
                        "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj",
                        "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj",
                        {
                            "aura": "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj"
                        }
                    ]
                ]
            }
        },
        "...": {}
    }
}
    "runtime": {
            "...": {},
    "keys": [
                    [
                        "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj",
                        "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj",
                        {
                            "aura": "5HErbKmL5JmUKDVsH1aGyXTGZb4i9iaNsFhSgkNDr8qp2Dvj"
                        }
                    ]
                ]
            }
        },
        "...": {}
    }
}
    ```

5. Save your changes and close the plain text chain specification file

6. Convert the modified plain chain specification file to a raw chain specification file:

    ```bash
    chain-spec-builder convert-to-raw plain-parachain-chainspec.json
    ```

    You should now see your chain specification containing SCALE-encoded hex values versus plain text.

## Export Required Files

To prepare the parachain collator to be registered on Paseo, follow these steps:

1. Export the Wasm runtime for the parachain by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    polkadot-omni-node export-genesis-wasm \
    --chain raw-parachain-chainspec.json para-wasm
    ```

2. Export the genesis state for the parachain by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    polkadot-omni-node export-genesis-state \
    --chain raw-parachain-chainspec.json para-state
    ```

## Register a Parathread

Once you have the genesis state and runtime, you can now register these with your parachain ID.

1. Go to the [Parachains > Parathreads](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/parathreads){target=\_blank} tab, and select **+ Parathread**
   
2. You should see fields to place your runtime Wasm and genesis state respectively, along with the parachain ID. Select your parachain ID, and upload `para-wasm` in the "code" field and `para-state` in the "initial state" field:

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-9.webp)
   
3. Confirm your details and **+ Submit** button, where there should be a new Parathread with your parachain ID and an active **Deregister** button:

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/deploy-to-testnet-10.webp)

Your parachain's runtime logic and genesis are now part of the relay chain. The next step is to ensure you are able to run a collator to produce blocks for your parachain.

## Start the Collator Node

Before starting a collator, generate a node key. A node key is responsible for communicating with other nodes over Libp2p:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node key generate-node-key \
--base-path /tmp/parachain/pubs-demo \
--chain raw-parachain-chainspec.json
```

After running the command, you should see the following output, indicating the base path now has a suitable node key: 

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>polkadot-omni-node key generate-node-key --base-path /tmp/parachain/pubs-demo --chain raw-parachain-chainspec.json</span>
  <br />
  <span data-ty="progress">2024-09-11 09:48:15 Building chain spec</span>
  <span data-ty="progress">Generating key in "/tmp/parachain/pubs-demo/chains/live/network/secret_ed25519"</span>
  <span data-ty="progress">12D3KooWJH816dWizsft7MXVrv1nH3dHnGsHxD1qdyQm9mMAbo7Z</span>
</div>

You must have the ports for the collator publicly accessible and discoverable to enable parachain nodes to peer with Paseo validator nodes to produce blocks. You can specify the ports with the `--port` command-line option. For example, you can start the collator with a command similar to the following:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --collator \
--chain raw-parachain-chainspec.json \
--base-path /tmp/parachain/pubs-demo \
--port 50333 \
--rpc-port 8855 \
-- \
--chain paseo \
--port 50343 \
--rpc-port 9988
```

In this example, the first `--port` setting specifies the port for the collator node and the second `--port` specifies the embedded relay chain node port. The first `--rpc-port` setting specifies the port you can connect to the collator. The second `--rpc-port` specifies the port for connecting to the embedded relay chain.

## Producing Blocks

With your parachain collator operational, the next step is acquiring coretime. This is essential for ensuring your parachain's security through the relay chain. [Agile Coretime](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-agile-coretime){target=\_blank} enhances Polkadot's resource management, offering developers greater economic adaptability. Once you have configured your parachain, you can follow two paths:

- Bulk coretime is purchased via the Broker pallet on the respective coretime system parachain. You can purchase bulk coretime on the coretime chain and assign the purchased core to the registered `ParaID`
- On-demand coretime is ordered via the `OnDemandAssignment` pallet, which is located on the respective relay chain

Once coretime is correctly assigned to your parachain, whether bulk or on-demand, blocks should be produced (provided your collator is running).

For more information on coretime, refer to the [Coretime](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/coretime/){target=\_blank} documentation.

description: Learn how to obtain coretime for block production with this guide, covering both on-demand and bulk options for smooth operations.
---

## Introduction

After deploying a parachain to the Paseo TestNet in the [Deploy to TestNet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/){target=\_blank} tutorial, the focus shifts to understanding Coretime, which is the mechanism in which validation resources are allocated from the relay chain to the respective task, such as a parachain. A parachain could only produce blocks and finalize them on the relay chain by obtaining coretime.

There are two ways to obtain coretime:

- **Bulk coretime** - bulk coretime allows you to obtain a core or part of a core. It is purchased for some time, up to 28 days. It must be renewed once the lease finishes
- **On-demand coretime** - on-demand coretime allows you to buy coretime on a block-by-block basis

In this tutorial, you will:

- Learn about the different coretime interfaces available
- Learn how to purchase a core via bulk coretime
- Assign a task / parachain to the core for block production
- Alternatively, use on-demand coretime to produce blocks as required

## Prerequisites 

Before proceeding, you should have the following items:

- A parachain ID
- A chain specification
- A registered parathread with the correct genesis, runtime, and parachain ID that matches the chain specification
- A properly configured and synced (with the relay chain) collator

Once the above is complete, obtaining coretime is the last step to enable your parachain to start producing and finalizing blocks using the relay chain's validator set. If you don't, refer to the previous tutorial: [Deploy on Paseo TestNet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/deploy-to-testnet/){target=\_blank}.

## Purchase Bulk Coretime

Purchasing bulk coretime involves purchasing a core from the [Coretime Chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/coretime/){target=\_blank}, which has an instance of [`pallet_broker`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_broker/index.html){target=\_blank} (the Broker pallet). Although this can be done via sending extrinsics through a tool like Polkadot.js Apps, there are user interfaces for purchasing and managing bulk coretime:

- [RegionX Coretime Marketplace (includes Paseo support)](https://app.regionx.tech){target=\_blank}
- [Lastic Coretime Marketplace](https://www.lastic.xyz/polkadot/bulkcore1){target=\_blank}
  
!!!tip
    Obtaining a core for bulk coretime on Paseo follows a different process from Polkadot or Kusama. To apply for a core on Paseo, visit their guide for doing so: [PAS-10 Onboard Paras Coretime](https://github.com/paseo-network/paseo-action-submission/blob/main/pas/PAS-10-Onboard-paras-coretime.md#summary){target=\_blank}. 

### Get Coretime Funds

First, ensure your wallet is connected to the [RegionX](https://app.regionx.tech){target=\_blank} interface. To do so, go to **Home** in the RegionX app and click the **Connect Wallet** button in the upper right.

After connecting your wallet, you must obtain funds on the Coretime chain. You can use the [RegionX Transfer](https://app.regionx.tech/transfer){target=\_blank} page to perform a cross-chain transfer from the relay to the system chain.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-1.webp)

If you are purchasing a core on a TestNet, be sure to visit the [Polkadot Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/westend){target=\_blank} for TestNet tokens.

If successful, you should see the balance in the upper right of the **Transfer** page update with balances on the relay and Coretime chain, respectively.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-2.webp)

### Purchase a Core

For this tutorial, we will use [RegionX](https://app.regionx.tech){target=\_blank}. Once you open the app, you should be presented with the following screen:

![Screenshot of the RegionX app displaying the main interface.](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-3.webp)

On the top left is a network switch. Ensure you have selected your parachain and that it is registered before purchasing a core.

To purchase a core, go to the menu on the left and select the **Purchase A Core** item under **Primary Market**. Here, you should see the cores available for purchase, details regarding the sale period, and its current phase. Alternatively, you may use this link to visit it: [**Primary Market > Purchase A Core**](https://app.regionx.tech/purchase){target=\_blank}.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-4.webp)

At the bottom-right corner of the page, select the **Purchase a Core** button. A modal detailing the fees will appear. Review the details, then click **Ok** and sign the transaction using the wallet of your choice.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-5.webp)

Once the transaction is confirmed, click [**My Regions**](https://app.regionx.tech/regions){target=\_blank} on the left-hand menu, and you will see your purchased core.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-6.webp)

Congratulations, you just purchased a core using RegionX! You can assign the core to your parachain, partition, interlace, and more using RegionX.

### Assign a Core

Once you have the core as shown in the dashboard, select it by clicking on it, then click the **Assign** option on the left-hand side. You will be presented with a modal in which you can add a new task.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-7.webp)

Click the **Add Task** button and input the parachain identifier, along with the name of your project, and finalize it by clicking **Add Task**.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-8.webp)

You may now select a task from the list. You must also set the core's finality, which determines whether you can renew this specific core. Provisional finality allows for interlacing and partitioning, whereas Final finality does not allow the region to be modified. A core must not be interlaced or partitioned to be renewable, so Finality should be selected if you want to renew this specific core.

Once you sign and send this transaction, that task/parachain will be assigned to that core.

## Order On Demand Coretime

On Polkadot.js Apps, make sure you're connected to the relay chain, then navigate to [**Developer > Extrinsics**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} and issue the `onDemand.placeOrderAllowDeath` extrinsic from the account that registered the `ParaID` by specifying sufficient `maxAmount` for the transaction to go through successfully.

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-9.webp)

There are two extrinsics which allow you to place orders for on-demand coretime:

- [**`onDemand.placeOrderAllowDeath`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/on_demand/pallet/dispatchables/fn.place_order_allow_death.html){target=\_blank} - will [reap](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-accounts#existential-deposit-and-reaping){target=\_blank} the account once the provided funds run out
- [**`onDemand.placeOrderKeepAlive`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/on_demand/pallet/dispatchables/fn.place_order_keep_alive.html){target=\_blank} - includes a check which will **not** reap the account if the provided funds will run out, ensuring the account is kept alive

With each successful on-demand extrinsic, the parachain head changes (you may have to zoom out on the browser for parachain head details to show up on the Polkadot.js Apps interface).

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/obtain-coretime/obtain-coretime-10.webp)

The same should also be reflected in the collator's logs, where you should see output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>polkadot-omni-node</span>

title: Pallet Benchmarking
description: Learn how to benchmark Polkadot SDK-based pallets, assigning precise weights to extrinsics for accurate fee calculation and runtime optimization.
---

## Introduction

After validating your pallet through testing and integrating it into your runtime, the next crucial step is benchmarking. Testing procedures were detailed in the [Pallet Unit Testing](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/pallet-unit-testing/){target=\_blank} tutorial, while runtime integration was covered in the [Add Pallets to the Runtime](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/){target=\_blank} guide.

Benchmarking assigns precise [weight](/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#weight){target=\_blank} to each extrinsic, 
measuring their computational and storage costs. These derived weights enable accurate fee calculation and resource 
allocation within the runtime.

This tutorial demonstrates how to:

- Configure your development environment for benchmarking
- Create and implement benchmark tests for your extrinsics
- Apply benchmark results to your pallet's extrinsics

For comprehensive information about benchmarking concepts, refer to the [Benchmarking](/develop/parachains/testing/benchmarking/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Environment Setup

Follow these steps to prepare your environment for pallet benchmarking:

1. Install the [`frame-omni-bencher`](https://crates.io/crates/frame-omni-bencher){target=\_blank} command-line tool:
    
    ```bash
    cargo install frame-omni-bencher
    ```

2. Update your pallet's `Cargo.toml` file in the `pallets/custom-pallet` directory with the following modifications:
    1. Add the [`frame-benchmarking`](https://docs.rs/frame-benchmarking/latest/frame_benchmarking/){target=\_blank} dependency:
    
        ```toml hl_lines="3" title="Cargo.toml"
        
        ...
        
        ```

    2. Enable benchmarking in the `std` features:
        ```toml hl_lines="6" title="Cargo.toml"
        "codec/std",
  "frame-support/std",
  "frame-system/std",
  "scale-info/std",
  "frame-benchmarking?/std",
]
        ```

    3. Add the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag:
        ```toml hl_lines="3-8" title="Cargo.toml"
        
        ...
        "frame-benchmarking/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-support/runtime-benchmarks",
  "frame-system/runtime-benchmarks",
  "sp-runtime/runtime-benchmarks",
]
        ```

3. Add your pallet to the runtime's benchmark configuration:
    1.  Register your pallet in `runtime/src/benchmarks.rs`:
        ```rust hl_lines="11" title="benchmarks.rs"
        [frame_system, SystemBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_balances, Balances]
    [pallet_session, SessionBench::<Runtime>]
    [pallet_timestamp, Timestamp]
    [pallet_message_queue, MessageQueue]
    [pallet_sudo, Sudo]
    [pallet_collator_selection, CollatorSelection]
    [cumulus_pallet_parachain_system, ParachainSystem]
    [cumulus_pallet_xcmp_queue, XcmpQueue]
    [custom_pallet, CustomPallet]
);
        ```

    2. Enable runtime benchmarking for your pallet in `runtime/Cargo.toml`:
        ```toml hl_lines="3" title="Cargo.toml"
        
          ...
        ]
        ```

4. Set up the benchmarking module in your pallet:
    1. Create a new `benchmarking.rs` file in your pallet directory:
        ```bash
        touch benchmarking.rs
        ```

    2. Add the benchmarking module to your pallet. In the pallet `lib.rs` file add the following:
        ```rust hl_lines="9-10" title="lib.rs"
        pub use pallet::*;

#[cfg(test)]
mod mock;

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;

#[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
mod benchmarking;
        ```

    The `benchmarking` module is gated behind the `runtime-benchmarks` feature flag. It will only be compiled when this flag is explicitly enabled in your project's `Cargo.toml` or via the `--features runtime-benchmarks` compilation flag.

## Implement Benchmark Tests

When writing benchmarking tests for your pallet, you'll create specialized test functions for each extrinsic, similar to unit tests. These tests use the mock runtime you created earlier for testing, allowing you to leverage its utility functions.

Every benchmark test must follow a three-step pattern:

1. **Setup** - perform any necessary setup before calling the extrinsic. This might include creating accounts, setting initial states, or preparing test data
2. **Execute the extrinsic** - execute the actual extrinsic using the [`#[extrinsic_call]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/v2/attr.extrinsic_call.html){target=\_blank} macro. This must be a single line that calls your extrinsic function with the origin as its first argument
3. **Verification** - check that the extrinsic worked correctly within the benchmark context by checking the expected state changes

Check the following example on how to benchmark the `increment` extrinsic:

```rust
fn increment() {
        let caller: T::AccountId = whitelisted_caller();

        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::<T>::set_counter_value(
            RawOrigin::Root.into(),
            5u32
        ));

        #[extrinsic_call]
        increment(RawOrigin::Signed(caller.clone()), 1);

        assert_eq!(CounterValue::<T>::get(), Some(6u32.into()));
        assert_eq!(UserInteractions::<T>::get(caller), 1u32.into());
    }
```

This benchmark test:

1. Creates a whitelisted caller and sets an initial counter value of 5
2. Calls the increment extrinsic to increase the counter by 1
3. Verifies that the counter was properly incremented to 6 and that the user's interaction was recorded in storage

This example demonstrates how to properly set up state, execute an extrinsic, and verify its effects during benchmarking.

Now, implement the complete set of benchmark tests. Copy the following content in the `benchmarking.rs` file:

use super::{Pallet as CustomPallet, *};
use frame_benchmarking::v2::*;
use frame_support::assert_ok;

#[benchmarks]
mod benchmarks {
    use super::*;
    #[cfg(test)]
    use crate::pallet::Pallet as CustomPallet;
    use frame_system::RawOrigin;

    #[benchmark]
    fn set_counter_value() {
        #[extrinsic_call]
        set_counter_value(RawOrigin::Root, 5);

        assert_eq!(CounterValue::<T>::get(), Some(5u32.into()));
    }

    #[benchmark]
    fn increment() {
        let caller: T::AccountId = whitelisted_caller();

        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::<T>::set_counter_value(
            RawOrigin::Root.into(),
            5u32
        ));

        #[extrinsic_call]
        increment(RawOrigin::Signed(caller.clone()), 1);

        assert_eq!(CounterValue::<T>::get(), Some(6u32.into()));
        assert_eq!(UserInteractions::<T>::get(caller), 1u32.into());
    }

    #[benchmark]
    fn decrement() {
        let caller: T::AccountId = whitelisted_caller();

        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::<T>::set_counter_value(
            RawOrigin::Root.into(),
            5u32
        ));

        #[extrinsic_call]
        decrement(RawOrigin::Signed(caller.clone()), 1);

        assert_eq!(CounterValue::<T>::get(), Some(4u32.into()));
        assert_eq!(UserInteractions::<T>::get(caller), 1u32.into());
    }

    impl_benchmark_test_suite!(CustomPallet, crate::mock::new_test_ext(), crate::mock::Test);
}
```

The [`#[benchmark]`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/v2/attr.benchmark.html){target=\_blank} macro marks these functions as benchmark tests, while the `#[extrinsic_call]` macro specifically identifies which line contains the extrinsic being measured. For more information, see the [frame_benchmarking](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_benchmarking/v2/index.html){target=\_blank} Rust docs.

## Execute the Benchmarking

After implementing your benchmark test suite, you'll need to execute the tests and generate the weights for your extrinsics. This process involves building your runtime with benchmarking features enabled and using the `frame-omni-bencher` CLI tool. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Build your runtime with the `runtime-benchmarks` feature enabled:

    ```bash
    cargo build --features runtime-benchmarks --release
    ```

    This special build includes all the necessary benchmarking code that's normally excluded from production builds.

2. Create a `weights.rs` file in your pallet's `src/` directory. This file will store the auto-generated weight calculations:

    ```bash
    touch weights.rs
    ```

3. Before running the benchmarking tool, you'll need a template file that defines how weight information should be formatted. Download the official template from the Polkadot SDK repository and save it in your project folders for future use:

    ```bash
    mkdir ./pallets/benchmarking && \
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/refs/tags/polkadot-stable2412/substrate/.maintain/frame-weight-template.hbs \
    --output ./pallets/benchmarking/frame-weight-template.hbs
    ```

4. Execute the benchmarking process using the `frame-omni-bencher` CLI:

    ```bash
    frame-omni-bencher v1 benchmark pallet \
    --runtime target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
    --pallet "custom_pallet" \
    --extrinsic "" \
    --template ./pallets/benchmarking/frame-weight-template.hbs \
    --output ./pallets/custom-pallet/src/weights.rs
    ```

When the benchmarking process completes, your `weights.rs` file will contain auto-generated code with weight calculations for each of your pallet's extrinsics. These weights help ensure fair and accurate fee calculations when your pallet is used in a production environment.

## Add Benchmarking Weights to the Pallet

After generating the weight calculations, you need to integrate these weights into your pallet's code. This integration ensures your pallet properly accounts for computational costs in its extrinsics.

First, add the necessary module imports to your pallet. These imports make the weights available to your code:

```rust hl_lines="4-5" title="lib.rs"
mod benchmarking;

pub mod weights;
use crate::weights::WeightInfo;
```

Next, update your pallet's `Config` trait to include weight information. Define the `WeightInfo` type:

```rust hl_lines="11-12" title="lib.rs"
#[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        // Defines the event type for the pallet.
        type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

        // Defines the maximum value the counter can hold.
        #[pallet::constant]
        type CounterMaxValue: Get<u32>;

        /// A type representing the weights required by the dispatchables of this pallet.
        type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
    }
```

Now you can assign weights to your extrinsics. Here's how to add weight calculations to the `set_counter_value` function:

```rust hl_lines="2" title="lib.rs"
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::set_counter_value())]
        pub fn set_counter_value(origin: OriginFor<T>, new_value: u32) -> DispatchResult {
            ensure_root(origin)?;

            ensure!(
                new_value <= T::CounterMaxValue::get(),
                Error::<T>::CounterValueExceedsMax
            );

            CounterValue::<T>::put(new_value);

            Self::deposit_event(Event::<T>::CounterValueSet {
                counter_value: new_value,
            });

            Ok(())
        }
```

You must apply similar weight annotations to the other extrinsics in your pallet. Add the `#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::function_name())]` attribute to both `increment` and `decrement`, replacing `function_name` with the respective function names from your `WeightInfo` trait.

For testing purposes, you must implement the weight calculations in your mock runtime. Open `custom-pallet/src/mock.rs` and add:

```rust hl_lines="4" title="mock.rs"
type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type CounterMaxValue = CounterMaxValue;
    type WeightInfo = custom_pallet::weights::SubstrateWeight<Test>;
}
```

Finally, configure the actual weight values in your production runtime. In `runtime/src/config/mod.rs`, add:

```rust hl_lines="5" title="mod.rs"
impl custom_pallet::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type CounterMaxValue = CounterMaxValue;
    type WeightInfo = custom_pallet::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
}
```

Your pallet is now complete with full testing and benchmarking support, ready for production use.

# Pallet Unit Testing

## Introduction

You have learned how to create a new pallet in the [Build a Custom Pallet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/build-custom-pallet/){target=\_blank} tutorial; now you will see how to test the pallet to ensure that it works as expected. As stated in the [Pallet Testing](/develop/parachains/testing/pallet-testing/){target=\_blank} article, unit testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of pallets in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. Comprehensive testing helps validate pallet functionality, prevent potential bugs, and maintain the integrity of your blockchain logic.

This tutorial will guide you through creating a unit testing suite for a custom pallet created in the [Build a Custom Pallet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/build-custom-pallet/){target=\_blank} tutorial, covering essential testing aspects and steps.

## Prerequisites

To set up your testing environment for Polkadot SDK pallets, you'll need:

- [Polkadot SDK dependencies](/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank} installed
- Basic understanding of Substrate/Polkadot SDK concepts
- A custom pallet implementation, check the [Build a Custom Pallet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/build-custom-pallet/){target=\_blank} tutorial
- Familiarity with [Rust testing frameworks](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html){target=\_blank}

## Set Up the Testing Environment

To effectively create the test environment for your pallet, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Move to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd custom-pallet
    ```

2. Add the required dependencies to your test configuration in the `Cargo.toml` file of the pallet:

    ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
    
    ...

    sp-core = { workspace = true, default-features = true }
sp-io = { workspace = true, default-features = true }
sp-runtime = { workspace = true, default-features = true }

[features]
    ...
    ```

3. Create a `mock.rs` and a `tests.rs` files (leave these files empty for now, they will be filled in later):

    ```bash
    touch src/mock.rs
    touch src/tests.rs
    ```

4. Include them in your `lib.rs` module:

    ```rust hl_lines="5-9" title="lib.rs"
    pub use pallet::*;

#[cfg(test)]
mod mock;

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;
    ```

## Implement Mocked Runtime

The following portion of code sets up a mock runtime (`Test`) to test the `custom-pallet` in an isolated environment. Using [`frame_support`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/index.html){target=\_blank} macros, it defines a minimal runtime configuration with traits such as `RuntimeCall` and `RuntimeEvent` to simulate runtime behavior. The mock runtime integrates the [`System pallet`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/index.html){target=\_blank}, which provides core functionality, and the `custom pallet` under specific indices. Copy and paste the following snippet of code into your `mock.rs` file:

```rust title="mock.rs"
use frame_support::{derive_impl, parameter_types};
use sp_runtime::BuildStorage;

type Block = frame_system::mocking::MockBlock<Test>;

#[frame_support::runtime]
mod runtime {
    #[runtime::runtime]
    #[runtime::derive(
        RuntimeCall,
        RuntimeEvent,
        RuntimeError,
        RuntimeOrigin,
        RuntimeFreezeReason,
        RuntimeHoldReason,
        RuntimeSlashReason,
        RuntimeLockId,
        RuntimeTask
    )]
    pub struct Test;

    #[runtime::pallet_index(0)]
    pub type System = frame_system::Pallet<Test>;

    #[runtime::pallet_index(1)]
    pub type CustomPallet = custom_pallet::Pallet<Test>;
}
```

Once you have your mock runtime set up, you can customize it by implementing the configuration traits for the `System pallet` and your `custom-pallet`, along with additional constants and initial states for testing. Here's an example of how to extend the runtime configuration. Copy and paste the following snippet of code below the previous one you added to `mock.rs`:

```rust title="mock.rs"
#[derive_impl(frame_system::config_preludes::TestDefaultConfig)]
impl frame_system::Config for Test {
    type Block = Block;
}

// Custom pallet configuration
parameter_types! {
    pub const CounterMaxValue: u32 = 10;
}

impl custom_pallet::Config for Test {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type CounterMaxValue = CounterMaxValue;

    type CounterMaxValue = CounterMaxValue;
    type WeightInfo = custom_pallet::weights::SubstrateWeight<Test>;
}

// Test externalities initialization
pub fn new_test_ext() -> sp_io::TestExternalities {
    frame_system::GenesisConfig::<Test>::default()
        .build_storage()
        .unwrap()
        .into()
}
```

Explanation of the additions:

- **System pallet configuration** - implements the `frame_system::Config` trait for the mock runtime, setting up the basic system functionality and specifying the block type
- **Custom pallet configuration** - defines the `Config` trait for the `custom-pallet`, including a constant (`CounterMaxValue`) to set the maximum allowed counter value. In this case, that value is set to 10 for testing purposes
- **Test externalities initialization** - the `new_test_ext()` function initializes the mock runtime with default configurations, creating a controlled environment for testing

## Implement Test Cases

Unit testing a pallet involves creating a comprehensive test suite that validates various scenarios. You ensure your pallet’s reliability, security, and expected behavior under different conditions by systematically testing successful operations, error handling, event emissions, state modifications, and access control.

Expand the following item to see the pallet calls to be tested.

???-code "Custom pallet calls"

    ```rust
    impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
        /// Set the value of the counter.
        ///
        /// The dispatch origin of this call must be _Root_.
        ///
        /// - `new_value`: The new value to set for the counter.
        ///
        /// Emits `CounterValueSet` event when successful.
        #[pallet::call_index(0)]
        #[pallet::weight(0)]
        ensure_root(origin)?;

                Error::<T>::CounterValueExceedsMax
            );

                    .unwrap_or(0)
                    .checked_add(1)
                    .ok_or(Error::<T>::UserInteractionOverflow)?;

            });

            Ok(())
        }
    }
    ```

The following sub-sections outline various scenarios in which the `custom-pallet` can be tested. Feel free to add these snippets to your `tests.rs` while you read the examples.

### Successful Operations

Verify that the counter can be successfully incremented under normal conditions, ensuring the increment works and the correct event is emitted.

```rust title="tests.rs"
#[test]
fn it_works_for_increment() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        System::set_block_number(1);
        // Initialize the counter value to 0
        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::set_counter_value(RuntimeOrigin::root(), 0));

        // Increment the counter by 5
        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::increment(RuntimeOrigin::signed(1), 5));
        // Check that the event emitted matches the increment operation
        System::assert_last_event(
            Event::CounterIncremented {
                counter_value: 5,
                who: 1,
                incremented_amount: 5,
            }
            .into(),
        );
    });
}
```

### Preventing Value Overflow

Test that the pallet prevents incrementing beyond the maximum allowed value, protecting against unintended state changes.

```rust title="tests.rs"
#[test]
fn increment_fails_for_max_value_exceeded() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        System::set_block_number(1);
        // Set counter value close to max (10)
        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::set_counter_value(RuntimeOrigin::root(), 7));
        // Ensure that incrementing by 4 exceeds max value (10) and fails
        assert_noop!(
            CustomPallet::increment(RuntimeOrigin::signed(1), 4),
            Error::<Test>::CounterValueExceedsMax // Expecting CounterValueExceedsMax error
        );
    });
}
```

### Origin and Access Control

Confirm that sensitive operations like setting counter value are restricted to authorized origins, preventing unauthorized modifications.

```rust title="tests.rs"
#[test]
fn set_counter_value_fails_for_non_root() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        System::set_block_number(1);
        // Ensure only root (privileged account) can set counter value
        assert_noop!(
            CustomPallet::set_counter_value(RuntimeOrigin::signed(1), 5), // non-root account
            sp_runtime::traits::BadOrigin // Expecting a BadOrigin error
        );
    });
}
```

### Edge Case Handling

Ensure the pallet gracefully handles edge cases, such as preventing increment operations that would cause overflow.

```rust title="tests.rs"
#[test]
fn increment_handles_overflow() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        System::set_block_number(1);
        // Set to max value
        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::set_counter_value(RuntimeOrigin::root(), 1));
        assert_noop!(
            CustomPallet::increment(RuntimeOrigin::signed(1), u32::MAX),
            Error::<Test>::CounterOverflow
        );
    });
}
```

### Verify State Changes

Test that pallet operations modify the internal state correctly and maintain expected storage values across different interactions.

```rust title="tests.rs"
#[test]
fn user_interactions_increment() {
    new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
        System::set_block_number(1);
        // Initialize counter value to 0
        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::set_counter_value(RuntimeOrigin::root(), 0));

        // Increment by 5 and decrement by 2
        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::increment(RuntimeOrigin::signed(1), 5));
        assert_ok!(CustomPallet::decrement(RuntimeOrigin::signed(1), 2));

        // Check if the user interactions are correctly tracked
        assert_eq!(UserInteractions::<Test>::get(1).unwrap_or(0), 2); // User should have 2 interactions
    });
}
```

        );
    });
}
    ```

## Run the Tests

Execute the test suite for your custom pallet using Cargo's test command. This will run all defined test cases and provide detailed output about the test results.

```bash
cargo test --package custom-pallet
```

After running the test suite, you should see the following output in your terminal:

description: Learn to compile and run a local parachain node using Polkadot SDK. Launch, run, and interact with a pre-configured runtime template.
---

# Set Up a Template

## Introduction

[Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank} offers a versatile and extensible blockchain development framework, enabling you to create custom blockchains tailored to your specific application or business requirements. 

This tutorial guides you through compiling and running a parachain node using the [Polkadot SDK Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/parachain){target=\_blank}.

The parachain template provides a pre-configured, functional runtime you can use in your local development environment. It includes several key components, such as user accounts and account balances.

These predefined elements allow you to experiment with common blockchain operations without requiring initial template modifications.
In this tutorial, you will:

- Build and start a local parachain node using the node template
- Explore how to use a front-end interface to:
    - View information about blockchain activity
    - Submit a transaction

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working local parachain and understand how to interact with it, setting the foundation for further customization and development.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have done the following:

- Completed the [Install Polkadot SDK Dependencies](/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank} guide and successfully installed [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} and the required packages to set up your development environment

## Utility Tools

This tutorial requires two essential tools:

- [**Chain spec builder**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_chain_spec_builder/index.html){target=\_blank} - is a Polkadot SDK utility for generating chain specifications
    
    Install it by executing the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo install staging-chain-spec-builder@9.0.0
    ```

    This installs the `chain-spec-builder` binary. Refer to the [Generate Chain Specs](/develop/parachains/deployment/generate-chain-specs/){target=\_blank} documentation for detailed usage.

- [**Polkadot Omni Node**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/omni_node/index.html){target=\_blank} - is a white-labeled binary, released as a part of Polkadot SDK that can act as the collator of a parachain in production, with all the related auxillary functionalities that a normal collator node has: RPC server, archiving state, etc. Moreover, it can also run the wasm blob of the parachain locally for testing and development.

    
    To install it, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo install polkadot-omni-node@0.4.0
    ```

    This installs the `polkadot-omni-node` binary.

## Compile the Runtime

The [Polkadot SDK Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/parachain){target=\_blank} provides a ready-to-use development environment for building using the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk){target=\_blank}. Follow these steps to compile the runtime:

1. Clone the template repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template.git parachain-template
    ```

2. Navigate to the root of the template directory:
    ```bash
    cd parachain-template
    ```

3. Compile the runtime:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

    !!!tip
        Initial compilation may take several minutes, depending on your machine specifications. Always use the `--release` flag to build optimized, production-ready artifacts.

4. Upon successful compilation, you should see output similar to:
    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>cargo build --release</span>
  <span data-ty>...</span>
  <span data-ty>Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 1.79s</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

## Start the Local Chain

After successfully compiling your runtime, you can spin up a local chain and produce blocks. This process will start your local parachain and allow you to interact. Follow these steps to launch your node in development mode:

1. First, you need to generate the chain spec file of your parachain:
    ```bash
    chain-spec-builder create -t development \
    --relay-chain paseo \
    --para-id 1000 \
    --runtime ./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
    named-preset development
    ```

2. Start the omni node with the generated chain spec. You'll start it in development mode (without a relay chain config), producing and finalizing blocks:

    ```bash
    polkadot-omni-node --chain ./chain_spec.json --dev
    ```

    The `--dev` option does the following:
    - Deletes all active data (keys, blockchain database, networking information) when stopped
    - Ensures a clean working state each time you restart the node

3. Verify that your node is running by reviewing the terminal output. You should see something similar to:
    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>polkadot-omni-node --chain ./chain_spec.json --dev</span>

The details of the log output will be explored in a later tutorial. For now, knowing that your node is running and producing blocks is sufficient.

## Interact with the Node

When running the template node, it's accessible by default at `ws://localhost:9944`. To interact with your node using the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} interface, follow these steps:

1. Open [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} in your web browser and click the network icon (which should be the Polkadot logo) in the top left corner as shown in the image below:
    
    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/set-up-a-template/set-up-a-template-1.webp)

2. Connect to your local node:
    1. Scroll to the bottom and select **Development**
    2. Choose **Custom**
    3. Enter `ws://localhost:9944` in the input field
    4. Click the **Switch** button
    
    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/set-up-a-template/set-up-a-template-2.webp)

3. Verify connection:
    - Once connected, you should see **parachain-template-runtime** in the top left corner
    - The interface will display information about your local blockchain
    
    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/set-up-a-template/set-up-a-template-3.webp)

You are now connected to your local node and can now interact with it through the Polkadot.js Apps interface. This tool enables you to explore blocks, execute transactions, and interact with your blockchain's features. For in-depth guidance on using the interface effectively, refer to the [Polkadot.js Guides](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-js-guides){target=\_blank} available on the Polkadot Wiki.

## Stop the Node

When you're done exploring your local node, you can stop it to remove any state changes you've made. Since you started the node with the `--dev` option, stopping the node will purge all persistent block data, allowing you to start fresh the next time.

To stop the local node:

1. Return to the terminal window where the node output is displayed
2. Press `Control-C` to stop the running process
3. Verify that your terminal returns to the prompt in the `parachain-template` directory

# Convert Assets on Asset Hub

## Introduction

Asset Conversion is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) utilizing [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core){target=\_blank} logic and implemented as a pallet on Polkadot's Asset Hub. For more details about this feature, please visit the [Asset Conversion on Asset Hub](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-asset-conversion-assethub){target=\_blank} wiki page.

This guide will provide detailed information about the key functionalities offered by the [Asset Conversion](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/{{dependencies.polkadot_sdk.stable_version}}/substrate/frame/asset-conversion){target=\_blank} pallet on Asset Hub, including:

- Creating a liquidity pool
- Adding liquidity to a pool
- Swapping assets
- Withdrawing liquidity from a pool

## Prerequisites

Before converting assets on Asset Hub, you must ensure you have:

- Access to the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps){target=\_blank} interface and a connection with the intended blockchain
- A funded wallet containing the assets you wish to convert and enough available funds to cover the transaction fees
- An asset registered on Asset Hub that you want to convert. If you haven't created an asset on Asset Hub yet, refer to the [Register a Local Asset](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-asset/){target=\_blank} or [Register a Foreign Asset](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-asset/){target=\_blank} documentation to create an asset.

## Create a Liquidity Pool

If an asset on Asset Hub does not have an existing liquidity pool, the first step is to create one.

The asset conversion pallet provides the `createPool` extrinsic to create a new liquidity pool, creating an empty liquidity pool and a new `LP token` asset.

!!! tip
    A testing token with the asset ID `1112` and the name `PPM` was created for this example.

As stated in the [Test Environment Setup](#test-environment-setup) section, this tutorial is based on the assumption that you have an instance of Polkadot Asset Hub running locally. Therefore, the demo liquidity pool will be created between DOT and PPM tokens. However, the same steps can be applied to any other asset on Asset Hub.

From the Asset Hub perspective, the Multilocation that identifies the PPM token is the following:

```javascript
{
  parents: 0,
  interior: {
    X2: [{ PalletInstance: 50 }, { GeneralIndex: 1112 }]
  }
}
```

The `PalletInstance` value of `50` represents the Assets pallet on Asset Hub. The `GeneralIndex` value of `1112` is the PPM asset's asset ID.

To create the liquidity pool, you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface
    1. Select **Developer** from the top menu
    2. Click on **Extrinsics** from the dropdown menu

    ![Extrinsics Section](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-1.webp)

2. Choose the **`AssetConversion`** pallet and click on the **`createPool`** extrinsic
    1. Select the **`AssetConversion`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`createPool`** extrinsic from the list of available extrinsics

    ![Create Pool Extrinsic](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-2.webp)

3. Fill in the required fields:
    1. **`asset1`** - the Multilocation of the first asset in the pool. In this case, it is the DOT token, which the following Multilocation represents:

        ```javascript
        {
          parents: 0,
          interior: 'Here'
        }
        ```

    2. **`asset2`** - the second asset's Multilocation within the pool. This refers to the PPM token, which the following Multilocation identifies:  

        ```javascript
        {
          parents: 0,
          interior: {
            X2: [{ PalletInstance: 50 }, { GeneralIndex: 1112 }]
          }
        }
        ```

    3. Click on **Submit Transaction** to create the liquidity pool

    ![Create Pool Fields](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-3.webp)

Signing and submitting the transaction triggers the creation of the liquidity pool. To verify the new pool's creation, check the **Explorer** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface and ensure that the **`PoolCreated`** event was emitted.

![Pool Created Event](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-4.webp)

As the preceding image shows, the **`lpToken`** ID created for this pool is 19. This ID is essential to identify the liquidity pool and associated LP tokens.

## Add Liquidity to a Pool

The `addLiquidity` extrinsic allows users to provide liquidity to a pool of two assets. Users specify their preferred amounts for both assets and minimum acceptable quantities. The function determines the best asset contribution, which may vary from the amounts desired but won't fall below the specified minimums. Providers receive liquidity tokens representing their pool portion in return for their contribution.

To add liquidity to a pool, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface
    1. Select **Developer** from the top menu
    2. Click on **Extrinsics** from the dropdown menu

    ![Extrinsics Section](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-1.webp)

2. Choose the **`assetConversion`** pallet and click on the **`addLiquidity`** extrinsic
    1. Select the **`assetConversion`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`addLiquidity`** extrinsic from the list of available extrinsics

    ![Add Liquidity Extrinsic](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-5.webp)

3. Fill in the required fields:
    1. **`asset1`** - the Multilocation of the first asset in the pool. In this case, it is the DOT token, which the following Multilocation represents:

        ```javascript
        {
          parents: 0,
          interior: 'Here'
        }
        ```

    2. **`asset2`** - the second asset's Multilocation within the pool. This refers to the PPM token, which the following Multilocation identifies:

        ```javascript
        {
          parents: 0,
          interior: {
            X2: [{ PalletInstance: 50 }, { GeneralIndex: 1112 }]
          }
        }
        ```

    3. **`amount1Desired`** - the amount of the first asset that will be contributed to the pool
    4. **`amount2Desired`** - the quantity of the second asset intended for pool contribution
    5. **`amount1Min`** - the minimum amount of the first asset that will be contributed
    6. **`amount2Min`** - the lowest acceptable quantity of the second asset for contribution
    7. **`mintTo`** - the account to which the liquidity tokens will be minted
    8. Click on **Submit Transaction** to add liquidity to the pool

    ![Add Liquidity Fields](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-6.webp)

    !!! warning
        Ensure that the appropriate amount of tokens provided has been minted previously and is available in your account before adding liquidity to the pool.

    In this case, the liquidity provided to the pool is between DOT tokens and PPM tokens with the asset ID 1112 on Polkadot Asset Hub. The intention is to provide liquidity for 1 DOT token (`u128` value of 1000000000000 as it has 10 decimals) and 1 PPM token (`u128` value of 1000000000000 as it also has 10 decimals).

Signing and submitting the transaction adds liquidity to the pool. To verify the liquidity addition, check the **Explorer** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface and ensure that the **`LiquidityAdded`** event was emitted.

![Liquidity Added Event](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-7.webp)

## Swap Assets

### Swap from an Exact Amount of Tokens

The asset conversion pallet enables users to exchange a specific quantity of one asset for another in a designated liquidity pool by swapping them for an exact amount of tokens. It guarantees the user will receive at least a predetermined minimum amount of the second asset. This function increases trading predictability and allows users to conduct asset exchanges with confidence that they are assured a minimum return.

To swap assets for an exact amount of tokens, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface
    1. Select **Developer** from the top menu
    2. Click on **Extrinsics** from the dropdown menu

    ![Extrinsics Section](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-1.webp)

2. Choose the **`AssetConversion`** pallet and click on the **`swapExactTokensForTokens`** extrinsic
    1. Select the **`AssetConversion`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`swapExactTokensForTokens`** extrinsic from the list of available extrinsics

    ![Swap From Exact Tokens Extrinsic](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-8.webp)

3. Fill in the required fields:
    1. **`path:Vec<StagingXcmV3MultiLocation>`** - an array of Multilocations representing the path of the swap. The first and last elements of the array are the input and output assets, respectively. In this case, the path consists of two elements:

        - **`0: StagingXcmV3MultiLocation`** - the Multilocation of the first asset in the pool. In this case, it is the DOT token, which the following Multilocation represents:

            ```javascript
            {
              parents: 0,
              interior: 'Here'
            }
            ```

        - **`1: StagingXcmV3MultiLocation`** - the second asset's Multilocation within the pool. This refers to the PPM token, which the following Multilocation identifies:

            ```javascript
            {
              parents: 0,
              interior: {
                X2: [{ PalletInstance: 50 }, { GeneralIndex: 1112 }]
              }
            }
            ```

    2. **`amountOut`** - the exact amount of the second asset that the user wants to receive
    3. **`amountInMax`** - the maximum amount of the first asset that the user is willing to swap
    4. **`sendTo`** - the account to which the swapped assets will be sent
    5. **`keepAlive`** - a boolean value that determines whether the pool should be kept alive after the swap
    6. Click on **Submit Transaction** to swap assets for an exact amount of tokens

    ![Swap For Exact Tokens Fields](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-9.webp)

    !!! warning
        Ensure that the appropriate amount of tokens provided has been minted previously and is available in your account before adding liquidity to the pool.

    In this case, the intention is to swap 0.01 DOT token (u128 value of 100000000000 as it has 10 decimals) for 0.04 PPM token (u128 value of 400000000000 as it also has 10 decimals).

Signing and submitting the transaction will execute the swap. To verify execution, check the **Explorer** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface and make sure that the **`SwapExecuted`** event was emitted.

![Swap From Exact Tokens Event](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-10.webp)

### Swap to an Exact Amount of Tokens

Conversely, the Asset Conversion pallet comes with a function that allows users to trade a variable amount of one asset to acquire a precise quantity of another. It ensures that users stay within a set maximum of the initial asset to obtain the desired amount of the second asset. This provides a method to control transaction costs while achieving the intended result.

To swap assets for an exact amount of tokens, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface
    1. Select **Developer** from the top menu
    2. Click on **Extrinsics** from the dropdown menu

    ![Extrinsics Section](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-1.webp)

2. Choose the **`AssetConversion`** pallet and click on the **`swapTokensForExactTokens`** extrinsic:
    1. Select the **`AssetConversion`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`swapTokensForExactTokens`** extrinsic from the list of available extrinsics

    ![Swap Tokens For Exact Tokens Extrinsic](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-11.webp)

3. Fill in the required fields:
    1. **`path:Vec<StagingXcmV3MultiLocation\>`** - an array of Multilocations representing the path of the swap. The first and last elements of the array are the input and output assets, respectively. In this case, the path consists of two elements:
        - **`0: StagingXcmV3MultiLocation`** - the Multilocation of the first asset in the pool. In this case, it is the PPM token, which the following Multilocation represents:

            ```javascript
            {
              parents: 0,
              interior: {
                X2: [{ PalletInstance: 50 }, { GeneralIndex: 1112 }]
              }
            }
            ```

        - **`1: StagingXcmV3MultiLocation`** - the second asset's Multilocation within the pool. This refers to the DOT token, which the following Multilocation identifies:

            ```javascript
            {
              parents: 0,
              interior: 'Here'
            }
            ```

    2. **`amountOut`** - the exact amount of the second asset that the user wants to receive
    3. **`amountInMax`** - the maximum amount of the first asset that the user is willing to swap
    4. **`sendTo`** - the account to which the swapped assets will be sent
    5. **`keepAlive`** - a boolean value that determines whether the pool should be kept alive after the swap
    6. Click on **Submit Transaction** to swap assets for an exact amount of tokens

## Withdraw Liquidity from a Pool

The Asset Conversion pallet provides the `removeLiquidity` extrinsic to remove liquidity from a pool. This function allows users to withdraw the liquidity they offered from a pool, returning the original assets. When calling this function, users specify the number of liquidity tokens (representing their share in the pool) they wish to burn. They also set minimum acceptable amounts for the assets they expect to receive back. This mechanism ensures that users can control the minimum value they receive, protecting against unfavorable price movements during the withdrawal process.

To withdraw liquidity from a pool, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface
    1. Select **Developer** from the top menu
    2. Click on **Extrinsics** from the dropdown menu

    ![Extrinsics Section](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-1.webp)

2. Choose the **`AssetConversion`** pallet and click on the **`remove_liquidity`** extrinsic
    1. Select the **`AssetConversion`** pallet
    2. Choose the **`removeLiquidity`** extrinsic from the list of available extrinsics

    ![Remove Liquidity Extrinsic](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-14.webp)

3. Fill in the required fields:
    1. **`asset1`** - the Multilocation of the first asset in the pool. In this case, it is the DOT token, which the following Multilocation represents:

        ```javascript
        {
          parents: 0,
          interior: 'Here'
        }
        ```

    2. **`asset2`** - the second asset's Multilocation within the pool. This refers to the PPM token, which the following Multilocation identifies:

        ```javascript
        {
          parents: 0,
          interior: {
            X2: [{ PalletInstance: 50 }, { GeneralIndex: 1112 }]
          }
        }
        ```

    3. **`lpTokenBurn`** - the number of liquidity tokens to burn
    4. **`amount1MinReceived`** - the minimum amount of the first asset that the user expects to receive
    5. **`amount2MinReceived`** - the minimum quantity of the second asset the user expects to receive
    6. **`withdrawTo`** - the account to which the withdrawn assets will be sent
    7. Click on **Submit Transaction** to withdraw liquidity from the pool

    ![Remove Liquidity Fields](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-15.webp)

    !!! warning
        Ensure that the tokens provided have been minted previously and are available in your account before withdrawing liquidity from the pool.

    In this case, the intention is to withdraw 0.05 liquidity tokens from the pool, expecting to receive 0.004 DOT token (`u128` value of 40000000000 as it has 10 decimals) and 0.04 PPM token (`u128` value of 400000000000 as it also has 10 decimals).

Signing and submitting the transaction will initiate the withdrawal of liquidity from the pool. To verify the withdrawal, check the **Explorer** section on the Polkadot.js Apps interface and ensure that the **`LiquidityRemoved`** event was emitted.

![Remove Liquidity Event](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/asset-conversion-16.webp)

## Test Environment Setup

To test the Asset Conversion pallet, you can set up a local test environment to simulate different scenarios. This guide uses Chopsticks to spin up an instance of Polkadot Asset Hub. For further details on using Chopsticks, please refer to the [Chopsticks documentation](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started){target=\_blank}.

To set up a local test environment, execute the following command:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
--config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot-asset-hub.yml
```

This command initiates a lazy fork of Polkadot Asset Hub, including the most recent block information from the network. For Kusama Asset Hub testing, simply switch out `polkadot-asset-hub.yml` with `kusama-asset-hub.yml` in the command.

You now have a local Asset Hub instance up and running, ready for you to test various asset conversion procedures. The process here mirrors what you'd do on MainNet. After completing a transaction on TestNet, you can apply the same steps to convert assets on MainNet.

# Asset Hub Tutorials

## Benefits of Asset Hub

Polkadot SDK-based relay chains focus on security and consensus, leaving asset management to an external component, such as a [system chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/){target=\_blank}. The [Asset Hub](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub/){target=\_blank} is one example of a system chain and is vital to managing tokens which aren't native to the Polkadot ecosystem. Developers opting to integrate with Asset Hub can expect the following benefits:

- **Support for non-native on-chain assets** - create and manage your own tokens or NFTs with Polkadot ecosystem compatibility available out of the box
- **Lower transaction fees** - approximately 1/10th of the cost of using the relay chain
- **Reduced deposit requirements** - approximately 1/100th of the deposit required for the relay chain
- **Payment of fees with non-native assets** - no need to buy native tokens for gas, increasing flexibility for developers and users

## Get Started

Through these tutorials, you'll learn how to manage cross-chain assets, including:

- Asset registration and configuration
- Cross-chain asset representation
- Liquidity pool creation and management 
- Asset swapping and conversion
- Transaction parameter optimization

# Register a Foreign Asset on Asset Hub

## Introduction

As outlined in the [Asset Hub Overview](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub){target=\_blank}, Asset Hub supports two categories of assets: local and foreign. Local assets are created on the Asset Hub system parachain and are identified by integer IDs. On the other hand, foreign assets, which originate outside of Asset Hub, are recognized by [Multilocations](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/xcm/fundamentals/multilocation-summary){target=\_blank}.

When registering a foreign asset on Asset Hub, it's essential to notice that the process involves communication between two parachains. The Asset Hub parachain will be the destination of the foreign asset, while the source parachain will be the origin of the asset. The communication between the two parachains is facilitated by the [Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm){target=\_blank} protocol.

This guide will take you through the process of registering a foreign asset on the Asset Hub parachain.

## Prerequisites

The Asset Hub parachain is one of the system parachains on a relay chain, such as [Polkadot](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer){target=\_blank} or [Kusama](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer){target=\_blank}. To interact with these parachains, you can use the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} interface for:

- [Polkadot Asset Hub](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fasset-hub-polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/explorer){target=\_blank}
- [Kusama Asset Hub](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fsys.ibp.network%2Fstatemine#/explorer){target=\_blank}

For testing purposes, you can also interact with the Asset Hub instance on the following test networks:

- [Paseo Asset Hub](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpas-rpc.stakeworld.io%2Fassethub#/explorer){target=\_blank}

Before you start, ensure that you have: 

- Access to the Polkadot.js Apps interface, and you are connected to the desired chain
- A parachain that supports the XCMP protocol to interact with the Asset Hub parachain
- A funded wallet to pay for the transaction fees and subsequent registration of the foreign asset

This guide will use Polkadot, its local Asset Hub instance, and the [Astar](https://astar.network/){target=\_blank} parachain (`ID` 2006), as stated in the [Test Environment Setup](#test-environment-setup) section. However, the process is the same for other relay chains and their respective Asset Hub parachain, regardless of the network you are using and the parachain owner of the foreign asset.

## Steps to Register a Foreign Asset

### Asset Hub

1. Open the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface and connect to the Asset Hub parachain using the network selector in the top left corner 

      - Testing foreign asset registration is recommended on TestNet before proceeding to MainNet. If you haven't set up a local testing environment yet, consult the [Environment setup](#test-environment-setup) guide. After setting up, connect to the Local Node (Chopsticks) at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000`
      - For live network operations, connect to the Asset Hub parachain. You can choose either Polkadot or Kusama Asset Hub from the dropdown menu, selecting your preferred RPC provider

2. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** page
      1. Click on the **Developer** tab from the top navigation bar
      2. Select **Extrinsics** from the dropdown

    ![Access to Developer Extrinsics section](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-assets/register-a-foreign-asset-1.webp)

3. Select the Foreign Assets pallet
      3. Select the **`foreignAssets`** pallet from the dropdown list
      4. Choose the **`create`** extrinsic

    ![Select the Foreign Asset pallet](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-assets/register-a-foreign-asset-2.webp)

3. Fill out the required fields and click on the copy icon to copy the **encoded call data** to your clipboard. The fields to be filled are:

    - **id** - as this is a foreign asset, the ID will be represented by a Multilocation that reflects its origin. For this case, the Multilocation of the asset will be from the source parachain perspective:
  
        ```javascript
        { parents: 1, interior: { X1: [{ Parachain: 2006 }] } }
        ```

    - **admin** - refers to the account that will be the admin of this asset. This account will be able to manage the asset, including updating its metadata. As the registered asset corresponds to a native asset of the source parachain, the admin account should be the sovereign account of the source parachain
      
        The sovereign account can be obtained through [Substrate Utilities](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/){target=\_blank}.

        Ensure that **Sibling** is selected and that the **Para ID** corresponds to the source parachain. In this case, since the guide follows the test setup stated in the [Test Environment Setup](#test-environment-setup) section, the **Para ID** is `2006`.

        ![Get parachain sovereign account](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-assets/register-a-foreign-asset-3.webp)


    - **`minBalance`** - the minimum balance required to hold this asset

    ![Fill out the required fields](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-assets/register-a-foreign-asset-4.webp)

    !!! tip 
        If you need an example of the encoded call data, you can copy the following:
        ```
        0x3500010100591f007369626cd6070000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0860100000000000000000000000000
        ```


### Source Parachain

1. Navigate to the **Developer > Extrinsics** section
2. Create the extrinsic to register the foreign asset through XCM
      1. Paste the **encoded call data** copied in the previous step
      2. Click the **Submit Transaction** button

    ![Register foreign asset through XCM](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-assets/register-a-foreign-asset-5.webp)

    This XCM call involves withdrawing DOT from the sibling account of the parachain, using it to initiate an execution. The transaction will be carried out with XCM as the origin kind, and will be a hex-encoded call to create a foreign asset on Asset Hub for the specified parachain asset multilocation. Any surplus will be refunded, and the asset will be deposited into the sibling account.

    !!! warning
        Note that the sovereign account on the Asset Hub parachain must have a sufficient balance to cover the XCM `BuyExecution` instruction. If the account does not have enough balance, the transaction will fail.

    If you want to have the whole XCM call ready to be copied, go to the **Developer > Extrinsics > Decode** section and paste the following hex-encoded call data:
    ```
    0x6300330003010100a10f030c000400010000070010a5d4e81300010000070010a5d4e80006030700b4f13501419ce03500010100591f007369626cd607000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    ```

    Be sure to replace the encoded call data with the one you copied in the previous step.

After the transaction is successfully executed, the foreign asset will be registered on the Asset Hub parachain. 

## Asset Registration Verification

To confirm that a foreign asset has been successfully accepted and registered on the Asset Hub parachain, you can navigate to the `Network > Explorer` section of the Polkadot.js Apps interface for Asset Hub. You should be able to see an event that includes the following details:

![Asset registration event](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-assets/register-a-foreign-asset-6.webp)

In the image above, the **success** field indicates whether the asset registration was successful.

## Test Environment Setup

To test the foreign asset registration process before deploying it on a live network, you can set up a local parachain environment. This guide uses Chopsticks to simulate that process. For more information on using Chopsticks, please refer to the [Chopsticks documentation](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started){target=\_blank}.

To set up a test environment, run the following command:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks xcm \
--r polkadot \
--p polkadot-asset-hub \
--p astar
```

The preceding command will create a lazy fork of Polkadot as the relay chain, its Asset Hub instance, and the Astar parachain. The `xcm` parameter enables communication through the XCMP protocol between the relay chain and the parachains, allowing the registration of foreign assets on Asset Hub. For further information on the chopsticks usage of the XCMP protocol, refer to the [XCM Testing](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/#xcm-testing){target=\_blank} section of the Chopsticks documentation.

After executing the command, the terminal will display output indicating the Polkadot relay chain, the Polkadot Asset Hub, and the Astar parachain are running locally and connected through XCM. You can access them individually via the Polkadot.js Apps interface.

# Register a Local Asset on Asset Hub

## Introduction

As detailed in the [Asset Hub Overview](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub){target=\_blank} page, Asset Hub accommodates two types of assets: local and foreign. Local assets are those that were created in Asset Hub and are identifiable by an integer ID. On the other hand, foreign assets originate from a sibling parachain and are identified by a Multilocation.

This guide will take you through the steps of registering a local asset on the Asset Hub parachain.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have access to the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface and a funded wallet with DOT or KSM.

- For Polkadot Asset Hub, you would need a deposit of 10 DOT and around 0.201 DOT for the metadata
- For Kusama Asset Hub, the deposit is 0.1 KSM and around 0.000669 KSM for the metadata

You need to ensure that your Asset Hub account balance is a bit more than the sum of those two deposits, which should seamlessly account for the required deposits and transaction fees.

## Steps to Register a Local Asset

To register a local asset on the Asset Hub parachain, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} interface and connect to the Asset Hub parachain using the network selector in the top left corner 

      - You may prefer to test local asset registration on TestNet before registering the asset on a MainNet hub. If you still need to set up a local testing environment, review the [Environment setup](#test-setup-environment) section for instructions. Once the local environment is set up, connect to the Local Node (Chopsticks) available on `ws://127.0.0.1:8000`
      - For the live network, connect to the **Asset Hub** parachain. Either Polkadot or Kusama Asset Hub can be selected from the dropdown list, choosing the desired RPC provider

2. Click on the **Network** tab on the top navigation bar and select **Assets** from the dropdown list

      ![Access to Asset Hub through Polkadot.JS](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-assets/register-a-local-asset-1.webp)

3. Now, you need to examine all the registered asset IDs. This step is crucial to ensure that the asset ID you are about to register is unique. Asset IDs are displayed in the **assets** column

      ![Asset IDs on Asset Hub](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-assets/register-a-local-asset-2.webp)

4. Once you have confirmed that the asset ID is unique, click on the **Create** button on the top right corner of the page

      ![Create a new asset](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-assets/register-a-local-asset-3.webp)

5. Fill in the required fields in the **Create Asset** form:

    1. **creator account** - the account to be used for creating this asset and setting up the initial metadata
    2. **asset name** - the descriptive name of the asset you are registering
    3. **asset symbol** - the symbol that will be used to represent the asset
    4. **asset decimals** - the number of decimal places for this token, with a maximum of 20 allowed through the user interface
    5. **minimum balance** - the minimum balance for the asset. This is specified in the units and decimals as requested
    6. **asset ID** - the selected id for the asset. This should not match an already-existing asset id
    7. Click on the **Next** button
 
    ![Create Asset Form](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-assets/register-a-local-asset-4.webp)

6. Choose the accounts for the roles listed below:

    1. **admin account** - the account designated for continuous administration of the token      
    2. **issuer account** - the account that will be used for issuing this token
    3. **freezer account** - the account that will be used for performing token freezing operations
    4. Click on the **Create** button

## Verify Asset Registration

After completing these steps, the asset will be successfully registered. You can now view your asset listed on the [**Assets**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fasset-hub-polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/assets){target=\_blank} section of the Polkadot.js Apps interface.

![Asset listed on Polkadot.js Apps](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-assets/register-a-local-asset-7.webp)

!!! tip
    Take into consideration that the **Assets** section’s link may differ depending on the network you are using. For the local environment, enter `ws://127.0.0.1:8000` into the **Custom Endpoint** field.

In this way, you have successfully registered a local asset on the Asset Hub parachain.

For an in-depth explanation about Asset Hub and its features, see the [Asset Hub](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-asset-conversion-assethub){target=\_blank} entry in the Polkadot Wiki.

## Test Setup Environment

You can set up a local parachain environment to test the asset registration process before deploying it on the live network. This guide uses Chopsticks to simulate that process. For further information on chopsticks usage, refer to the [Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started){target=\_blank} documentation.

To set up a test environment, execute the following command:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
--config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot-asset-hub.yml
```

The above command will spawn a lazy fork of Polkadot Asset Hub with the latest block data from the network. If you need to test Kusama Asset Hub, replace `polkadot-asset-hub.yml` with `kusama-asset-hub.yml` in the command.

An Asset Hub instance is now running locally, and you can proceed with the asset registration process. Note that the local registration process does not differ from the live network process. Once you have a successful TestNet transaction, you can use the same steps to register the asset on MainNet.

# System Chains Tutorials

In this section, you'll gain hands-on experience building solutions that integrate with [system chains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/){target=\_blank} on Polkadot using the Polkadot SDK. System chains like the [Asset Hub](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub/){target=\_blank} provide essential infrastructure for enabling cross-chain interoperability and asset management across the Polkadot ecosystem. 

Through these tutorials, you'll learn how to leverage these system chains to enhance the functionality and security of your blockchain applications.

## For Parachain Integrators

Enhance cross-chain interoperability and expand your parachain’s functionality:

- **[Register your parachain's asset on Asset Hub](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-asset/)** - connect your parachain’s assets to Asset Hub as a foreign asset using XCM, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers and integration

## For Developers Leveraging System Chains

Unlock new possibilities by tapping into Polkadot’s system chains:

- **[Register a new asset on Asset Hub](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-asset/)** - create and customize assets directly on Asset Hub (local assets) with parameters like metadata, minimum balances, and more

- **[Convert Assets](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/)** - use Asset Hub's AMM functionality to swap between different assets, provide liquidity to pools, and manage LP tokens

# Fork a Chain with Chopsticks

## Introduction

Chopsticks is an innovative tool that simplifies the process of forking live Polkadot SDK chains. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure and fork chains, enabling developers to:

- Replay blocks for state analysis
- Test cross-chain messaging (XCM)
- Simulate blockchain environments for debugging and experimentation

With support for both configuration files and CLI commands, Chopsticks offers flexibility for diverse development workflows. Whether you're testing locally or exploring complex blockchain scenarios, Chopsticks empowers developers to gain deeper insights and accelerate application development.

Chopsticks uses the [Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot){target=\_blank} light client, which does not support calls made through the Ethereum JSON-RPC. As a result, you can't fork your chain using Chopsticks and then interact with it using tools like MetaMask.

For additional support and information, please reach out through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/issues){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have completed the following:

- **Installed Chopsticks** - if you still need to do so, see the [Install Chopsticks](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/#install-chopsticks){target=\_blank} guide for assistance
- **Reviewed** [**Configure Chopsticks**](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/#configure-chopsticks){target=\_blank} - and understand how forked chains are configured

## Configuration File 

To run Chopsticks using a configuration file, utilize the `--config` flag. You can use a raw GitHub URL, a path to a local file, or simply the chain's name. The following commands all look different but they use the `polkadot` configuration in the same way:

=== "GitHub URL"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
    --config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

=== "Local File Path"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

=== "Chain Name"

    ```bash
    npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=polkadot
    ```

Regardless of which method you choose from the preceding examples, you'll see an output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx @acala-network/chopsticks --config=polkadot</span>
  <br />
  <span data-ty>[18:38:26.155] INFO: Loading config file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/master/configs/polkadot.yml</span>
  <span data-ty> app: "chopsticks"</span>
  <span data-ty> chopsticks::executor TRACE: Calling Metadata_metadata</span>
  <span data-ty> chopsticks::executor TRACE: Completed Metadata_metadata</span>
  <span data-ty>[18:38:28.186] INFO: Polkadot RPC listening on port 8000</span>
  <span data-ty> app: "chopsticks"</span>
</div>

If using a file path, make sure you've downloaded the [Polkadot configuration file](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/blob/master/configs/polkadot.yml){target=\_blank}, or have created your own.

## Create a Fork

Once you've configured Chopsticks, use the following command to fork Polkadot at block 100:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks \
--endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com \
--block 100
```

If the fork is successful, you will see output similar to the following:

-8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/polkadot-fork-01.html'

Access the running Chopsticks fork using the default address.

```bash
ws://localhost:8000
```

## Interact with a Fork

You can interact with the forked chain using various [libraries](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-tools-index#libraries){target=\_blank} such as [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/){target=\_blank} and its user interface, [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank}.

### Use Polkadot.js Apps

To interact with Chopsticks via the hosted user interface, visit [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer){target=\_blank} and follow these steps:

1. Select the network icon in the top left corner

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/chopsticks-1.webp)

2. Scroll to the bottom and select **Development**
3. Choose **Custom**
4. Enter `ws://localhost:8000` in the input field
5. Select the **Switch** button

    ![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/chopsticks-2.webp)

You should now be connected to your local fork and can interact with it as you would with a real chain.

### Use Polkadot.js Library

For programmatic interaction, you can use the Polkadot.js library. The following is a basic example:

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

async function connectToFork() {
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('ws://localhost:8000');
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });
  await api.isReady;

  // Now you can use 'api' to interact with your fork
  console.log(`Connected to chain: ${await api.rpc.system.chain()}`);
}

connectToFork();
```

## Replay Blocks

Chopsticks allows you to replay specific blocks from a chain, which is useful for debugging and analyzing state changes. You can use the parameters in the [Configuration](/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/#configure-chopsticks){target=\_blank} section to set up the chain configuration, and then use the run-block subcommand with the following additional options:

- `output-path` - path to print output
- `html` - generate HTML with storage diff
- `open` - open generated HTML

For example, the command to replay block 1000 from Polkadot and save the output to a JSON file would be as follows:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks run-block  \
--endpoint wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com  \
--output-path ./polkadot-output.json  \
--block 1000
```

??? code "polkadot-output.json"

    ```json

## XCM Testing

To test XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) messages between networks, you can fork multiple parachains and a relay chain locally using Chopsticks.

- `relaychain` - relay chain config file
- `parachain` - parachain config file  

For example, to fork Moonbeam, Astar, and Polkadot enabling XCM between them, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks xcm \
--r polkadot \
--p moonbeam \
--p astar
```

After running it, you should see output similar to the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx @acala-network/chopsticks xcm \</span>
  <span data-ty>--r polkadot \</span>
  <span data-ty>--p moonbeam \</span>
  <span data-ty>--p astar</span>

# Spawn a Basic Chain with Zombienet

## Introduction

Zombienet simplifies blockchain development by enabling developers to create temporary, customizable networks for testing and validation. These ephemeral chains are ideal for experimenting with configurations, debugging applications, and validating functionality in a controlled environment.

In this guide, you'll learn how to define a basic network configuration file, spawn a blockchain network using Zombienet's CLI, and interact with nodes and monitor network activity using tools like Polkadot.js Apps and Prometheus

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped to deploy and test your own blockchain networks, paving the way for more advanced setups and use cases.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you must ensure you've first:

- [Installed Zombienet](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/#install-zombienet){target=\_blank}. This tutorial requires Zombienet version `{{ dependencies.zombienet.version }}`. Verify that you're using the specified version to ensure compatibility with the instructions.
- Reviewed the information in [Configure Zombienet](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/#configure-zombienet){target=\_blank} and understand how to customize a spawned network

## Define the Network

Zombienet uses a [configuration file](/develop/toolkit/parachains/spawn-chains/zombienet/get-started/#configuration-files){target=\_blank} to define the ephemeral network that will be spawned. Follow these steps to create and define the configuration file:

1. Create a file named `spawn-a-basic-network.toml`
```bash
touch spawn-a-basic-network.toml
```
2. Add the following code to the file you just created:
```toml title="spawn-a-basic-network.toml"
[settings]
timeout = 120

[relaychain]

[[relaychain.nodes]]
name = "alice"
validator = true

[[relaychain.nodes]]
name = "bob"
validator = true

[[parachains]]
id = 100

[parachains.collator]
name = "collator01"
```

This configuration file defines a network with the following chains:

- **relaychain** - with two nodes named `alice` and `bob` 
- **parachain** - with a collator named `collator01` 

Settings also defines a timeout of 120 seconds for the network to be ready.

## Spawn the Network

To spawn the network, run the following command:

```bash
zombienet -p native spawn spawn-a-basic-network.toml
```

This command will spawn the network defined in the `spawn-a-basic-network.toml` configuration file. The `-p native` flag specifies that the network will be spawned using the native provider.

If successful, you will see the following output:

<div id="termynal" class="table-termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>zombienet -p native spawn spawn-a-basic-network.toml</span>

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

!!! note 
    If the IPs and ports aren't explicitly defined in the configuration file, they may change each time the network is started, causing the links provided in the output to differ from the example.

## Interact with the Spawned Network

After the network is launched, you can interact with it using [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank}. To do so, open your browser and use the provided links listed by the output as `Direct Link`.

### Connect to the Nodes

Use the [55308 port address](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:55308#explorer){target=\_blank} to interact with the same `alice` node used for this tutorial. Ports can change from spawn to spawn so be sure to locate the link in the output when spawning your own node to ensure you are accessing the correct port.

If you want to interact with the nodes more programmatically, you can also use the [Polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/){target=\_blank}. For example, the following code snippet shows how to connect to the `alice` node using the Polkadot.js API and log some information about the chain and node:

```typescript
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

async function main() {
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('ws://127.0.0.1:55308');
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });

  // Retrieve the chain & node information via rpc calls
  const [chain, nodeName, nodeVersion] = await Promise.all([
    api.rpc.system.chain(),
    api.rpc.system.name(),
    api.rpc.system.version(),
  ]);

  console.log(
    `You are connected to chain ${chain} using ${nodeName} v${nodeVersion}`,
  );
}

main()
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => process.exit());
```

Both methods allow you to interact easily with the network and its nodes.

### Check Metrics

You can also check the metrics of the nodes by accessing the links provided in the output as `Prometheus Link`. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=\_blank} is a monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from the nodes. By accessing the provided links, you can see the metrics of the nodes in a web interface. So, for example, the following image shows the Prometheus metrics for Bob's node from the Zombienet test:

![](/images/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/spawn-basic-chain/spawn-basic-network-01.webp)

### Check Logs

To view individual node logs, locate the `Log Cmd` command in Zombienet's startup output. For example, to see what the alice node is doing, find the log command that references `alice.log` in its file path. Note that Zombienet will show you the correct path for your instance when it starts up, so use that path rather than copying from the below example:

```bash
tail -f  /tmp/zombie-794af21178672e1ff32c612c3c7408dc_-2397036-6717MXDxcS55/alice.log
```

After running this command, you will see the logs of the `alice` node in real-time, which can be useful for debugging purposes. The logs of the `bob` and `collator01` nodes can be checked similarly.
