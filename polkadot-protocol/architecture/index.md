# Architecture

Explore Polkadot's architecture, including the relay chain, parachains, and system chains, and discover the role each component plays in the broader ecosystem.

## A Brief Look at Polkadotâ€™s Chain Ecosystem

The following provides a brief overview of the role of each chain:

- **Polkadot chain** - the central hub and main chain responsible for the overall security, consensus, and interoperability between all connected chains

- **System chains** - specialized chains that provide essential services to the ecosystem, like the Asset Hub, Bridge Hub, and Coretime chain

- **Parachains** -  individual, specialized blockchains that run parallel to the relay chain and are connected to it
