# Architecture

Explore Polkadot's architecture, including the relay chain, parachains, and system chains, and discover the role each component plays in the broader ecosystem.

## A Brief Look at Polkadot’s Chain Ecosystem

The following provides a brief overview of the role of each chain:

- [**Polkadot chain**](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/) - the central hub and main chain responsible for the overall security, consensus, and interoperability between all connected chains

- [**System chains**](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/) - specialized chains that provide essential services to the ecosystem, like the Asset Hub, Bridge Hub, and Coretime chain

- [**Parachains**](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/parachains/) -  individual, specialized blockchains that run parallel to the relay chain and are connected to it
