# Parachains

Discover how parachains secure their networks and reach consensus by harnessing Polkadot’s relay chain and its robust validator framework. This integrated architecture ensures shared security and seamless coordination across the entire ecosystem.

Parachains serve as the foundation of Polkadot’s multichain ecosystem, enabling diverse, application-specific blockchains to operate in parallel. By connecting to the relay chain, parachains gain access to Polkadot’s shared security, interoperability, and decentralized governance. This design allows developers to focus on building innovative features while benefiting from a secure and scalable infrastructure.
