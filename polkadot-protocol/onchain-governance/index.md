## Start Building Governance Solutions

To develop solutions related to Polkadot's governance system, it’s essential to understand three key pallets:

- **Preimage** - stores and manages the content or the detailed information of a referendum proposal before it is voted on
- **Referenda** - manages the lifecycle of a referendum, including proposal submission, voting, and execution. Once a referendum is proposed and voted on, it can be enacted if it passes the required threshold
- **Conviction Voting** - manages the voting power based on the "conviction" or commitment of voters, providing a more flexible and nuanced voting mechanism

These pallets work together to enable decentralized decision-making within the Polkadot network.
