## Introduction

Polkadot Hub is the entry point to Polkadot for all users and application developers. It provides access to essential Web3 services including smart contracts, staking, governance, identity management, and cross-ecosystem interoperability—without requiring you to deploy or manage a parachain.

The Hub encompasses a set of core functionality that enables developers and users to build and interact with applications on Polkadot. Rather than being a single chain, the Hub represents a collection of specialized system parachains and services working together seamlessly to deliver a unified platform experience. This modular approach allows you to interact with different services optimized for specific use cases, all while benefiting from Polkadot's shared security.

## What the Hub Provides

The Polkadot Hub enables a range of essential capabilities:

### Basic User Capabilities

Whether you're just getting started or building complex applications, the Hub supports:

- **Hold, send, and receive DOT** and other assets across the network
- **Stake DOT** to participate in network security and earn rewards
- **Vote in governance** referendums and shape Polkadot's future
- **Create assets** (both fungible tokens and NFTs) for your projects
- **Pay transaction fees** in any asset, not just DOT
- **Register as an individual** and establish your on-chain identity

### Advanced Developer Capabilities

For more sophisticated use cases, the Hub enables:

- **Deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts** using Solidity or other EVM languages
- **Build decentralized applications** that leverage Polkadot's security and interoperability
- **Create and manage fungible tokens and NFTs** with low fees and flexible operations
- **Manage cross-chain interactions** through XCM messaging with other parachains
- **Set verified identities** and apply for network opportunities like the Ambassador Program
- **Join collectives** and participate in governance organizations with specialized roles

## Core Components

The Polkadot Hub consists of several specialized system parachains and services working together:

### Smart Contracts

[Smart Contracts](/reference/polkadot-hub/smart-contracts/){target=\_blank} on Polkadot Hub enable developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts using Solidity and other familiar EVM languages. Build decentralized applications with full access to Polkadot's security, interoperability, and cross-chain capabilities. Smart contracts on the Hub benefit from lower fees and integration with native Polkadot features like identity management and asset operations.

### Asset Management

[Asset Management](/reference/polkadot-hub/assets/){target=\_blank} provides the foundation for on-chain asset management. Create, manage, and transfer fungible tokens and NFTs across the ecosystem. Asset Management offers significantly lower transaction fees—approximately one-tenth of relay chain costs—and reduced deposit requirements, making it ideal for projects managing digital assets at scale. It also enables payment of transaction fees in non-native assets, providing flexibility for developers and users.

### People Chain

[People Chain](/reference/polkadot-hub/people-and-identity/){target=\_blank} powers Polkadot's decentralized identity system. Establish verifiable on-chain identities, control disclosure of personal information, and receive verification from trusted registrars. People Chain enables secure identity management with hierarchical sub-account support, forming the foundation for trusted interactions throughout the ecosystem.

### Bridge Hub

[Bridge Hub](/reference/polkadot-hub/bridging/){target=\_blank} facilitates trustless interactions between Polkadot and external blockchains like Ethereum and Kusama. Through implementations like Snowbridge, Bridge Hub enables secure cross-chain communication using on-chain light clients and trustless relayers. This component ensures seamless interoperability beyond the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Consensus & Security

[Consensus and Security](/reference/polkadot-hub/consensus-and-security/){target=\_blank} covers the fundamental mechanisms that protect the network. Learn about validator participation, how the relay chain validates all transactions, and the cryptoeconomic incentives that secure Polkadot. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for validators and anyone building critical infrastructure on the network.

### Collectives & DAOs

[Collectives and DAOs](/reference/polkadot-hub/collectives-and-daos/){target=\_blank} enable specialized governance organizations within Polkadot. Participate in collective membership, manage treasury operations, and engage in coordinated decision-making with groups aligned around specific purposes. This functionality supports the creation of autonomous organizations on Polkadot.
