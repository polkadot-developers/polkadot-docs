# Deploy a Basic Contract with Foundry

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a basic Solidity smart contract to Polkadot Hub using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank}, which offers a fast, modular toolkit written in Rust. It's perfect for developers who prefer command-line interfaces and need high-performance compilation and deployment.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Solidity programming.
- Test tokens for gas fees (available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}). See the [step-by-step instructions](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank}.
- A wallet with a private key for signing transactions.

## Set Up Your Project

Install Foundry:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Initialize your project:

```bash
forge init foundry-deployment
cd foundry-deployment
```

## Configure Foundry

Edit `foundry.toml`:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

[rpc_endpoints]
polkadot_hub_testnet = "https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io"
```

## Create Your Contract

Replace the default contract in `src/Storage.sol`:

```solidity title="src/Storage.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Storage {
    uint256 private storedNumber;

    function store(uint256 num) public {
        storedNumber = num;
    }

    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedNumber;
    }
}
```

## Compile

```bash
forge build
```

Verify the compilation by inspecting the bytecode:

```bash
forge inspect Storage bytecode
```

## Deploy

Deploy to Polkadot Hub TestNet:

```bash
forge create Storage \
    --rpc-url polkadot_hub_testnet \
    --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --broadcast
```
Replace the `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` placeholder with your actual private key.
