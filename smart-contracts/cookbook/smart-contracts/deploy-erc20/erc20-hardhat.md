# Deploy an ERC-20 Using Hardhat

## Introduction

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank} tokens are fungible tokens commonly used for creating cryptocurrencies, governance tokens, and staking mechanisms. Polkadot Hub enables easy deployment of ERC-20 tokens via Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and tools.

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an ERC-20 contract on Polkadot Hub TestNet using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank}, an Ethereum development environment. The ERC-20 contract can be retrieved from OpenZeppelin's [GitHub repository]({{ dependencies.repositories.open_zeppelin_contracts.repository_url}}/tree/{{ dependencies.repositories.open_zeppelin_contracts.version}}/contracts/token/ERC20){target=\_blank} or generated with the [OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard for Polkadot](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/polkadot){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} programming and [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/){target=\_blank} fungible tokens.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\_blank} v22.13.1 or later installed.
- Test tokens for gas fees, available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. See [Get Test Tokens](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank} for a guide to using the faucet.
- A wallet with a private key for signing transactions.

## Set Up Your Project

This tutorial uses a [Hardhat ERC-20 template](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/tree/master/erc20-hardhat){target=\_blank} that contains all the necessary files. 

To get started, take the following steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/
    cd revm-hardhat-examples/erc20-hardhat
    ```

2. Install the dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
    
    This command will fetch all the necessary packages to help you use Hardhat to deploy an ERC-20 to Polkadot.

## Configure Hardhat

If you started with the cloned Hardhat ERC-20 template, `hardhat.config.ts` is already configured to deploy to the Polkadot TestNet as shown in the example below:

```ts title="hardhat.config.ts" hl_lines="14-19"
--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/refs/heads/master/erc20-hardhat/hardhat.config.ts::2"

--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/refs/heads/master/erc20-hardhat/hardhat.config.ts:24:45"
```

!!! tip
    Visit the Hardhat [Configuration variables](https://v2.hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables){target=\_blank} documentation to learn how to use Hardhat to handle your private keys securely.

## Compile the Contract 

Next, compile the contract included with the template by running the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

If everything compiles successfully, you will see output similar to the following:

--8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-hardhat/compile-output.html'

## Test the Contract

You can view the predefined test file at [`test/MyToken.test.ts`](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples/blob/master/erc20-hardhat/test/MyToken.test.ts){target=\_blank}. This example test includes verification of the following:

- The token name and symbol exist (confirms deployment) and are correct.
- The token owner is correctly configured.
- The initial token supply is zero.
- The owner can mint tokens.
- The total supply increases after a mint.
- Successful mints to different test addresses with expected account balance and total supply changes.

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test --network polkadotTestnet
```

If tests are successful, you will see outputs similar to the following:

--8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-hardhat/testing-output.html'

## Deploy the Contract

You are now ready to deploy the contract to your chosen network. This example demonstrates deployment to the Polkadot TestNet. Deploy the contract as follows:

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyToken.ts --network polkadotTestnet
    ```

2. Confirm the target deployment network name and chain ID when prompted:

    --8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-hardhat/deploy-output.html'

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed an ERC-20 token contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet using Hardhat. Consider the following resources to build upon your progress.
