# Deploy an ERC-721 Using Hardhat

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets commonly used for digital art, collectibles, gaming, and identity verification.

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721){target=\_blank} NFT contract to [Polkadot Hub](/smart-contracts/overview/#smart-contract-development){target=\_blank} TestNet. You'll use OpenZeppelin's battle-tested [NFT implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts){target=\_blank} and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/docs/getting-started){target=\_blank}, a comprehensive development environment with built-in testing, debugging, and deployment capabilities. Hardhat uses standard Solidity compilation to generate EVM bytecode, making it fully compatible with Polkadot Hub's EVM environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/){target=\_blank} programming and [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/){target=\_blank} non-fungible tokens.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\_blank} v22.13.1 or later installed.
- Test tokens for gas fees, available from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/){target=\_blank}. See [Get Test Tokens](/smart-contracts/faucet/#get-test-tokens){target=\_blank} for a guide to using the faucet.
- A wallet with a private key for signing transactions.

## Set Up Your Project

1. Use the following terminal commands to create a directory and initialize your Hardhat project inside of it:

    ```bash
    mkdir hardhat-nft-deployment
    cd hardhat-nft-deployment
    npx hardhat --init
    ```

2. Install the OpenZeppelin contract dependencies using the command:

    ```bash
    npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
    ```

## Configure Hardhat

Open `hardhat.config.ts` and update to add `polkadotHubTestnet` to the `networks` configuration as highlighted in the following example code:

```typescript title="hardhat.config.ts" hl_lines='39-44'
--8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-hardhat/hardhat.config.ts'
```

!!! tip
    Visit the Hardhat [Config Variables](https://hardhat.org/docs/learn-more/configuration-variables){target=\_blank} documentation to learn how to use Hardhat to handle your private keys securely.

## Create the Contract

Follow these steps to create your smart contract:

1. Delete the default contract file(s) in the `contracts` directory.

2. Create a new file named `MyNFT.sol` inside the `contracts` directory.

3. Add the following code to create the `MyNFT.sol` smart contract:
    ```solidity title="contracts/MyNFT.sol"
    --8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-hardhat/MyNFT.sol'
    ```

## Compile the Contract

Compile your `MyNFT.sol` contract using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

You will see a message in the terminal confirming the contract was successfully compiled, similar to the following:

--8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-hardhat/compile-output.html'

## Deploy the Contract

You are now ready to deploy the contract to your chosen network. This example demonstrates deployment to the Polkadot TestNet. Deploy the contract as follows:

1. Delete the default file(s) inside the `ignition/modules` directory.

2. Create a new file named `MyNFT.ts` inside the `ignition/modules` directory.

3. Open `ignition/modules/MyNFT.ts` and add the following code to create your deployment module:
    ```typescript title="ignition/modules/MyNFT.ts"
    --8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-hardhat/MyNFT.ts'
    ```

    Replace `INSERT_OWNER_ADDRESS` with your desired owner address.

4. Deploy your contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/MyNFT.ts --network polkadotHubTestnet
    ```

5. Confirm the target deployment network name and chain ID when prompted:

    --8<-- 'code/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-nft/nft-hardhat/deploy-output.html'

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed an ERC-721 NFT contract to Polkadot Hub TestNet using Hardhat. Consider the following resources to build upon your progress.
