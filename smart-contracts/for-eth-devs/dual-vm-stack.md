# Dual Virtual Machine Stack

--8<-- 'text/smart-contracts/polkaVM-warning.md'

## Introduction

Polkadot's smart contract platform supports two distinct virtual machine (VM) architectures, providing developers with flexibility in selecting the optimal execution backend for their specific needs. This approach strikes a balance between immediate Ethereum compatibility and long-term innovation, enabling developers to deploy either unmodified (Ethereum Virtual Machine) EVM contracts using Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine (REVM) or optimize for higher performance using PolkaVM (PVM).

Both VM options share common infrastructure, including RPC interfaces, tooling support, and precompiles. The following sections compare architectures and guide you in selecting the best VM for your project's needs.

## Migrate from EVM

The [REVM backend](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm){target=\_blank} integrates a complete Rust implementation of the EVM, enabling Solidity contracts to run unchanged on Polkadot's smart contract platform.

REVM allows developers to use their existing Ethereum tooling and infrastructure to build on Polkadot. Choose REVM to:

- Migrate existing Ethereum contracts without modifications.
- Retain exact EVM behavior for audit tools. 
- Use developer tools that rely upon inspecting EVM bytecode.
- Prioritize rapid deployment over optimization.
- Work with established Ethereum infrastructure and tooling to build on Polkadot.

REVM enables Ethereum developers to seamlessly migrate to Polkadot, achieving performance and fee improvements without modifying their existing contracts or developer tooling stack.

## Upgrade to PolkaVM

[**PolkaVM**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm){target=\_blank} is a custom virtual machine optimized for performance with [RISC-V-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V){target=\_blank} architecture, supporting Solidity and additional high-performance languages. It serves as the core execution environment, integrated directly within the runtime. Choose the PolkaVM for:

- An efficient interpreter for immediate code execution.
- A planned [Just In Time (JIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation){target=\_blank} compiler for optimized performance.
- Dual-mode execution capability, allowing selection of the most appropriate backend for specific workloads.
- Optimized performance for short-running contract calls through the interpreter.

The interpreter remains particularly beneficial for contracts with minimal code execution, as it enables immediate code execution through lazy interpretation.

## Architecture

The following key components of PolkaVM work together to enable Ethereum compatibility on Polkadot-based chains. 

### Revive Pallet

[**`pallet_revive`**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_revive/index.html){target=\_blank} is a runtime module that executes smart contracts by adding extrinsics, runtime APIs, and logic to convert Ethereum-style transactions into formats compatible with Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. It processes Ethereum-style transactions through the following workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/dApp
    participant Proxy as Ethereum JSON RPC Proxy
    participant Chain as Blockchain Node
    participant Pallet as pallet_revive
    
    User->>Proxy: Submit Ethereum Transaction
    Proxy->>Chain: Repackage as Polkadot Compatible Transaction
    Chain->>Pallet: Process Transaction
    Pallet->>Pallet: Decode Ethereum Transaction
    Pallet->>Pallet: Execute Contract via PolkaVM
    Pallet->>Chain: Return Results
    Chain->>Proxy: Forward Results
    Proxy->>User: Return Ethereum-compatible Response
```

This proxy-based approach eliminates the need for node binary modifications, maintaining compatibility across different client implementations. Preserving the original Ethereum transaction payload simplifies the adaptation of existing tools, which can continue processing familiar transaction formats.

### PolkaVM Design Fundamentals

PolkaVM differs from the EVM in two key ways that make it faster, more hardware-efficient, and easier to extend:

- **Register-based design**: Instead of a stack machine, PolkaVM uses a RISC-V–style register model. This design:

    - Uses a fixed set of registers to pass arguments, not an infinite stack.
    - Maps cleanly to real hardware like x86-64.
    - Simplifies compilation and boosts runtime efficiency.
    - Enables tighter control over register allocation and performance tuning.

- **64-bit word size**: PolkaVM runs on a native 64-bit word size, aligning directly with modern CPUs. This design:

    - Executes arithmetic operations with direct hardware support.
    - Maintains compatibility with Solidity’s 256-bit types via YUL translation.
    - Accelerates computation-heavy workloads through native word alignment.
    - Integrates easily with low-level, performance-focused components.
