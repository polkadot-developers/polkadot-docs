# Smart Contracts on Polkadot Hub

## Introduction

Polkadot Hub provides a production-ready smart contract platform that combines Ethereum compatibility with the performance and cross-chain capabilities of the Polkadot ecosystem. Developers can deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot Hub while using familiar Ethereum tooling, workflows, and programming languages.

Built with a dual-VM approach, Polkadot Hub offers two execution backends: REVM for unmodified EVM compatibility and native PolkaVM for optimized computationally expensive workloads. This dual-VM architecture enables developers to migrate existing Ethereum contracts instantly or optimize for speed and efficiency with native execution.

## Why Build on Polkadot Hub

### Ethereum Compatibility

Deploy existing Ethereum contracts with zero modifications while maintaining full compatibility with your existing development stack:

- **Complete JSON-RPC API support**: Use MetaMask, Hardhat, Remix, Foundry, and all standard Ethereum tooling.
- **Standard libraries**: Integrate Ethers.js, Web3.js, Viem, Wagmi, and Web3.py without changes.
- **Solidity development**: Write contracts in Solidity or migrate existing code directly.
- **Familiar workflows**: Maintain your existing deployment, testing, and monitoring processes.

### Performance Options

Choose between two execution backends:

- **REVM**: Run unmodified Ethereum contracts with full EVM/Ethereum compatibility.
- **PolkaVM**: Compile to optimized RISC-V bytecode for enhanced performance and lower fees while keeping Ethereum-compatibility.

Both backends share the same RPC interface and tooling support, allowing seamless transitions.

### Cross-VM  & Cross-Chain Capabilities

Smart contracts written for one VM (for example, EVM) can interact directly with other smart contracts written for the RISC-V PolkaVM, and back. This allows 

Furthermore, all smart contracts in Polkadot Hub can interact with any service in the Polkadot ecosystem through [XCM](/smart-contracts/precompiles/xcm/){target=\_blank}, enabling token transfers, remote execution, and cross-chain composability without bridges or intermediaries.

## Other Smart Contract Environments

Beyond Polkadot Hub's native PolkaVM support, the ecosystem offers two main alternatives for smart contract development:

- **EVM-compatible parachains**: Provide access to Ethereum's extensive developer ecosystem, smart contract portability, and established tooling like Hardhat, Remix, Foundry, and OpenZeppelin. The main options include Moonbeam (the first full Ethereum-compatible parachain serving as an interoperability hub), Astar (featuring dual VM support for both EVM and WebAssembly contracts), and Acala (DeFi-focused with enhanced Acala EVM+ offering advanced DeFi primitives).

- **Rust (ink!)**: ink! is a Rust-based framework that can compile to PolkaVM. It uses [`#[ink(...)]`](https://use.ink/docs/v6/macros-attributes/){target=\_blank} attribute macros to create Polkadot SDK-compatible PolkaVM bytecode, offering strong memory safety from Rust, an advanced type system, high-performance PolkaVM execution, and platform independence with sandboxed security.
