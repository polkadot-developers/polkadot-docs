# Build a Blockchain

Learn to build and manage Polkadot SDK-based blockchain nodes. These tutorials cover setup, networking, authorization, monitoring, and upgrades.

The Polkadot SDK enables you to create custom blockchains tailored to your needs. The following tutorials guide you through a complete workflow, from launching a single node to managing a network of validators:

- **Build a Local Solochain** - Compile and launch your first blockchain node using the Polkadot SDK Solochain Template. Learn to run a standalone node and interact with it through a web interface
- **Simulate a Network** - Create a multi-node network environment using predefined accounts. Learn how to connect peers and verify block production in a controlled setting
- **Add Trusted Nodes** - Set up a private blockchain network with authorized validators. Generate keys, create custom chain specifications, and manage node authorization
- **Upgrade a Running Network** - Perform forkless runtime upgrades to add features and modify parameters without disrupting network operations

By following along with these tutorials, you'll gain comprehensive experience with launching and managing blockchain nodes, including: 

- Node compilation and deployment
- Network configuration and peer connectivity
- Validator authorization and key management
- Runtime upgrades and network maintenance

Each tutorial builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive foundation for developing and managing your own blockchain using the Polkadot SDK.
