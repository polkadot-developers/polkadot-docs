# Build a Blockchain

The Polkadot SDK enables you to create custom blockchains tailored to your needs. The following tutorials guide you through a complete workflow, from launching a single node to managing a network of validators. You'll start by building a standalone node, then create multi-node test networks, set up private networks with authorized validators, and implement runtime upgrades.

Each tutorial builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive foundation for developing and managing your own blockchain using the Polkadot SDK.
