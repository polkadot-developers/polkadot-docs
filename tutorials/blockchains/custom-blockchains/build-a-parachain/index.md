# Build a Parachain

These tutorials guide you through the process of building and deploying a parachain, from setting up a local test environment to connecting with a public TestNet:

- **Prepare a Relay Chain** - Set up a local relay chain with multiple validator nodes for parachain testing and development
- **Connect a Parachain** - Create and configure a parachain to connect with your local relay chain, including reserving ParaIDs and managing genesis state
- **Acquire a TestNet Slot** - Deploy your parachain to a public TestNet like Paseo, including obtaining tokens, reserving slots, and managing collator nodes

Through these tutorials, you'll learn essential parachain development skills including:

- Relay chain configuration and management
- Parachain registration and slot acquisition
- Genesis state and runtime preparation
- Network configuration and validation
- TestNet deployment procedures

Each tutorial builds upon previous concepts, providing a comprehensive path from local development to public network deployment.
