# Build a Parachain

These tutorials guide you through the complete parachain development journey, from local testing to public deployment. Starting with local relay chain setup and validator configuration, you'll learn to connect your first parachain, manage Parachain IDs, and handle genesis state. The guides then progress to public TestNet deployment on networks like Paseo, covering essential skills such as slot acquisition, collator node management, and runtime preparation. Each tutorial builds systematically on previous concepts, providing a clear path from initial development to launching a production-ready parachain.
