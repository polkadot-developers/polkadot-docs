# Build Decentralized Applications on Polkadot

This section provides hands-on tutorials for building decentralized applications (dApps) using the Polkadot SDK and its developer toolkits. These guides help you leverage Polkadot's infrastructure to build scalable, secure, and interoperable dApps without relying solely on smart contracts.

You'll explore a range of topics—from client-side apps and CLI tools to on-chain interaction patterns—all backed by lightweight or full-node tooling.
