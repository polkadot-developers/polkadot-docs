# Cross-Chain Interoperability Tutorials

In this section, you will explore the core interoperability solutions of the Polkadot ecosystem through hands-on tutorials. Polkadot enables seamless cross-chain communication and collaboration using two primary methods:

- **XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging)** – a secure and trustless framework that facilitates communication between parachains, relay chains, and external blockchains, enabling asset transfers, data sharing, and complex cross-chain workflows

- **Bridges** – extend interoperability beyond the Polkadot network by connecting to external blockchains. This enables the integration of external assets, unlocking liquidity and enhancing the functionality of Polkadot-based applications

These tutorials will provide a step-by-step approach to mastering cross-chain interoperability, covering everything from setting up XCM channels to transferring assets and executing remote calls across different chains.
