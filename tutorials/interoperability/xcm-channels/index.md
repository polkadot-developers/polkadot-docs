# Tutorials for Managing XCM Channels

Establishing XCM channels is a prerequisite to fully leveraging Polkadot's chain interoperability. Before bridging assets or sending cross-chain contract calls, the requisite XCM channels must be established. XCM channels are unidirectional; by default, all parachains on Polkadot start with two channels already open - one to send messages to the relay chain and another to receive messages from the relay chain. The tutorials in this section focus on parachain to parachain XCM channels, as well as parachain to system chain channels, such as Asset Hub.

These tutorials guide you through setting up HRMP channels for cross-chain messaging:

- **Opening HRMP Channels Between Parachains** - Learn to establish unidirectional channels between regular parachains using the request and accept process
- **Opening HRMP Channels with System Parachains** - Create bidirectional channels with system parachains like Asset Hub using a simplified single-message process
