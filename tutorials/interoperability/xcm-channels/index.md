# Tutorials for Managing XCM Channels

Establishing XCM channels is a prerequisite to fully leveraging Polkadot's powerful native interoperability. Before bridging assets or sending cross-chain contract calls, the requisite XCM channels must be established. XCM channels are unidirectional; by default, all parachains on Polkadot start with two channels already open - one to send messages to the relay chain and another to receive messages from the relay chain. The tutorials in this section focus on parachain to parachain XCM channels, as well as parachain to system chain channels, such as Asset Hub.

These tutorials show you how to set up HRMP channels for cross-chain messaging, covering both the request-and-accept process for unidirectional channels between regular parachains and the simplified single-message process for bidirectional channels with system parachains like Asset Hub.
