# XCM Observability

## Introduction

This guide explains how to **trace, correlate, and debug cross-chain XCMs** using observability features introduced in the Polkadot SDK.

You will learn how to:

* Understand and use `SetTopic` and `message_id` for tracking
* Replay and dry-run XCMs across parachains
* Match `Sent` and `Processed` events across chains
* Debug failed or incomplete messages using Chopsticks logs

This tutorial is essential for developers working on multi-hop XCMs, custom integrations, or bridges where traceability and debuggability are critical.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you should have:

* Basic knowledge of Polkadot SDK and XCM
* [Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) installed (`npm i -g @acala-network/chopsticks`)
* A working local development environment (NodeJS, TypeScript)
* [Polkadot API (PAPI)](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) installed
* Access to the Wasm runtimes of the relevant parachains (e.g., Asset Hub, Acala)

You should also be familiar with forking chains using Chopsticks. If not, see [Fork a Chain with Chopsticks](https://docs.polkadot.com/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/).

## Define a Scenario: DOT to Acala Transfer with Tracing

We will explore the full lifecycle of a cross-chain message from Polkadot Asset Hub to Acala, using the `limited_reserve_transfer_assets` extrinsic.

* **Origin Chain**: Polkadot Asset Hub
* **Destination Chain**: Acala
* **Extrinsic**: `limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
* **Goal**: Transfer DOT and trace the XCM message using the emitted `message_id`

This scenario will demonstrate how `SetTopic` is added (or generated), how to find matching `Sent` and `Processed` events, and how to debug execution failures if they occur.

---

## Step 1: Launch a Fork with Logging Enabled

To view full logs and track `SetTopic`, override the runtime with a locally built Wasm.

* Fork Polkadot Asset Hub and Acala at the relevant block heights
* Override the Wasm to enable logging
* Use a custom Chopsticks config to load your Wasm

â†’ See the detailed steps in [Replay and Dry Run XCMs Guide](https://docs.polkadot.com/tutorials/interoperability/replay-and-dry-run-xcms/).

---

## Step 2: Execute the Transfer with `SetTopic`

We execute a script that sends DOT to Acala with an optional manually defined `SetTopic`.

```ts
--8<-- 'code/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/replay-and-dry-run-xcms/limited-reserve-transfer-assets.ts'
```

You can run this script with:

```bash
npx tsx limited-reserve-transfer-assets.ts
```

---

## Step 3: Track the Message Across Chains

After submission, you can match events using the `message_id`:

| Chain              | Event                    | Field        | Notes                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Polkadot Asset Hub | `PolkadotXcm.Sent`       | `message_id` | Emitted automatically or from SetTopic |
| Acala              | `MessageQueue.Processed` | `id`         | Matches message ID from origin chain   |

### Example Log Output

```bash
ðŸ“£ Sent: 0xb4b8d2c8...
ðŸ“£ Processed: 0xb4b8d2c8...
âœ… Message ID matched
```

â†’ Matching confirms that the message was received and executed on the destination chain.

---

## Step 4: Debug Failures

If your XCM fails, you can debug using one of the following:

### View Nested Errors

Most indexers show the outermost error (e.g., `LocalExecutionIncompleteWithError`), which is often enough to understand basic failures.

### Use Chopsticks for Full Logs

With logging enabled, Chopsticks will show:

* Which instruction failed
* Full error chain (e.g., `FailedToTransactAsset`, `AssetNotFound`)
* Precise reason for rollback or halt

â†’ Useful for understanding weight failures, malformed assets, or execution mismatches.

---

## Step 5: Handle Older Runtimes

Older runtimes use a **derived `forwarded_id`** in `Processed` events instead of the original topic hash.

```ts
// Calculate forwarded ID for legacy chains
const input = u8aConcat(stringToU8a("forward_id_for"), messageIdBytes);
const forwardedId = blake2AsU8a(input);
```

â†’ Tools must check both the `original_id` and `forwarded_id` when indexing older chains.

---

## Additional Samples

After learning the concepts above, you can explore other scenarios:

### `multiple-hops-sample-01.ts`

Transfers assets across multiple chains with auto-generated `SetTopic`.

### `multiple-hops-sample-02.ts`

Transfers assets and explicitly sets a known `SetTopic` for full tracking across multiple hops.

### `hydration-sample1.ts`

Simulates a swap using DOT on Hydration, then returns funds back to the origin.

â†’ Run each script using `npx tsx <script>.ts`

Each sample includes inline comments and tracking info relevant to its use case.
