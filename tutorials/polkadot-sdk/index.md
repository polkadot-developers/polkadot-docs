# Polkadot SDK Tutorials

The Polkadot SDK provides a powerful framework for building custom blockchains that can operate either independently or as part of the larger Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot SDK encompasses a modular and extensible set of tools, libraries, and runtime components to streamline the creation of parachains, system chains, and standalone Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. These tutorials guide you through your blockchain development journey, from creating your first local chain to deploying production-ready parachains.

## A Journey Through the Polkadot SDK

### Start with a Solochain
A great way to familiarize yourself with the Polkadot SDK is by [launching a solochain](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/local-chain/){target=\_blank} - a standalone blockchain that lets you experiment freely in a local environment. In this [solochain tutorial](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/local-chain/){target=\_blank}, you'll:

- Launch your first node and interact with it through a web interface
- Create a multi-node network with pre-configured accounts
- Perform runtime upgrades to add features to your running chain

### Graduate to Parachain Development
Ready to connect your blockchain to the Polkadot ecosystem? Learn to transform your chain into a parachain:

- Set up a [local relay chain testing environment](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/prepare-relay-chain/){target=\_blank}
- Deploy to [public TestNets](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/acquire-a-testnet-slot/){target=\_blank} and manage collator nodes

### Integrate with System Chains
Enhance your parachain's capabilities by integrating with Polkadot's specialized system chains, like Asset Hub:

- Register [local](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-asset/){target=\_blank} and [foreign assets](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-asset/){target=\_blank}
- [Create and manage liquidity pools](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/){target=\_blank}

### Master Testing Tools
Ensure the integrity and reliability of your blockchain with Polkadot's specialized testing tools:

- [Create ephemeral test networks with Zombienet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/spawn-basic-chain/){target=\_blank}
- [Fork live chains for local testing with Chopsticks](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/testing/fork-live-chains/){target=\_blank}
