# Pallet Unit Testing

## Introduction

You have learned how to create a custom pallet in the [Build the Pallet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/){target=\_blank} tutorial; now you will see how to test the pallet to ensure that it works as expected. As stated in the [Pallet Testing](/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/pallet-testing/){target=\_blank} article, unit testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of pallets in Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. Comprehensive testing helps validate pallet functionality, prevent potential bugs, and maintain the integrity of your blockchain logic.

This tutorial will guide you through creating a unit testing suite for a custom pallet built in the previous tutorial, covering essential testing aspects and steps.

## Prerequisites

To set up your testing environment for Polkadot SDK pallets, you'll need:

- Rust installation
- Basic understanding of Substrate/Polkadot SDK concepts
- A custom pallet implementation, check the [Build the Pallet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/){target=\_blank} tutorial
- Familiarity with [Rust testing frameworks](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html){target=\_blank}

## Set Up the Testing Environment

### Create Test Configuration Files

To effectively create the test environment for your pallet, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Add the required dependencies to your test configuration in the `Cargo.toml` file of the pallet:

    ```toml
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/Cargo-dev-dependencies.toml'
    ```

2. Create a `mock.rs` and a `tests.rs` files (leave these files empty for now, they will be filled in later):

    ```bash
    touch mock.rs
    touch tests.rs
    ```

3. Include them in your `lib.rs` module:

    ```rust
    #[cfg(test)]
    mod mock;

    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests;
    ```

## Implement Mocked Runtime

Mocking the runtime creates an isolated testing environment for your Polkadot SDK pallet. This lightweight runtime simulation allows you to test pallet functionality in a controlled setting with custom parameters and configuration. To do so, you can add the following to your `mock.rs` file:

```rust
--8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/mock.rs'
```

!!! note
    The code snippet above defines a mock runtime (`Test`) with essential configurations and includes and configures the `CustomPallet` for isolated test execution. It sets the `CounterMaxValue` constant to 10, defining the maximum allowed value for the counter in tests. The `new_test_ext()` function initializes a mock runtime environment with a default genesis configuration, enabling isolated and reproducible testing for the pallet.


## Implement Test Cases

Unit testing a pallet involves creating a comprehensive test suite that validates various scenarios. You ensure your palletâ€™s reliability, security, and expected behavior under different conditions by systematically testing successful operations, error handling, event emissions, state modifications, and access control.

The following sub-sections will show scenarios where the `custom-pallet` can be tested. Feel free to add these snippets to your `tests.rs` while you read the examples.

### Successful Operations

Verify that the counter can be successfully incremented under normal conditions, ensuring the increment works and the correct event is emitted.

```rust
--8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/tests.rs:38:54'
```

### Preventing Value Overflow

Test that the pallet prevents incrementing beyond the maximum allowed value, protecting against unintended state changes.

```rust
--8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/tests.rs:56:68'
```

### Origin and Access Control

Confirm that sensitive operations like setting counter value are restricted to authorized origins, preventing unauthorized modifications.

```rust
--8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/tests.rs:15:26'
```

### Edge Case Handling

Ensure the pallet gracefully handles edge cases, such as preventing increment operations that would cause overflow.

```rust
--8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/tests.rs:70:83'
```

### Verifying State Changes

Test that pallet operations modify the internal state correctly and maintain expected storage values across different interactions.

```rust
--8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/tests.rs:114:129'
```

You can check the complete `tests.rs` implementation for the `custom pallet` here:

???+ "Complete `tests.rs` Code"

    ```rust
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/tests.rs'
    ```


## Running Tests

Execute the test suite for your custom pallet using Cargo's test command. This will run all defined test cases and provide detailed output about the test results.

```bash
cargo test -p custom-pallet
```

After running the test suite, you should see the following output in your terminal:

--8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/build-custom-pallet/pallet-unit-testing/output.html'
