# Build a Parachain

These tutorials guide you through the process of building and deploying a parachain, from setting up a local test environment to connecting with a public TestNet:  These tutorials guide you through the complete parachain development journey, from local testing to public deployment. Starting with local relay chain setup and validator configuration, you'll learn to connect your first parachain, manage Parachain IDs, and handle genesis state. The guides then progress to public TestNet deployment on networks like Paseo, covering essential skills such as slot acquisition, collator node management, and runtime preparation. Each tutorial builds systematically on previous concepts, providing a clear path from initial development to launching a production-ready parachain.

- **Prepare a Relay Chain** - Set up a local relay chain with multiple validator nodes for parachain testing and development    
- **Connect a Parachain** - Create and configure a parachain to connect with your local relay chain, including reserving ParaIDs and managing genesis state 
- **Acquire a TestNet Slot** - Deploy your parachain to a public TestNet like Paseo, including obtaining tokens, reserving slots, and managing collator nodes   

Through these tutorials, you'll learn essential parachain development skills including: 

- Relay chain configuration and management  
- Parachain registration and slot acquisition   
- Genesis state and runtime preparation 
- Network configuration and validation  
- TestNet deployment procedures 

Each tutorial builds upon previous concepts, providing a comprehensive path from local development to public network deployment.
