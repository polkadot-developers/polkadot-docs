# Connect to a Relay Chain

Ready to connect your parachain to Polkadot? Follow these tutorials to build and deploy a parachain:

- **[Prepare a Relay Chain](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/prepare-relay-chain/){target=\_blank}** - Set up a local relay chain with multiple validator nodes for parachain testing and development 
- **[Prepare a Parachain](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/prepare-parachain/){target=\_blank}** - Create and configure a parachain to connect with your local relay chain, including reserving ParachainIDs and managing genesis state
- **[Acquire a TestNet Slot](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/acquire-a-testnet-slot/){target=\_blank}** - Deploy your parachain to a public TestNet like Paseo, including obtaining tokens, reserving slots, and managing collator nodes   

Through these tutorials, you'll learn essential parachain development skills including: 

- Relay chain configuration and management  
- Parachain registration and slot acquisition   
- Genesis state and runtime preparation 
- Network configuration and validation  
- TestNet deployment procedures 

Each tutorial builds upon previous concepts, providing a comprehensive path from local development to public network deployment.
