# Tutorials for Building Parachains with the Polkadot SDK

The Polkadot SDK enables you to build custom blockchains that can operate either independently or as part of the Polkadot network. These tutorials guide you through two main development paths: building a standalone chain (solochain) or creating a parachain that connects to Polkadot.

## Local Development

Start by learning the fundamentals through these local development tutorials:

- **[Launch a Local Solochain](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/local-chain/launch-a-local-solochain/)** - compile and run your first blockchain node
- **[Connect Multiple Nodes](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/local-chain/connect-multiple-nodes/)** - use predefined accounts to create a basic network
- **[Spin Up Your Nodes](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/local-chain/connect-multiple-nodes/)** - set up a network with custom validators and Aura consensus
- **[Upgrade a Running Network](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/local-chain/connect-multiple-nodes/)** - perform forkless runtime upgrades to add features

## Parachain Development

Ready to connect your parachain to Polkadot? Follow these tutorials to build and deploy a parachain:

- **[Prepare a Relay Chain](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/prepare-relay-chain/)** - set up a local relay chain for testing
- **[Prepare a Parachain](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/prepare-parachain/)** - configure and connect your parachain to the relay chain
- **[Acquire a TestNet Slot](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/connect-to-relay-chain/acquire-a-testnet-slot/)** - deploy your parachain to the Paseo TestNet

## Key Takeaways

Through these tutorials, you'll gain practical experience with:

- Node operation and network setup
- Chain configuration and consensus
- Runtime development and upgrades
- Parachain deployment and management

Each tutorial builds upon previous concepts while providing flexibility to focus on your specific development goals, whether that's building a standalone chain or a fully integrated parachain.
