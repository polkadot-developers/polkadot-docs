# Tutorials for Building Parachains with the Polkadot SDK

The Polkadot SDK offers a comprehensive set of tools and libraries to support parachain development, enabling developers to build custom blockchains that integrate with the Polkadot network.

These step-by-step tutorials cover the entire process, from creating standalone chains with their own validator networks to developing parachains that connect to Polkadot's relay chain for shared security and cross-chain communication. Each tutorial provides practical guidance to help you gain hands-on experience and build solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem.
