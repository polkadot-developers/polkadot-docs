# Tutorials for Building Parachains with the Polkadot SDK

The Polkadot SDK offers a comprehensive set of tools and libraries to support parachain development, enabling developers to build custom blockchains that integrate with the Polkadot network. These tutorials guide you through the process of building and deploying a parachain, from setting up a local test environment to connecting with a public TestNet:

- **Prepare a Relay Chain** - Set up a local relay chain with multiple validator nodes for parachain testing and development
- **Connect a Parachain** - Create and configure a parachain to connect with your local relay chain, including reserving ParaIDs and managing genesis state
- **Acquire a TestNet Slot** - Deploy your parachain to a public TestNet like Paseo, including obtaining tokens, reserving slots, and managing collator nodes

Through these tutorials, you'll learn essential parachain development skills including:

- Relay chain configuration and management
- Parachain registration and slot acquisition
- Genesis state and runtime preparation
- Network configuration and validation
- TestNet deployment procedures

Each tutorial builds upon previous concepts, providing a comprehensive path from local development to public network deployment.
