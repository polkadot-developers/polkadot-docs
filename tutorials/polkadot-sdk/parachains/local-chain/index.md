# Build a Solochain

This section provides practical, step-by-step tutorials for building and managing your own local solochain using the Polkadot SDK. A solochain is a standalone blockchain, typically used for testing, experimentation, or creating a custom blockchain that doesn't require integration with the Polkadot relay chain. You can customize your solochain to fit your exact needs. The following tutorials guide you through a complete workflow, from launching a single node to managing a network of validators:

- **Launch a Local Solochain** - Compile and launch your first blockchain node using the Polkadot SDK Solochain Template. Learn to run a standalone node and interact with it through the Polkadot.js Apps interface

- **Connect Predefined Accounts** - Create a multi-node network environment using predefined accounts (Alice and Bob). Learn how to connect peers and verify block production in a controlled setting

- **Spin Your Own Nodes** - Set up a private blockchain network with your own authorized validators. Generate keys, create custom chain specifications, and manage node authorization using Aura consensus

- **Upgrade a Running Network** - Perform forkless runtime upgrades to add features and modify parameters without disrupting network operations. Learn to add pallets and update runtime configuration

By following along with these tutorials, you'll gain comprehensive experience with launching and managing blockchain nodes, including: 	

- Node compilation and deployment	
- Network configuration and peer connectivity	
- Validator authorization and key management	
- Runtime upgrades and network maintenance
