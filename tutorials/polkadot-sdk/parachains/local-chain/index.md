# Build a Solochain

This section provides a practical, step-by-step tutorials for building and managing your own local solochain using the Polkadot SDK. A solochain is a standalone blockchain, typically used for testing, experimentation, or creating a custom blockchain that doesnâ€™t require integration with the Polkadot relay chain.
