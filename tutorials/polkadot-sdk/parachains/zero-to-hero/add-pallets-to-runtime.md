# Add Pallets to the Runtime

## Introduction

In previous tutorials, you learned how to [create a custom pallet](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/build-custom-pallet/){target=\_blank} and [test it](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/pallet-unit-testing/){target=\_blank}. The next step is to include this pallet in your runtime, integrating it into the core logic of your blockchain.

This tutorial will guide you through adding two pallets to your runtime: the custom pallet you previously developed and the [utility pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_utility/index.html){target=\_blank}. This standard Polkadot SDK pallet provides powerful dispatch functionality. The utility pallet offers, for example, batch dispatch, a stateless operation that enables executing multiple calls in a single transaction.

## Add the Pallets as Dependencies

First, you'll update the runtime's `Cargo.toml` file to include the Utility pallet and your custom pallets as dependencies for the runtime. Follow these steps:

Update the runtime's `Cargo.toml` file to include the utility pallet and your custom pallets as dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `runtime/Cargo.toml` file and locate the `[dependencies]` section. Add the pallets with the following lines:

    ```toml hl_lines="3-4"
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/Cargo.toml:19:19'
    ...
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/Cargo.toml:74:75'
    ```

2. In the `[features]` section, add the pallets to the `std` feature list:

    ```toml hl_lines="5-6"
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/Cargo.toml:77:79'
        ...
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/Cargo.toml:132:133'
    ```

3. Save the changes and close the `Cargo.toml` file

### Update the Runtime Configuration

Configure the pallets by implementing their `Config` trait and update the runtime macro to include the new pallets:

1. Add the `OriginCaller` import:
    ```rust
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/config-mod.rs:64:64'
    ```

2. Implement the [`Config`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_utility/pallet/trait.Config.html){target=\_blank} trait for both pallets at the end of the `runtime/src/config/mod.rs` file:

    ```rust
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/config-mod.rs:313'
    ```

3. Locate the `#[frame_support::runtime]` macro in the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file and add the pallets:

    ```rust hl_lines="5-9"
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/lib.rs:250:252'
    ...
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/add-pallets-to-runtime/lib.rs:312:317'
    ```

## Recompile the Runtime

After adding and configuring your pallets in the runtime, the next step is to ensure everything is set up correctly. To do this, recompile the runtime using the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This command ensures the runtime compiles without errors, validates the pallet configurations, and prepares the build for subsequent testing or deployment.

## Run Your Chain Locally

Launch your parachain locally and start producing blocks:

1. Create a new chain specification file with the updated runtime:

    ```bash
    chain-spec-builder create -t development \
    --relay-chain paseo \
    --para-id 1000 \
    --runtime ./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
    named-preset development
    ```

2. Start the omni node with the generated chain specification:

    ```bash
    polkadot-omni-node --chain ./chain_spec.json --dev
    ```

3. Verify you can interact with the new pallets using the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} interface. Navigate to the **Extrinsics** tab and check that you can see both pallets:
