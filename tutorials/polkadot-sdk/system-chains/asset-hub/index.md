# Asset Hub Tutorials

## Benefits of Asset Hub

Polkadot SDK-based relay chains focus on security and consensus, leaving asset management to an external component, such as a [system chain](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/){target=\_blank}. The [Asset Hub](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub/){target=\_blank} is one example of a system chain and is vital to managing tokens which aren't native to the Polkadot ecosystem. Developers opting to integrate with Asset Hub can expect the following benefits:

- **Support for non-native on-chain assets** - create and manage your own tokens or NFTs with Polkadot ecosystem compatibility available out of the box
- **Lower transaction fees** - approximately 1/10th of the cost of using the relay chain
- **Reduced deposit requirements** - approximately 1/100th of the deposit required for the relay chain
- **Payment of fees with non-native assets** - no need to buy native tokens for gas, increasing flexibility for developers and users

## Get Started

Through these tutorials, you'll learn how to manage cross-chain assets, including:

- Asset registration and configuration
- Cross-chain asset representation
- Liquidity pool creation and management 
- Asset swapping and conversion
- Transaction parameter optimization
