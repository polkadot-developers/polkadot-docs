# System Chains Tutorials

In this section, you'll gain hands-on experience building solutions that integrate with system chains on Polkadot using the Polkadot SDK. System chains like the Asset Hub provide essential infrastructure for enabling cross-chain interoperability and asset management across the Polkadot ecosystem. Through these tutorials, you'll learn how to leverage these system chains to enhance the functionality and security of your blockchain applications.

The Asset Hub system chain (formerly known as Statemint) provides robust asset management capabilities across the Polkadot ecosystem. Learn how to:

- Register and manage different types of assets
- Create and manage liquidity pools
- Perform asset conversions and trades
- Handle both local and foreign assets

The tutorials provide step-by-step guidance for both testing environments and production deployments, helping you build secure and efficient asset management solutions. By following these tutorials, you'll develop practical experience with:

- Asset registration and management workflows
- Cross-chain asset transfers and conversions
- Integration with system chain functionality
- Testing and deploying system chain interactions
