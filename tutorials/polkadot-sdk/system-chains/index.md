# System Chains Tutorials

In this section, you'll gain hands-on experience building solutions that integrate with system chains on Polkadot using the Polkadot SDK. System chains like the Asset Hub provide essential infrastructure for enabling cross-chain interoperability and asset management across the Polkadot ecosystem. Through these tutorials, you'll learn how to leverage these system chains to enhance the functionality and security of your blockchain applications.

The Asset Hub system chain (formerly known as Statemint) provides robust asset management capabilities across the Polkadot ecosystem. Learn how to:

- **[Register a Local Asset](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-asset/){target=\_blank}** - create and configure new assets directly on Asset Hub with custom parameters like metadata and minimum balances
- **[Register a Foreign Asset](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-asset/){target=\_blank}** - connect assets from other parachains to Asset Hub using XCM for cross-chain functionality 
- **[Convert Assets](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/){target=\_blank}** - use Asset Hub's AMM functionality to swap between different assets, provide liquidity to pools, and manage LP tokens
