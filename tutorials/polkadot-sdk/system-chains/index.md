# System Chains Tutorials

In this section, you'll gain hands-on experience building solutions that integrate with [system chains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub/){target=\_blank} on Polkadot using the Polkadot SDK. System chains like the Asset Hub provide essential infrastructure for enabling cross-chain interoperability and asset management across the Polkadot ecosystem. Through these tutorials, you'll learn how to leverage these system chains to enhance the functionality and security of your blockchain applications.

## For Parachain Integrators

Enhance cross-chain interoperability and expand your parachain’s functionality:

- **[Register your parachain's asset on Asset Hub](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-asset/){target=\_blank}** - connect your parachain’s assets to Asset Hub as a foreign asset using XCM, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers and integration

## For Developers Leveraging System Chains

Unlock new possibilities by tapping into Polkadot’s system chains:

- **[Register a new asset on Asset Hub](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-asset/){target=\_blank}** - create and customize assets directly on Asset Hub (local assets) with parameters like metadata, minimum balances, and more

- **[Convert Assets](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/){target=\_blank}** - use Asset Hub's AMM functionality to swap between different assets, provide liquidity to pools, and manage LP tokens
